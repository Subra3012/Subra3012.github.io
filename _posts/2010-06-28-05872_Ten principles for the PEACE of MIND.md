## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Ten principles for the PEACE of MIND  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 28, 2010, 10:06:41 AM

**1\. Do Not Interfere In Others ' Business Unless Asked.  
Most of us create our own problems by interfering too often in others'  
affairs. We do so because somehow we have convinced ourselves that our way is  
the best way, our logic is the perfect logic and those who do not conform to  
our thinking must be criticized and steered to the right direction, our  
direction. This thinking denies the existence of individuality and  
consequently the existence of God.. God has created each one of us in a unique  
way. No two human beings can think or act in exactly the same way. All men or  
women act the way they do because God within them prompts them that way. Mind  
your own business and you will keep your peace.   
**2\. Forgive And Forget:**   
This is the most powerful aid to peace of mind. We often develop ill feelings  
inside our heart for the person who insults us or harms us. We nurture  
grievances. This in turn results in loss of sleep, development of stomach  
ulcers, and high blood pressure. This insult or injury was done once, but  
nourishing of grievance goes on forever by constantly remembering it. Get over  
this bad habit. Life is too short to waste in such trifles. Forgive,20Forget,  
and march on. Love flourishes in giving and forgiving.   
**3\. Do Not Crave For Recogniti  
DateTime: This world is full of selfish people. They seldom praise anybody without  
selfish motives. They may praise you today because you are in power, but no  
sooner than you are powerless, they will forget your achievement and will  
start finding faults in you. Why do you wish to kill yourse lf in striving for  
their recognition? Their recognition is not worth the aggravation. Do your  
duties ethically and sincerely.   
**4\. Do Not Be Jealous:**   
We all have experienced how jealousy can disturb our peace of mind. You know  
that you work harder than your colleagues in the office, but sometimes they  
get promotions; you do not. You started a business several years ago, but you  
are not as successful as your neighbor whose business is only one year old.  
There are several examples like these in everyday life. Should you be jealous?  
No. Remember everybody's life is shaped by his/her destiny, which has now  
become his/her reality. If you are destined to be rich, nothing in the world  
can stop you. If you are not so destined, no one can help you either. Nothing  
will be gained by blaming others for your misfortune. Jealousy will not get  
you anywhere; it will only take away your peace of mind.   
**5\. Change Yourself According To The Environment:**   
If you try to change the environment single-handedly, the chances are you will  
fail. Instead, change yourself to suit your environment. As you do this, even  
the environment, which has been unfriendly to you, will mysteriously change  
and seem congenial and harmonious.   
**6\. Endure What Cannot Be Cured:**   
This is the best way to turn a disadvantage into an advantage. Every day we  
face numerous inconveniences, ailments, irritations, and accidents that are  
beyond our control. If we cannot control them or change them, we must learn to  
put up with these things. We must learn to endure them cheerfully. Believe in  
yourself and you will gain in terms of patience, inner strength and will  
power.   
**7\. Do Not Bite Off More Than You Can Chew:**   
This maxim needs to be remembered constantly. We often tend to take more  
responsibilities than we are capable of carrying out. This is done to satisfy  
our ego. Know your limitations.. Why take on additional loads that may create  
more worries? You cannot gain peace of mind by expanding your external  
activities. Reduce your material engagements and spend time in prayer,  
introspection and meditation. This will reduce those thoughts in your mind  
that make you restless. Uncluttered mind will produce greater peace of mind.   
**8\. Meditate Regularly:**   
Meditation calms the mind and gets rid of disturbing thoughts. This is the  
highest state of peace of mind. Try and experience it yourself. If you  
meditate earnestly for half an hour everyday, your mind will tend to become  
peaceful during the remaining twenty-three and half-hours. Your mind will not  
be easily disturbed as it was before. You would benefit by gradually  
increasing the period of daily meditation. You may think that this will  
interfere with your daily work. On the contrary, this will increase your  
efficiency and you will be able to produce better results in less time.   
**9\. Never Leave The Mind Vacant:**   
An empty mind is the devil's workshop. All evil actions start in the vacant  
mind. Keep your mind occupied in something positive, something worthwhile.  
Actively follow a hobby. Do something that holds your interest. You must  
decide what you value more: money or peace of mind. Your hobby, like social  
work or religious work, may not always earn you more money, but you will have  
a sense of fulfillment and achievement. Even when you are resting physically,  
occupy yourself in healthy reading or mental chanting of God's name.   
**10\. Do Not Procrastinate And Never Regret:**   
Do not waste time in protracted wondering " Should I or shouldn't I?" Days,  
weeks, months, and years may be wasted in that futile mental debating. You can  
never plan enough because you can never anticipate all future happenings.  
Value your time and do the things that need to be done. It does not matter if  
you fail the first time. You can learn from your mistakes and succeed the next  
time. Sitting back and worrying will lead to nothing. Learn from your  
mistakes, but do not brood over the past. DO NOT REGRET. Whatever happened was  
destined to happen only that way. Why cry over spilt milk?

Mind can never be kept empty. The best way, in my view, is to   
keep it engaged in sattvic work, like gardening, telling beads, or   
some non-profit social work like teaching children, learning simple   
new arts like singing Bhagavan Ramana's poems in a low tone and   
enjoying the contents and the music. When one goes to bed, before   
you get into deep sleep, chant some holy names.

well said Subramanian garu.   
Once there was discussion between Varanasi Subbalakshmi garu and bhagavan and  
it goes like this   
Quote  
V S : "What have I got except endless work in the kitchen?" Bhagavan said  
with deep feeling: B: "Your hands may do the work but your mind can remain still.   
You are that which never move Realize that and you will find that work is not  
a strain.   
But as long as you think that you are the body and that the work is done by  
you,you will feel your life to be an endless toil.   
In fact, it is the mind that toils, not the body.   
Even if your body keeps quiet, will your mind keep quiet too?   
Even in sleep the mind is busy with its dreams."

Amiatall Garu,   
There is no concept of empty mind in waking state according to me.   
I am sure not all bhagavan devotees are in agreement with me.   
Anyhow i suggest we leave all these *theory* discussions whether one can  
achieve empty mind or not but rather try to control our thoughts as suggested  
by bhagavan and bhagavad gita and kill our ego as far as possible.

Arunachala Ramana forum thrives only on "theory" discussions and this is  
evident on discussions.discussions and more discussions on Bhagavan's  
teachings. Bhagavan ramana has given very crystal clear instructions on mano  
nigraham and there is no need for any discussion on Bhagavan's teachings at  
all.His teachings are so simple to understand that great devotees like  
Annamalai Swami who was not highly educated could easily understand Bhagavan's  
teachings and could practice. **Bhagavan clearly says that if we do not  
practice atma vichara, mind will start doing ulaka vichara and hence we should  
not give room to the mind to do for ulaka vichara. All these endless  
discussions fall under ulaka vichara only.** He categorically told that if we  
practice atma vichara,then the mind will get its strength to stay in its  
source and mind will not stray thinking about past and future. **Bhagavan says  
that the conclusive evidence of all scriptures is that we have do control  
the mind and he asks us how can we do that by just reading endless  
books(also endless discussion) instead of practicing?All these discussions  
help only to strength our ego and do not help us to erase the ego.Hence if  
we have to erase the Ego, who have to turn our attention inwards known in  
tamil as SUMMS IRU.** **Are we?**

Dear Mr.Amiatall,   
 Thia is in response to reply no 8 posted by you.I am deeply attached to Bhagavan's teachings and i take his teaching as gold standard.His teachings are rational, free from rituals, applicable to people of different faiths, simple and is in line with sastras. As per Bhagavan, the root cause for all problem is Ego and he wants us to erase this ego and he has given simple method.He never asked anybody to stop working/stop earning money/stop having relationship.In fact when some of the house holders wanted to leave the family and serve the ashram, he never encouraged them to do so.. When some body wanted sit and do continuous meditation for hours together without doing any work he never encouraged that. In fact sastra itself says that we should earn our livelihood.What Bhagavan wants us is to get rid of the notion "I and Mine''.Once we do any work without that notion, then there is no role for the ego.You may recall the history wherein countries fought endless wars because of strong notion of I and Mine of individuals and examples are many such as Hitler, Mussolini,Japanese ruler,Sadham Husain etc.   
 **To get rid of of "I' notion also known as ahamkara, Bhagavan has given an unique method which we do not find even in sastras and that unique method is called self enquiry which is nothing but cutting I thought at its root when ever it props up. **Any body can do this practice since it is not restricted any to caste, community or profession.We can practice self enquiry while walking, sitting,, driving and even while one is brushing the teeth or while in rest room.While your attention is inwards, your external activities will not at all be affected.It will get affected only when self attention is lost.It is like this.When you are attending to some serious work, there wont be any thought about past or future and your full attention will be on the job and in this state, you are automatically going inwards and you are in meditation without yourself aware that you are in meditation. You will complete the job perfectly well without any mistake.However, if some thought props up while you are on the job, it means that thinker has come(I notion) since there cannot be a thought without thinker. Then your concentration in the job will be lost and you will make mistake in that job.   
 To your question on what will change after realization,the very fact that one is attracted to Bhagavan's teaching & attracted to Arunachala ramana forum means that at present he is unhappy and want happiness and peace. He will get happiness and peace when he sheds the"I and Mine" notion collectively called Ego. Bhagavan has given a practical method to erase the ego and to my knowledge no body has given such simple method and that is why Bhagavan's teachings are popular through out the world.. What will happen by turning attention inwards cannot be explained in words but has to be experienced by oneself.

In my above post there are some spelling mistakes. **PROPS UP** should be read  
as **POPS UP.The reason for spelling mistakes in my posts is primarily due  
to my poor eye sight due to Retina detachment and the other reason is that I  
am not proficient in english since my mother tongue is Tamil.Moreover I have  
studied in Tinnai Pallikoodam and i am not convent educated.Hope readers will  
pardon me for my mistakes.**

Quote from: amiatall on June 30, 2010, 11:41:37 AM  
Now, I ask: doing discussing how discussion is pointless;   
doing discussing of various teachings;   
doing "SUMA IRU".   
There can endless discussions on objects whereas what is there to discuss  
about SELF which is the nothing but state of BEING or SILENCE.Also we do  
not discuss the gospel of sages such as Sri.Ramakrishna,Swami Viekananda,  
Paramacharya of Kanchi, Jesus Christ and other sages since their teachings  
are revelations.What Bhagavan says is that we have to throw away the  
books(meaning stop reading) at certain stage and try to BE.

Amiatall Garu,   
Anyhow i suggest we leave all these *theory* discussions whether one can  
achieve empty mind or not but rather try to control our thoughts as suggested  
by bhagavan and bhagavad gita and kill our ego as far as possible.   
Arunachala Ramana forum thrives only on "theory" discussions and this is  
evident on discussions.discussions and more discussions on Bhagavan's  
teachings. Bhagavan ramana has given very crystal clear instructions on mano  
nigraham and there is no need for any discussion on Bhagavan's teachings at  
all.His teachings are so simple to understand that great devotees like  
Annamalai Swami who was not highly educated could easily understand Bhagavan's  
teachings and could practice. **Bhagavan clearly says that if we do not  
practice atma vichara, mind will start doing ulaka vichara and hence we should  
not give room to the mind to do for ulaka vichara. All these endless  
discussions fall under ulaka vichara only.** He categorically told that if we  
practice atma vichara,then the mind will get its strength to stay in its  
source and mind will not stray thinking about past and future. **Bhagavan says  
that the conclusive evidence of all scriptures is that we have do control  
the mind and he asks us how can we do that by just reading endless  
books(also endless discussion) instead of practicing?All these discussions  
help only to strength our ego and do not help us to erase the ego.Hence if  
we have to erase the Ego, who have to turn our attention inwards known in  
tamil as SUMMS IRU.** **Are we?**

Dear Mr.Amiatall,   
 Thia is in response to reply no 8 posted by you.I am deeply attached to Bhagavan's teachings and i take his teaching as gold standard.His teachings are rational, free from rituals, applicable to people of different faiths, simple and is in line with sastras. As per Bhagavan, the root cause for all problem is Ego and he wants us to erase this ego and he has given simple method.He never asked anybody to stop working/stop earning money/stop having relationship.In fact when some of the house holders wanted to leave the family and serve the ashram, he never encouraged them to do so.. When some body wanted sit and do continuous meditation for hours together without doing any work he never encouraged that. In fact sastra itself says that we should earn our livelihood.What Bhagavan wants us is to get rid of the notion "I and Mine''.Once we do any work without that notion, then there is no role for the ego.You may recall the history wherein countries fought endless wars because of strong notion of I and Mine of individuals and examples are many such as Hitler, Mussolini,Japanese ruler,Sadham Husain etc.   
 **To get rid of of "I' notion also known as ahamkara, Bhagavan has given an unique method which we do not find even in sastras and that unique method is called self enquiry which is nothing but cutting I thought at its root when ever it props up. **Any body can do this practice since it is not restricted any to caste, community or profession.We can practice self enquiry while walking, sitting,, driving and even while one is brushing the teeth or while in rest room.While your attention is inwards, your external activities will not at all be affected.It will get affected only when self attention is lost.It is like this.When you are attending to some serious work, there wont be any thought about past or future and your full attention will be on the job and in this state, you are automatically going inwards and you are in meditation without yourself aware that you are in meditation. You will complete the job perfectly well without any mistake.However, if some thought props up while you are on the job, it means that thinker has come(I notion) since there cannot be a thought without thinker. Then your concentration in the job will be lost and you will make mistake in that job.   
 To your question on what will change after realization,the very fact that one is attracted to Bhagavan's teaching & attracted to Arunachala ramana forum means that at present he is unhappy and want happiness and peace. He will get happiness and peace when he sheds the"I and Mine" notion collectively called Ego. Bhagavan has given a practical method to erase the ego and to my knowledge no body has given such simple method and that is why Bhagavan's teachings are popular through out the world.. What will happen by turning attention inwards cannot be explained in words but has to be experienced by oneself.

Now, I ask: doing discussing how discussion is pointless;   
doing discussing of various teachings;   
doing "SUMA IRU".   
There can endless discussions on objects whereas what is there to discuss  
about SELF which is the nothing but state of BEING or SILENCE.Also we do  
not discuss the gospel of sages such as Sri.Ramakrishna,Swami Viekananda,  
Paramacharya of Kanchi, Jesus Christ and other sages since their teachings  
are revelations.What Bhagavan says is that we have to throw away the  
books(meaning stop reading) at certain stage and try to BE.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Ten principles for the PEACE of MIND  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 28, 2010, 10:06:41 AM  
---  
**1\. Do Not Interfere In Others ' Business Unless Asked.  
Most of us create our own problems by interfering too often in others'  
affairs. We do so because somehow we have convinced ourselves that our way is  
the best way, our logic is the perfect logic and those who do not conform to  
our thinking must be criticized and steered to the right direction, our  
direction. This thinking denies the existence of individuality and  
consequently the existence of God.. God has created each one of us in a unique  
way. No two human beings can think or act in exactly the same way. All men or  
women act the way they do because God within them prompts them that way. Mind  
your own business and you will keep your peace.   
**2\. Forgive And Forget:**   
This is the most powerful aid to peace of mind. We often develop ill feelings  
inside our heart for the person who insults us or harms us. We nurture  
grievances. This in turn results in loss of sleep, development of stomach  
ulcers, and high blood pressure. This insult or injury was done once, but  
nourishing of grievance goes on forever by constantly remembering it. Get over  
this bad habit. Life is too short to waste in such trifles. Forgive,20Forget,  
and march on. Love flourishes in giving and forgiving.   
**3\. Do Not Crave For Recogniti  
DateTime: This world is full of selfish people. They seldom praise anybody without  
selfish motives. They may praise you today because you are in power, but no  
sooner than you are powerless, they will forget your achievement and will  
start finding faults in you. Why do you wish to kill yourse lf in striving for  
their recognition? Their recognition is not worth the aggravation. Do your  
duties ethically and sincerely.   
**4\. Do Not Be Jealous:**   
We all have experienced how jealousy can disturb our peace of mind. You know  
that you work harder than your colleagues in the office, but sometimes they  
get promotions; you do not. You started a business several years ago, but you  
are not as successful as your neighbor whose business is only one year old.  
There are several examples like these in everyday life. Should you be jealous?  
No. Remember everybody's life is shaped by his/her destiny, which has now  
become his/her reality. If you are destined to be rich, nothing in the world  
can stop you. If you are not so destined, no one can help you either. Nothing  
will be gained by blaming others for your misfortune. Jealousy will not get  
you anywhere; it will only take away your peace of mind.   
**5\. Change Yourself According To The Environment:**   
If you try to change the environment single-handedly, the chances are you will  
fail. Instead, change yourself to suit your environment. As you do this, even  
the environment, which has been unfriendly to you, will mysteriously change  
and seem congenial and harmonious.   
**6\. Endure What Cannot Be Cured:**   
This is the best way to turn a disadvantage into an advantage. Every day we  
face numerous inconveniences, ailments, irritations, and accidents that are  
beyond our control. If we cannot control them or change them, we must learn to  
put up with these things. We must learn to endure them cheerfully. Believe in  
yourself and you will gain in terms of patience, inner strength and will  
power.   
**7\. Do Not Bite Off More Than You Can Chew:**   
This maxim needs to be remembered constantly. We often tend to take more  
responsibilities than we are capable of carrying out. This is done to satisfy  
our ego. Know your limitations.. Why take on additional loads that may create  
more worries? You cannot gain peace of mind by expanding your external  
activities. Reduce your material engagements and spend time in prayer,  
introspection and meditation. This will reduce those thoughts in your mind  
that make you restless. Uncluttered mind will produce greater peace of mind.   
**8\. Meditate Regularly:**   
Meditation calms the mind and gets rid of disturbing thoughts. This is the  
highest state of peace of mind. Try and experience it yourself. If you  
meditate earnestly for half an hour everyday, your mind will tend to become  
peaceful during the remaining twenty-three and half-hours. Your mind will not  
be easily disturbed as it was before. You would benefit by gradually  
increasing the period of daily meditation. You may think that this will  
interfere with your daily work. On the contrary, this will increase your  
efficiency and you will be able to produce better results in less time.   
**9\. Never Leave The Mind Vacant:**   
An empty mind is the devil's workshop. All evil actions start in the vacant  
mind. Keep your mind occupied in something positive, something worthwhile.  
Actively follow a hobby. Do something that holds your interest. You must  
decide what you value more: money or peace of mind. Your hobby, like social  
work or religious work, may not always earn you more money, but you will have  
a sense of fulfillment and achievement. Even when you are resting physically,  
occupy yourself in healthy reading or mental chanting of God's name.   
**10\. Do Not Procrastinate And Never Regret:**   
Do not waste time in protracted wondering " Should I or shouldn't I?" Days,  
weeks, months, and years may be wasted in that futile mental debating. You can  
never plan enough because you can never anticipate all future happenings.  
Value your time and do the things that need to be done. It does not matter if  
you fail the first time. You can learn from your mistakes and succeed the next  
time. Sitting back and worrying will lead to nothing. Learn from your  
mistakes, but do not brood over the past. DO NOT REGRET. Whatever happened was  
destined to happen only that way. Why cry over spilt milk?

Mind can never be kept empty. The best way, in my view, is to   
keep it engaged in sattvic work, like gardening, telling beads, or   
some non-profit social work like teaching children, learning simple   
new arts like singing Bhagavan Ramana's poems in a low tone and   
enjoying the contents and the music. When one goes to bed, before   
you get into deep sleep, chant some holy names.   
Arunachala Siva.

well said Subramanian garu.   
Once there was discussion between Varanasi Subbalakshmi garu and bhagavan and  
it goes like this   
Quote  
V S : "What have I got except endless work in the kitchen?" Bhagavan said  
with deep feeling: B: "Your hands may do the work but your mind can remain still.   
You are that which never move Realize that and you will find that work is not  
a strain.   
But as long as you think that you are the body and that the work is done by  
you,you will feel your life to be an endless toil.   
In fact, it is the mind that toils, not the body.   
Even if your body keeps quiet, will your mind keep quiet too?   
Even in sleep the mind is busy with its dreams."

Amiatall Garu,   
There is no concept of empty mind in waking state according to me.   
I am sure not all bhagavan devotees are in agreement with me.   
Anyhow i suggest we leave all these *theory* discussions whether one can  
achieve empty mind or not but rather try to control our thoughts as suggested  
by bhagavan and bhagavad gita and kill our ego as far as possible.

become his/her reality. If you are destined to be rich, nothing in the world  
can stop you. If you are not so destined, no one can help you either. Nothing  
will be gained by blaming others for your misfortune. Jealousy will not get  
you anywhere; it will only take away your peace of mind.   
**5\. Change Yourself According To The Environment:**   
If you try to change the environment single-handedly, the chances are you will  
fail. Instead, change yourself to suit your environment. As you do this, even  
the environment, which has been unfriendly to you, will mysteriously change  
and seem congenial and harmonious.   
**6\. Endure What Cannot Be Cured:**   
This is the best way to turn a disadvantage into an advantage. Every day we  
face numerous inconveniences, ailments, irritations, and accidents that are  
beyond our control. If we cannot control them or change them, we must learn to  
put up with these things. We must learn to endure them cheerfully. Believe in  
yourself and you will gain in terms of patience, inner strength and will  
power.   
**7\. Do Not Bite Off More Than You Can Chew:**   
This maxim needs to be remembered constantly. We often tend to take more  
responsibilities than we are capable of carrying out. This is done to satisfy  
our ego. Know your limitations.. Why take on additional loads that may create  
more worries? You cannot gain peace of mind by expanding your external  
activities. Reduce your material engagements and spend time in prayer,  
introspection and meditation. This will reduce those thoughts in your mind  
that make you restless. Uncluttered mind will produce greater peace of mind.   
**8\. Meditate Regularly:**   
Meditation calms the mind and gets rid of disturbing thoughts. This is the  
highest state of peace of mind. Try and experience it yourself. If you  
meditate earnestly for half an hour everyday, your mind will tend to become  
peaceful during the remaining twenty-three and half-hours. Your mind will not  
be easily disturbed as it was before. You would benefit by gradually  
increasing the period of daily meditation. You may think that this will  
interfere with your daily work. On the contrary, this will increase your  
efficiency and you will be able to produce better results in less time.   
**9\. Never Leave The Mind Vacant:**   
An empty mind is the devil's workshop. All evil actions start in the vacant  
mind. Keep your mind occupied in something positive, something worthwhile.  
Actively follow a hobby. Do something that holds your interest. You must  
decide what you value more: money or peace of mind. Your hobby, like social  
work or religious work, may not always earn you more money, but you will have  
a sense of fulfillment and achievement. Even when you are resting physically,  
occupy yourself in healthy reading or mental chanting of God's name.   
**10\. Do Not Procrastinate And Never Regret:**   
Do not waste time in protracted wondering " Should I or shouldn't I?" Days,  
weeks, months, and years may be wasted in that futile mental debating. You can  
never plan enough because you can never anticipate all future happenings.  
Value your time and do the things that need to be done. It does not matter if  
you fail the first time. You can learn from your mistakes and succeed the next  
time. Sitting back and worrying will lead to nothing. Learn from your  
mistakes, but do not brood over the past. DO NOT REGRET. Whatever happened was  
destined to happen only that way. Why cry over spilt milk?

Mind can never be kept empty. The best way, in my view, is to   
keep it engaged in sattvic work, like gardening, telling beads, or   
some non-profit social work like teaching children, learning simple   
new arts like singing Bhagavan Ramana's poems in a low tone and   
enjoying the contents and the music. When one goes to bed, before   
you get into deep sleep, chant some holy names.   
Arunachala Siva.

well said Subramanian garu.   
Once there was discussion between Varanasi Subbalakshmi garu and bhagavan and  
it goes like this   
Quote  
V S : "What have I got except endless work in the kitchen?" Bhagavan said  
with deep feeling: B: "Your hands may do the work but your mind can remain still.   
You are that which never move Realize that and you will find that work is not  
a strain.   
But as long as you think that you are the body and that the work is done by  
you,you will feel your life to be an endless toil.   
In fact, it is the mind that toils, not the body.   
Even if your body keeps quiet, will your mind keep quiet too?   
Even in sleep the mind is busy with its dreams."

Amiatall Garu,   
There is no concept of empty mind in waking state according to me.   
I am sure not all bhagavan devotees are in agreement with me.   
Anyhow i suggest we leave all these *theory* discussions whether one can  
achieve empty mind or not but rather try to control our thoughts as suggested  
by bhagavan and bhagavad gita and kill our ego as far as possible.

Arunachala Ramana forum thrives only on "theory" discussions and this is  
evident on discussions.discussions and more discussions on Bhagavan's  
teachings. Bhagavan ramana has given very crystal clear instructions on mano  
nigraham and there is no need for any discussion on Bhagavan's teachings at  
all.His teachings are so simple to understand that great devotees like  
Annamalai Swami who was not highly educated could easily understand Bhagavan's  
teachings and could practice. **Bhagavan clearly says that if we do not  
practice atma vichara, mind will start doing ulaka vichara and hence we should  
not give room to the mind to do for ulaka vichara. All these endless  
discussions fall under ulaka vichara only.** He categorically told that if we  
practice atma vichara,then the mind will get its strength to stay in its  
source and mind will not stray thinking about past and future. **Bhagavan says  
that the conclusive evidence of all scriptures is that we have do control  
the mind and he asks us how can we do that by just reading endless  
books(also endless discussion) instead of practicing?All these discussions  
help only to strength our ego and do not help us to erase the ego.Hence if  
we have to erase the Ego, who have to turn our attention inwards known in  
tamil as SUMMS IRU.** **Are we?**

Dear Mr.Amiatall,   
 Thia is in response to reply no 8 posted by you.I am deeply attached to Bhagavan's teachings and i take his teaching as gold standard.His teachings are rational, free from rituals, applicable to people of different faiths, simple and is in line with sastras. As per Bhagavan, the root cause for all problem is Ego and he wants us to erase this ego and he has given simple method.He never asked anybody to stop working/stop earning money/stop having relationship.In fact when some of the house holders wanted to leave the family and serve the ashram, he never encouraged them to do so.. When some body wanted sit and do continuous meditation for hours together without doing any work he never encouraged that. In fact sastra itself says that we should earn our livelihood.What Bhagavan wants us is to get rid of the notion "I and Mine''.Once we do any work without that notion, then there is no role for the ego.You may recall the history wherein countries fought endless wars because of strong notion of I and Mine of individuals and examples are many such as Hitler, Mussolini,Japanese ruler,Sadham Husain etc.   
 **To get rid of of "I' notion also known as ahamkara, Bhagavan has given an unique method which we do not find even in sastras and that unique method is called self enquiry which is nothing but cutting I thought at its root when ever it props up. **Any body can do this practice since it is not restricted any to caste, community or profession.We can practice self enquiry while walking, sitting,, driving and even while one is brushing the teeth or while in rest room.While your attention is inwards, your external activities will not at all be affected.It will get affected only when self attention is lost.It is like this.When you are attending to some serious work, there wont be any thought about past or future and your full attention will be on the job and in this state, you are automatically going inwards and you are in meditation without yourself aware that you are in meditation. You will complete the job perfectly well without any mistake.However, if some thought props up while you are on the job, it means that thinker has come(I notion) since there cannot be a thought without thinker. Then your concentration in the job will be lost and you will make mistake in that job.   
 To your question on what will change after realization,the very fact that one is attracted to Bhagavan's teaching & attracted to Arunachala ramana forum means that at present he is unhappy and want happiness and peace. He will get happiness and peace when he sheds the"I and Mine" notion collectively called Ego. Bhagavan has given a practical method to erase the ego and to my knowledge no body has given such simple method and that is why Bhagavan's teachings are popular through out the world.. What will happen by turning attention inwards cannot be explained in words but has to be experienced by oneself.

In my above post there are some spelling mistakes. **PROPS UP** should be read  
as **POPS UP.The reason for spelling mistakes in my posts is primarily due  
to my poor eye sight due to Retina detachment and the other reason is that I  
am not proficient in english since my mother tongue is Tamil.Moreover I have  
studied in Tinnai Pallikoodam and i am not convent educated.Hope readers will

Now, I ask: doing discussing how discussion is pointless;   
doing discussing of various teachings;   
doing "SUMA IRU".   
There can endless discussions on objects whereas what is there to discuss  
about SELF which is the nothing but state of BEING or SILENCE.Also we do  
not discuss the gospel of sages such as Sri.Ramakrishna,Swami Viekananda,  
Paramacharya of Kanchi, Jesus Christ and other sages since their teachings  
are revelations.What Bhagavan says is that we have to throw away the  
books(meaning stop reading) at certain stage and try to BE.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Ten principles for the PEACE of MIND  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 28, 2010, 10:06:41 AM  
---  
**1\. Do Not Interfere In Others ' Business Unless Asked.  
Most of us create our own problems by interfering too often in others'  
affairs. We do so because somehow we have convinced ourselves that our way is  
the best way, our logic is the perfect logic and those who do not conform to  
our thinking must be criticized and steered to the right direction, our  
direction. This thinking denies the existence of individuality and  
consequently the existence of God.. God has created each one of us in a unique  
way. No two human beings can think or act in exactly the same way. All men or  
women act the way they do because God within them prompts them that way. Mind  
your own business and you will keep your peace.   
**2\. Forgive And Forget:**   
This is the most powerful aid to peace of mind. We often develop ill feelings  
inside our heart for the person who insults us or harms us. We nurture  
grievances. This in turn results in loss of sleep, development of stomach  
ulcers, and high blood pressure. This insult or injury was done once, but  
nourishing of grievance goes on forever by constantly remembering it. Get over  
this bad habit. Life is too short to waste in such trifles. Forgive,20Forget,  
and march on. Love flourishes in giving and forgiving.   
**3\. Do Not Crave For Recogniti  
DateTime: This world is full of selfish people. They seldom praise anybody without  
selfish motives. They may praise you today because you are in power, but no  
sooner than you are powerless, they will forget your achievement and will  
start finding faults in you. Why do you wish to kill yourse lf in striving for  
their recognition? Their recognition is not worth the aggravation. Do your  
duties ethically and sincerely.   
**4\. Do Not Be Jealous:**   
We all have experienced how jealousy can disturb our peace of mind. You know  
that you work harder than your colleagues in the office, but sometimes they  
get promotions; you do not. You started a business several years ago, but you  
are not as successful as your neighbor whose business is only one year old.  
There are several examples like these in everyday life. Should you be jealous?  
No. Remember everybody's life is shaped by his/her destiny, which has now  
become his/her reality. If you are destined to be rich, nothing in the world  
can stop you. If you are not so destined, no one can help you either. Nothing  
will be gained by blaming others for your misfortune. Jealousy will not get  
you anywhere; it will only take away your peace of mind.   
**5\. Change Yourself According To The Environment:**   
If you try to change the environment single-handedly, the chances are you will  
fail. Instead, change yourself to suit your environment. As you do this, even  
the environment, which has been unfriendly to you, will mysteriously change  
and seem congenial and harmonious.   
**6\. Endure What Cannot Be Cured:**   
This is the best way to turn a disadvantage into an advantage. Every day we  
face numerous inconveniences, ailments, irritations, and accidents that are  
beyond our control. If we cannot control them or change them, we must learn to  
put up with these things. We must learn to endure them cheerfully. Believe in  
yourself and you will gain in terms of patience, inner strength and will  
power.   
**7\. Do Not Bite Off More Than You Can Chew:**   
This maxim needs to be remembered constantly. We often tend to take more  
responsibilities than we are capable of carrying out. This is done to satisfy  
our ego. Know your limitations.. Why take on additional loads that may create  
more worries? You cannot gain peace of mind by expanding your external  
activities. Reduce your material engagements and spend time in prayer,

Dear Mr.Amiatall,   
 Thia is in response to reply no 8 posted by you.I am deeply attached to Bhagavan's teachings and i take his teaching as gold standard.His teachings are rational, free from rituals, applicable to people of different faiths, simple and is in line with sastras. As per Bhagavan, the root cause for all problem is Ego and he wants us to erase this ego and he has given simple method.He never asked anybody to stop working/stop earning money/stop having relationship.In fact when some of the house holders wanted to leave the family and serve the ashram, he never encouraged them to do so.. When some body wanted sit and do continuous meditation for hours together without doing any work he never encouraged that. In fact sastra itself says that we should earn our livelihood.What Bhagavan wants us is to get rid of the notion "I and Mine''.Once we do any work without that notion, then there is no role for the ego.You may recall the history wherein countries fought endless wars because of strong notion of I and Mine of individuals and examples are many such as Hitler, Mussolini,Japanese ruler,Sadham Husain etc.   
 **To get rid of of "I' notion also known as ahamkara, Bhagavan has given an unique method which we do not find even in sastras and that unique method is called self enquiry which is nothing but cutting I thought at its root when ever it props up. **Any body can do this practice since it is not restricted any to caste, community or profession.We can practice self enquiry while walking, sitting,, driving and even while one is brushing the teeth or while in rest room.While your attention is inwards, your external activities will not at all be affected.It will get affected only when self attention is lost.It is like this.When you are attending to some serious work, there wont be any thought about past or future and your full attention will be on the job and in this state, you are automatically going inwards and you are in meditation without yourself aware that you are in meditation. You will complete the job perfectly well without any mistake.However, if some thought props up while you are on the job, it means that thinker has come(I notion) since there cannot be a thought without thinker. Then your concentration in the job will be lost and you will make mistake in that job.   
 To your question on what will change after realization,the very fact that one is attracted to Bhagavan's teaching & attracted to Arunachala ramana forum means that at present he is unhappy and want happiness and peace. He will get happiness and peace when he sheds the"I and Mine" notion collectively called Ego. Bhagavan has given a practical method to erase the ego and to my knowledge no body has given such simple method and that is why Bhagavan's teachings are popular through out the world.. What will happen by turning attention inwards cannot be explained in words but has to be experienced by oneself.

Now, I ask: doing discussing how discussion is pointless;   
doing discussing of various teachings;   
doing "SUMA IRU".   
There can endless discussions on objects whereas what is there to discuss  
about SELF which is the nothing but state of BEING or SILENCE.Also we do  
not discuss the gospel of sages such as Sri.Ramakrishna,Swami Viekananda,  
Paramacharya of Kanchi, Jesus Christ and other sages since their teachings  
are revelations.What Bhagavan says is that we have to throw away the  
books(meaning stop reading) at certain stage and try to BE.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Ten principles for the PEACE of MIND  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 28, 2010, 10:06:41 AM  
---  
**1\. Do Not Interfere In Others ' Business Unless Asked.  
Most of us create our own problems by interfering too often in others'  
affairs. We do so because somehow we have convinced ourselves that our way is  
the best way, our logic is the perfect logic and those who do not conform to  
our thinking must be criticized and steered to the right direction, our  
direction. This thinking denies the existence of individuality and  
consequently the existence of God.. God has created each one of us in a unique  
way. No two human beings can think or act in exactly the same way. All men or  
women act the way they do because God within them prompts them that way. Mind  
your own business and you will keep your peace.   
**2\. Forgive And Forget:**   
This is the most powerful aid to peace of mind. We often develop ill feelings  
inside our heart for the person who insults us or harms us. We nurture  
grievances. This in turn results in loss of sleep, development of stomach  
ulcers, and high blood pressure. This insult or injury was done once, but  
nourishing of grievance goes on forever by constantly remembering it. Get over  
this bad habit. Life is too short to waste in such trifles. Forgive,20Forget,  
and march on. Love flourishes in giving and forgiving.   
**3\. Do Not Crave For Recogniti  
DateTime: This world is full of selfish people. They seldom praise anybody without  
selfish motives. They may praise you today because you are in power, but no  
sooner than you are powerless, they will forget your achievement and will  
start finding faults in you. Why do you wish to kill yourse lf in striving for  
their recognition? Their recognition is not worth the aggravation. Do your  
duties ethically and sincerely.   
**4\. Do Not Be Jealous:**   
We all have experienced how jealousy can disturb our peace of mind. You know  
that you work harder than your colleagues in the office, but sometimes they  
get promotions; you do not. You started a business several years ago, but you  
are not as successful as your neighbor whose business is only one year old.  
There are several examples like these in everyday life. Should you be jealous?  
No. Remember everybody's life is shaped by his/her destiny, which has now  
become his/her reality. If you are destined to be rich, nothing in the world  
can stop you. If you are not so destined, no one can help you either. Nothing  
will be gained by blaming others for your misfortune. Jealousy will not get  
you anywhere; it will only take away your peace of mind.   
**5\. Change Yourself According To The Environment:**   
If you try to change the environment single-handedly, the chances are you will  
fail. Instead, change yourself to suit your environment. As you do this, even  
the environment, which has been unfriendly to you, will mysteriously change  
and seem congenial and harmonious.   
**6\. Endure What Cannot Be Cured:**   
This is the best way to turn a disadvantage into an advantage. Every day we  
face numerous inconveniences, ailments, irritations, and accidents that are  
beyond our control. If we cannot control them or change them, we must learn to  
put up with these things. We must learn to endure them cheerfully. Believe in  
yourself and you will gain in terms of patience, inner strength and will  
power.   
**7\. Do Not Bite Off More Than You Can Chew:**   
This maxim needs to be remembered constantly. We often tend to take more  
responsibilities than we are capable of carrying out. This is done to satisfy  
our ego. Know your limitations.. Why take on additional loads that may create  
more worries? You cannot gain peace of mind by expanding your external  
activities. Reduce your material engagements and spend time in prayer,  
introspection and meditation. This will reduce those thoughts in your mind  
that make you restless. Uncluttered mind will produce greater peace of mind.   
**8\. Meditate Regularly:**   
Meditation calms the mind and gets rid of disturbing thoughts. This is the  
highest state of peace of mind. Try and experience it yourself. If you  
meditate earnestly for half an hour everyday, your mind will tend to become  
peaceful during the remaining twenty-three and half-hours. Your mind will not  
be easily disturbed as it was before. You would benefit by gradually  
increasing the period of daily meditation. You may think that this will  
interfere with your daily work. On the contrary, this will increase your  
efficiency and you will be able to produce better results in less time.   
**9\. Never Leave The Mind Vacant:**   
An empty mind is the devil's workshop. All evil actions start in the vacant  
mind. Keep your mind occupied in something positive, something worthwhile.  
Actively follow a hobby. Do something that holds your interest. You must  
decide what you value more: money or peace of mind. Your hobby, like social  
work or religious work, may not always earn you more money, but you will have  
a sense of fulfillment and achievement. Even when you are resting physically,  
occupy yourself in healthy reading or mental chanting of God's name.   
**10\. Do Not Procrastinate And Never Regret:**   
Do not waste time in protracted wondering " Should I or shouldn't I?" Days,  
weeks, months, and years may be wasted in that futile mental debating. You can  
never plan enough because you can never anticipate all future happenings.  
Value your time and do the things that need to be done. It does not matter if  
you fail the first time. You can learn from your mistakes and succeed the next  
time. Sitting back and worrying will lead to nothing. Learn from your  
mistakes, but do not brood over the past. DO NOT REGRET. Whatever happened was  
destined to happen only that way. Why cry over spilt milk?

Mind can never be kept empty. The best way, in my view, is to   
keep it engaged in sattvic work, like gardening, telling beads, or   
some non-profit social work like teaching children, learning simple   
new arts like singing Bhagavan Ramana's poems in a low tone and   
enjoying the contents and the music. When one goes to bed, before   
you get into deep sleep, chant some holy names.   
Arunachala Siva.

well said Subramanian garu.   
Once there was discussion between Varanasi Subbalakshmi garu and bhagavan and  
it goes like this   
Quote  
V S : "What have I got except endless work in the kitchen?" Bhagavan said  
with deep feeling: B: "Your hands may do the work but your mind can remain still.   
You are that which never move Realize that and you will find that work is not  
a strain.   
But as long as you think that you are the body and that the work is done by  
you,you will feel your life to be an endless toil.   
In fact, it is the mind that toils, not the body.   
Even if your body keeps quiet, will your mind keep quiet too?   
Even in sleep the mind is busy with its dreams."

Amiatall Garu,   
There is no concept of empty mind in waking state according to me.   
I am sure not all bhagavan devotees are in agreement with me.   
Anyhow i suggest we leave all these *theory* discussions whether one can  
achieve empty mind or not but rather try to control our thoughts as suggested  
by bhagavan and bhagavad gita and kill our ego as far as possible.

by bhagavan and bhagavad gita and kill our ego as far as possible.   
Arunachala Ramana forum thrives only on "theory" discussions and this is  
evident on discussions.discussions and more discussions on Bhagavan's  
teachings. Bhagavan ramana has given very crystal clear instructions on mano  
nigraham and there is no need for any discussion on Bhagavan's teachings at  
all.His teachings are so simple to understand that great devotees like  
Annamalai Swami who was not highly educated could easily understand Bhagavan's  
teachings and could practice. **Bhagavan clearly says that if we do not  
practice atma vichara, mind will start doing ulaka vichara and hence we should  
not give room to the mind to do for ulaka vichara. All these endless  
discussions fall under ulaka vichara only.** He categorically told that if we  
practice atma vichara,then the mind will get its strength to stay in its  
source and mind will not stray thinking about past and future. **Bhagavan says  
that the conclusive evidence of all scriptures is that we have do control  
the mind and he asks us how can we do that by just reading endless  
books(also endless discussion) instead of practicing?All these discussions  
help only to strength our ego and do not help us to erase the ego.Hence if  
we have to erase the Ego, who have to turn our attention inwards known in  
tamil as SUMMS IRU.** **Are we?**

a sense of fulfillment and achievement. Even when you are resting physically,  
occupy yourself in healthy reading or mental chanting of God's name.   
**10\. Do Not Procrastinate And Never Regret:**   
Do not waste time in protracted wondering " Should I or shouldn't I?" Days,  
weeks, months, and years may be wasted in that futile mental debating. You can  
never plan enough because you can never anticipate all future happenings.  
Value your time and do the things that need to be done. It does not matter if  
you fail the first time. You can learn from your mistakes and succeed the next  
time. Sitting back and worrying will lead to nothing. Learn from your  
mistakes, but do not brood over the past. DO NOT REGRET. Whatever happened was  
destined to happen only that way. Why cry over spilt milk?

Mind can never be kept empty. The best way, in my view, is to   
keep it engaged in sattvic work, like gardening, telling beads, or   
some non-profit social work like teaching children, learning simple   
new arts like singing Bhagavan Ramana's poems in a low tone and   
enjoying the contents and the music. When one goes to bed, before   
you get into deep sleep, chant some holy names.   
Arunachala Siva.

well said Subramanian garu.   
Once there was discussion between Varanasi Subbalakshmi garu and bhagavan and  
it goes like this   
Quote  
V S : "What have I got except endless work in the kitchen?" Bhagavan said  
with deep feeling: B: "Your hands may do the work but your mind can remain still.   
You are that which never move Realize that and you will find that work is not  
a strain.   
But as long as you think that you are the body and that the work is done by  
you,you will feel your life to be an endless toil.   
In fact, it is the mind that toils, not the body.   
Even if your body keeps quiet, will your mind keep quiet too?   
Even in sleep the mind is busy with its dreams."

Amiatall Garu,   
There is no concept of empty mind in waking state according to me.   
I am sure not all bhagavan devotees are in agreement with me.   
Anyhow i suggest we leave all these *theory* discussions whether one can  
achieve empty mind or not but rather try to control our thoughts as suggested  
by bhagavan and bhagavad gita and kill our ego as far as possible.

Arunachala Ramana forum thrives only on "theory" discussions and this is  
evident on discussions.discussions and more discussions on Bhagavan's  
teachings. Bhagavan ramana has given very crystal clear instructions on mano  
nigraham and there is no need for any discussion on Bhagavan's teachings at  
all.His teachings are so simple to understand that great devotees like  
Annamalai Swami who was not highly educated could easily understand Bhagavan's  
teachings and could practice. **Bhagavan clearly says that if we do not  
practice atma vichara, mind will start doing ulaka vichara and hence we should  
not give room to the mind to do for ulaka vichara. All these endless  
discussions fall under ulaka vichara only.** He categorically told that if we  
practice atma vichara,then the mind will get its strength to stay in its  
source and mind will not stray thinking about past and future. **Bhagavan says  
that the conclusive evidence of all scriptures is that we have do control  
the mind and he asks us how can we do that by just reading endless  
books(also endless discussion) instead of practicing?All these discussions  
help only to strength our ego and do not help us to erase the ego.Hence if  
we have to erase the Ego, who have to turn our attention inwards known in  
tamil as SUMMS IRU.** **Are we?**

Dear Mr.Amiatall,   
 Thia is in response to reply no 8 posted by you.I am deeply attached to Bhagavan's teachings and i take his teaching as gold standard.His teachings are rational, free from rituals, applicable to people of different faiths, simple and is in line with sastras. As per Bhagavan, the root cause for all problem is Ego and he wants us to erase this ego and he has given simple method.He never asked anybody to stop working/stop earning money/stop having relationship.In fact when some of the house holders wanted to leave the family and serve the ashram, he never encouraged them to do so.. When some body wanted sit and do continuous meditation for hours together without doing any work he never encouraged that. In fact sastra itself says that we should earn our livelihood.What Bhagavan wants us is to get rid of the notion "I and Mine''.Once we do any work without that notion, then there is no role for the ego.You may recall the history wherein countries fought endless wars because of strong notion of I and Mine of individuals and examples are many such as Hitler, Mussolini,Japanese ruler,Sadham Husain etc.   
 **To get rid of of "I' notion also known as ahamkara, Bhagavan has given an unique method which we do not find even in sastras and that unique method is called self enquiry which is nothing but cutting I thought at its root when ever it props up. **Any body can do this practice since it is not restricted any to caste, community or profession.We can practice self enquiry while walking, sitting,, driving and even while one is brushing the teeth or while in rest room.While your attention is inwards, your external activities will not at all be affected.It will get affected only when self attention is lost.It is like this.When you are attending to some serious work, there wont be any thought about past or future and your full attention will be on the job and in this state, you are automatically going inwards and you are in meditation without yourself aware that you are in meditation. You will complete the job perfectly well without any mistake.However, if some thought props up while you are on the job, it means that thinker has come(I notion) since there cannot be a thought without thinker. Then your concentration in the job will be lost and you will make mistake in that job.   
 To your question on what will change after realization,the very fact that one is attracted to Bhagavan's teaching & attracted to Arunachala ramana forum means that at present he is unhappy and want happiness and peace. He will get happiness and peace when he sheds the"I and Mine" notion collectively called Ego. Bhagavan has given a practical method to erase the ego and to my knowledge no body has given such simple method and that is why Bhagavan's teachings are popular through out the world.. What will happen by turning attention inwards cannot be explained in words but has to be experienced by oneself.

In my above post there are some spelling mistakes. **PROPS UP** should be read  
as **POPS UP.The reason for spelling mistakes in my posts is primarily due  
to my poor eye sight due to Retina detachment and the other reason is that I

Now, I ask: doing discussing how discussion is pointless;   
doing discussing of various teachings;   
doing "SUMA IRU".   
There can endless discussions on objects whereas what is there to discuss  
about SELF which is the nothing but state of BEING or SILENCE.Also we do  
not discuss the gospel of sages such as Sri.Ramakrishna,Swami Viekananda,  
Paramacharya of Kanchi, Jesus Christ and other sages since their teachings  
are revelations.What Bhagavan says is that we have to throw away the  
books(meaning stop reading) at certain stage and try to BE.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Ten principles for the PEACE of MIND  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 28, 2010, 10:06:41 AM  
---  
**1\. Do Not Interfere In Others ' Business Unless Asked.  
Most of us create our own problems by interfering too often in others'  
affairs. We do so because somehow we have convinced ourselves that our way is  
the best way, our logic is the perfect logic and those who do not conform to  
our thinking must be criticized and steered to the right direction, our  
direction. This thinking denies the existence of individuality and  
consequently the existence of God.. God has created each one of us in a unique  
way. No two human beings can think or act in exactly the same way. All men or  
women act the way they do because God within them prompts them that way. Mind  
your own business and you will keep your peace.   
**2\. Forgive And Forget:**   
This is the most powerful aid to peace of mind. We often develop ill feelings  
inside our heart for the person who insults us or harms us. We nurture  
grievances. This in turn results in loss of sleep, development of stomach  
ulcers, and high blood pressure. This insult or injury was done once, but  
nourishing of grievance goes on forever by constantly remembering it. Get over  
this bad habit. Life is too short to waste in such trifles. Forgive,20Forget,  
and march on. Love flourishes in giving and forgiving.   
**3\. Do Not Crave For Recogniti  
DateTime: This world is full of selfish people. They seldom praise anybody without  
selfish motives. They may praise you today because you are in power, but no  
sooner than you are powerless, they will forget your achievement and will  
start finding faults in you. Why do you wish to kill yourse lf in striving for  
their recognition? Their recognition is not worth the aggravation. Do your  
duties ethically and sincerely.   
**4\. Do Not Be Jealous:**   
We all have experienced how jealousy can disturb our peace of mind. You know  
that you work harder than your colleagues in the office, but sometimes they  
get promotions; you do not. You started a business several years ago, but you  
are not as successful as your neighbor whose business is only one year old.  
There are several examples like these in everyday life. Should you be jealous?  
No. Remember everybody's life is shaped by his/her destiny, which has now  
become his/her reality. If you are destined to be rich, nothing in the world  
can stop you. If you are not so destined, no one can help you either. Nothing  
will be gained by blaming others for your misfortune. Jealousy will not get  
you anywhere; it will only take away your peace of mind.   
**5\. Change Yourself According To The Environment:**   
If you try to change the environment single-handedly, the chances are you will  
fail. Instead, change yourself to suit your environment. As you do this, even  
the environment, which has been unfriendly to you, will mysteriously change  
and seem congenial and harmonious.   
**6\. Endure What Cannot Be Cured:**   
This is the best way to turn a disadvantage into an advantage. Every day we  
face numerous inconveniences, ailments, irritations, and accidents that are  
beyond our control. If we cannot control them or change them, we must learn to  
put up with these things. We must learn to endure them cheerfully. Believe in  
yourself and you will gain in terms of patience, inner strength and will  
power.   
**7\. Do Not Bite Off More Than You Can Chew:**   
This maxim needs to be remembered constantly. We often tend to take more  
responsibilities than we are capable of carrying out. This is done to satisfy  
our ego. Know your limitations.. Why take on additional loads that may create  
more worries? You cannot gain peace of mind by expanding your external  
activities. Reduce your material engagements and spend time in prayer,  
introspection and meditation. This will reduce those thoughts in your mind  
that make you restless. Uncluttered mind will produce greater peace of mind.   
**8\. Meditate Regularly:**   
Meditation calms the mind and gets rid of disturbing thoughts. This is the  
highest state of peace of mind. Try and experience it yourself. If you  
meditate earnestly for half an hour everyday, your mind will tend to become  
peaceful during the remaining twenty-three and half-hours. Your mind will not  
be easily disturbed as it was before. You would benefit by gradually  
increasing the period of daily meditation. You may think that this will  
interfere with your daily work. On the contrary, this will increase your  
efficiency and you will be able to produce better results in less time.   
**9\. Never Leave The Mind Vacant:**   
An empty mind is the devil's workshop. All evil actions start in the vacant  
mind. Keep your mind occupied in something positive, something worthwhile.  
Actively follow a hobby. Do something that holds your interest. You must  
decide what you value more: money or peace of mind. Your hobby, like social  
work or religious work, may not always earn you more money, but you will have  
a sense of fulfillment and achievement. Even when you are resting physically,  
occupy yourself in healthy reading or mental chanting of God's name.   
**10\. Do Not Procrastinate And Never Regret:**   
Do not waste time in protracted wondering " Should I or shouldn't I?" Days,  
weeks, months, and years may be wasted in that futile mental debating. You can  
never plan enough because you can never anticipate all future happenings.  
Value your time and do the things that need to be done. It does not matter if  
you fail the first time. You can learn from your mistakes and succeed the next  
time. Sitting back and worrying will lead to nothing. Learn from your  
mistakes, but do not brood over the past. DO NOT REGRET. Whatever happened was  
destined to happen only that way. Why cry over spilt milk?

Now, I ask: doing discussing how discussion is pointless;   
doing discussing of various teachings;   
doing "SUMA IRU".   
There can endless discussions on objects whereas what is there to discuss  
about SELF which is the nothing but state of BEING or SILENCE.Also we do  
not discuss the gospel of sages such as Sri.Ramakrishna,Swami Viekananda,  
Paramacharya of Kanchi, Jesus Christ and other sages since their teachings  
are revelations.What Bhagavan says is that we have to throw away the  
books(meaning stop reading) at certain stage and try to BE.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Ten principles for the PEACE of MIND  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 28, 2010, 10:06:41 AM  
---  
**1\. Do Not Interfere In Others ' Business Unless Asked.  
Most of us create our own problems by interfering too often in others'  
affairs. We do so because somehow we have convinced ourselves that our way is  
the best way, our logic is the perfect logic and those who do not conform to  
our thinking must be criticized and steered to the right direction, our  
direction. This thinking denies the existence of individuality and  
consequently the existence of God.. God has created each one of us in a unique  
way. No two human beings can think or act in exactly the same way. All men or  
women act the way they do because God within them prompts them that way. Mind  
your own business and you will keep your peace.   
**2\. Forgive And Forget:**   
This is the most powerful aid to peace of mind. We often develop ill feelings  
inside our heart for the person who insults us or harms us. We nurture  
grievances. This in turn results in loss of sleep, development of stomach  
ulcers, and high blood pressure. This insult or injury was done once, but  
nourishing of grievance goes on forever by constantly remembering it. Get over  
this bad habit. Life is too short to waste in such trifles. Forgive,20Forget,  
and march on. Love flourishes in giving and forgiving.   
**3\. Do Not Crave For Recogniti  
DateTime: This world is full of selfish people. They seldom praise anybody without  
selfish motives. They may praise you today because you are in power, but no  
sooner than you are powerless, they will forget your achievement and will  
start finding faults in you. Why do you wish to kill yourse lf in striving for  
their recognition? Their recognition is not worth the aggravation. Do your  
duties ethically and sincerely.   
**4\. Do Not Be Jealous:**   
We all have experienced how jealousy can disturb our peace of mind. You know  
that you work harder than your colleagues in the office, but sometimes they  
get promotions; you do not. You started a business several years ago, but you  
are not as successful as your neighbor whose business is only one year old.  
There are several examples like these in everyday life. Should you be jealous?  
No. Remember everybody's life is shaped by his/her destiny, which has now  
become his/her reality. If you are destined to be rich, nothing in the world  
can stop you. If you are not so destined, no one can help you either. Nothing  
will be gained by blaming others for your misfortune. Jealousy will not get  
you anywhere; it will only take away your peace of mind.   
**5\. Change Yourself According To The Environment:**   
If you try to change the environment single-handedly, the chances are you will  
fail. Instead, change yourself to suit your environment. As you do this, even  
the environment, which has been unfriendly to you, will mysteriously change  
and seem congenial and harmonious.   
**6\. Endure What Cannot Be Cured:**   
This is the best way to turn a disadvantage into an advantage. Every day we  
face numerous inconveniences, ailments, irritations, and accidents that are  
beyond our control. If we cannot control them or change them, we must learn to  
put up with these things. We must learn to endure them cheerfully. Believe in  
yourself and you will gain in terms of patience, inner strength and will  
power.   
**7\. Do Not Bite Off More Than You Can Chew:**   
This maxim needs to be remembered constantly. We often tend to take more  
responsibilities than we are capable of carrying out. This is done to satisfy  
our ego. Know your limitations.. Why take on additional loads that may create  
more worries? You cannot gain peace of mind by expanding your external  
activities. Reduce your material engagements and spend time in prayer,  
introspection and meditation. This will reduce those thoughts in your mind  
that make you restless. Uncluttered mind will produce greater peace of mind.   
**8\. Meditate Regularly:**   
Meditation calms the mind and gets rid of disturbing thoughts. This is the  
highest state of peace of mind. Try and experience it yourself. If you  
meditate earnestly for half an hour everyday, your mind will tend to become  
peaceful during the remaining twenty-three and half-hours. Your mind will not  
be easily disturbed as it was before. You would benefit by gradually  
increasing the period of daily meditation. You may think that this will  
interfere with your daily work. On the contrary, this will increase your  
efficiency and you will be able to produce better results in less time.   
**9\. Never Leave The Mind Vacant:**   
An empty mind is the devil's workshop. All evil actions start in the vacant  
mind. Keep your mind occupied in something positive, something worthwhile.  
Actively follow a hobby. Do something that holds your interest. You must  
decide what you value more: money or peace of mind. Your hobby, like social  
work or religious work, may not always earn you more money, but you will have  
a sense of fulfillment and achievement. Even when you are resting physically,  
occupy yourself in healthy reading or mental chanting of God's name.   
**10\. Do Not Procrastinate And Never Regret:**   
Do not waste time in protracted wondering " Should I or shouldn't I?" Days,  
weeks, months, and years may be wasted in that futile mental debating. You can  
never plan enough because you can never anticipate all future happenings.  
Value your time and do the things that need to be done. It does not matter if  
you fail the first time. You can learn from your mistakes and succeed the next  
time. Sitting back and worrying will lead to nothing. Learn from your  
mistakes, but do not brood over the past. DO NOT REGRET. Whatever happened was  
destined to happen only that way. Why cry over spilt milk?

Mind can never be kept empty. The best way, in my view, is to   
keep it engaged in sattvic work, like gardening, telling beads, or   
some non-profit social work like teaching children, learning simple   
new arts like singing Bhagavan Ramana's poems in a low tone and   
enjoying the contents and the music. When one goes to bed, before   
you get into deep sleep, chant some holy names.   
Arunachala Siva.

well said Subramanian garu.   
Once there was discussion between Varanasi Subbalakshmi garu and bhagavan and  
it goes like this   
Quote  
V S : "What have I got except endless work in the kitchen?" Bhagavan said  
with deep feeling: B: "Your hands may do the work but your mind can remain still.   
You are that which never move Realize that and you will find that work is not  
a strain.   
But as long as you think that you are the body and that the work is done by  
you,you will feel your life to be an endless toil.   
In fact, it is the mind that toils, not the body.   
Even if your body keeps quiet, will your mind keep quiet too?   
Even in sleep the mind is busy with its dreams."

Amiatall Garu,   
There is no concept of empty mind in waking state according to me.   
I am sure not all bhagavan devotees are in agreement with me.   
Anyhow i suggest we leave all these *theory* discussions whether one can  
achieve empty mind or not but rather try to control our thoughts as suggested  
by bhagavan and bhagavad gita and kill our ego as far as possible.

Arunachala Ramana forum thrives only on "theory" discussions and this is  
evident on discussions.discussions and more discussions on Bhagavan's  
teachings. Bhagavan ramana has given very crystal clear instructions on mano  
nigraham and there is no need for any discussion on Bhagavan's teachings at  
all.His teachings are so simple to understand that great devotees like  
Annamalai Swami who was not highly educated could easily understand Bhagavan's  
teachings and could practice. **Bhagavan clearly says that if we do not  
practice atma vichara, mind will start doing ulaka vichara and hence we should  
not give room to the mind to do for ulaka vichara. All these endless  
discussions fall under ulaka vichara only.** He categorically told that if we  
practice atma vichara,then the mind will get its strength to stay in its  
source and mind will not stray thinking about past and future. **Bhagavan says  
that the conclusive evidence of all scriptures is that we have do control  
the mind and he asks us how can we do that by just reading endless  
books(also endless discussion) instead of practicing?All these discussions  
help only to strength our ego and do not help us to erase the ego.Hence if  
we have to erase the Ego, who have to turn our attention inwards known in  
tamil as SUMMS IRU.** **Are we?**

Dear Mr.Amiatall,   
 Thia is in response to reply no 8 posted by you.I am deeply attached to Bhagavan's teachings and i take his teaching as gold standard.His teachings are rational, free from rituals, applicable to people of different faiths, simple and is in line with sastras. As per Bhagavan, the root cause for all problem is Ego and he wants us to erase this ego and he has given simple method.He never asked anybody to stop working/stop earning money/stop having relationship.In fact when some of the house holders wanted to leave the family and serve the ashram, he never encouraged them to do so.. When some body wanted sit and do continuous meditation for hours together without doing any work he never encouraged that. In fact sastra itself says that we should earn our livelihood.What Bhagavan wants us is to get rid of the notion "I and Mine''.Once we do any work without that notion, then there is no role for the ego.You may recall the history wherein countries fought endless wars because of strong notion of I and Mine of individuals and examples are many such as Hitler, Mussolini,Japanese ruler,Sadham Husain etc.   
 **To get rid of of "I' notion also known as ahamkara, Bhagavan has given an unique method which we do not find even in sastras and that unique method is called self enquiry which is nothing but cutting I thought at its root when ever it props up. **Any body can do this practice since it is not restricted any to caste, community or profession.We can practice self enquiry while walking, sitting,, driving and even while one is brushing the teeth or while in rest room.While your attention is inwards, your external activities will not at all be affected.It will get affected only when self attention is lost.It is like this.When you are attending to some serious work, there wont be any thought about past or future and your full attention will be on the job and in this state, you are automatically going inwards and you are in meditation without yourself aware that you are in meditation. You will complete the job perfectly well without any mistake.However, if some thought props up while you are on the job, it means that thinker has come(I notion) since there cannot be a thought without thinker. Then your concentration in the job will be lost and you will make mistake in that job.   
 To your question on what will change after realization,the very fact that one is attracted to Bhagavan's teaching & attracted to Arunachala ramana forum means that at present he is unhappy and want happiness and peace. He will get happiness and peace when he sheds the"I and Mine" notion collectively called Ego. Bhagavan has given a practical method to erase the ego and to my knowledge no body has given such simple method and that is why Bhagavan's teachings are popular through out the world.. What will happen by turning attention inwards cannot be explained in words but has to be experienced by oneself.

well said Subramanian garu.   
Once there was discussion between Varanasi Subbalakshmi garu and bhagavan and  
it goes like this   
Quote  
V S : "What have I got except endless work in the kitchen?" Bhagavan said  
with deep feeling: B: "Your hands may do the work but your mind can remain still.   
You are that which never move Realize that and you will find that work is not  
a strain.   
But as long as you think that you are the body and that the work is done by  
you,you will feel your life to be an endless toil.   
In fact, it is the mind that toils, not the body.   
Even if your body keeps quiet, will your mind keep quiet too?   
Even in sleep the mind is busy with its dreams."

Amiatall Garu,   
There is no concept of empty mind in waking state according to me.   
I am sure not all bhagavan devotees are in agreement with me.   
Anyhow i suggest we leave all these *theory* discussions whether one can  
achieve empty mind or not but rather try to control our thoughts as suggested  
by bhagavan and bhagavad gita and kill our ego as far as possible.

Arunachala Ramana forum thrives only on "theory" discussions and this is  
evident on discussions.discussions and more discussions on Bhagavan's  
teachings. Bhagavan ramana has given very crystal clear instructions on mano  
nigraham and there is no need for any discussion on Bhagavan's teachings at  
all.His teachings are so simple to understand that great devotees like  
Annamalai Swami who was not highly educated could easily understand Bhagavan's  
teachings and could practice. **Bhagavan clearly says that if we do not  
practice atma vichara, mind will start doing ulaka vichara and hence we should  
not give room to the mind to do for ulaka vichara. All these endless  
discussions fall under ulaka vichara only.** He categorically told that if we  
practice atma vichara,then the mind will get its strength to stay in its  
source and mind will not stray thinking about past and future. **Bhagavan says  
that the conclusive evidence of all scriptures is that we have do control  
the mind and he asks us how can we do that by just reading endless  
books(also endless discussion) instead of practicing?All these discussions  
help only to strength our ego and do not help us to erase the ego.Hence if  
we have to erase the Ego, who have to turn our attention inwards known in  
tamil as SUMMS IRU.** **Are we?**

Dear Mr.Amiatall,   
 Thia is in response to reply no 8 posted by you.I am deeply attached to Bhagavan's teachings and i take his teaching as gold standard.His teachings are rational, free from rituals, applicable to people of different faiths, simple and is in line with sastras. As per Bhagavan, the root cause for all problem is Ego and he wants us to erase this ego and he has given simple method.He never asked anybody to stop working/stop earning money/stop having relationship.In fact when some of the house holders wanted to leave the family and serve the ashram, he never encouraged them to do so.. When some body wanted sit and do continuous meditation for hours together without doing any work he never encouraged that. In fact sastra itself says that we should earn our livelihood.What Bhagavan wants us is to get rid of the notion "I and Mine''.Once we do any work without that notion, then there is no role for the ego.You may recall the history wherein countries fought endless wars because of strong notion of I and Mine of individuals and examples are many such as Hitler, Mussolini,Japanese ruler,Sadham Husain etc.   
 **To get rid of of "I' notion also known as ahamkara, Bhagavan has given an unique method which we do not find even in sastras and that unique method is called self enquiry which is nothing but cutting I thought at its root when ever it props up. **Any body can do this practice since it is not restricted any to caste, community or profession.We can practice self enquiry while walking, sitting,, driving and even while one is brushing the teeth or while in rest room.While your attention is inwards, your external activities will not at all be affected.It will get affected only when self attention is lost.It is like this.When you are attending to some serious work, there wont be any thought about past or future and your full attention will be on the job and in this state, you are automatically going inwards and you are in meditation without yourself aware that you are in meditation. You will complete the job perfectly well without any mistake.However, if some thought props up while you are on the job, it means that thinker has come(I notion) since there cannot be a thought without thinker. Then your concentration in the job will be lost and you will make mistake in that job.   
 To your question on what will change after realization,the very fact that one is attracted to Bhagavan's teaching & attracted to Arunachala ramana forum means that at present he is unhappy and want happiness and peace. He will get happiness and peace when he sheds the"I and Mine" notion collectively called Ego. Bhagavan has given a practical method to erase the ego and to my knowledge no body has given such simple method and that is why Bhagavan's teachings are popular through out the world.. What will happen by turning attention inwards cannot be explained in words but has to be experienced by oneself.

Now, I ask: doing discussing how discussion is pointless;   
doing discussing of various teachings;   
doing "SUMA IRU".   
There can endless discussions on objects whereas what is there to discuss  
about SELF which is the nothing but state of BEING or SILENCE.Also we do  
not discuss the gospel of sages such as Sri.Ramakrishna,Swami Viekananda,  
Paramacharya of Kanchi, Jesus Christ and other sages since their teachings  
are revelations.What Bhagavan says is that we have to throw away the  
books(meaning stop reading) at certain stage and try to BE.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Ten principles for the PEACE of MIND  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 28, 2010, 10:06:41 AM  
---  
**1\. Do Not Interfere In Others ' Business Unless Asked.  
Most of us create our own problems by interfering too often in others'  
affairs. We do so because somehow we have convinced ourselves that our way is  
the best way, our logic is the perfect logic and those who do not conform to  
our thinking must be criticized and steered to the right direction, our  
direction. This thinking denies the existence of individuality and  
consequently the existence of God.. God has created each one of us in a unique  
way. No two human beings can think or act in exactly the same way. All men or  
women act the way they do because God within them prompts them that way. Mind  
your own business and you will keep your peace.   
**2\. Forgive And Forget:**   
This is the most powerful aid to peace of mind. We often develop ill feelings  
inside our heart for the person who insults us or harms us. We nurture  
grievances. This in turn results in loss of sleep, development of stomach  
ulcers, and high blood pressure. This insult or injury was done once, but  
nourishing of grievance goes on forever by constantly remembering it. Get over  
this bad habit. Life is too short to waste in such trifles. Forgive,20Forget,  
and march on. Love flourishes in giving and forgiving.   
**3\. Do Not Crave For Recogniti  
DateTime: This world is full of selfish people. They seldom praise anybody without  
selfish motives. They may praise you today because you are in power, but no  
sooner than you are powerless, they will forget your achievement and will  
start finding faults in you. Why do you wish to kill yourse lf in striving for  
their recognition? Their recognition is not worth the aggravation. Do your  
duties ethically and sincerely.   
**4\. Do Not Be Jealous:**   
We all have experienced how jealousy can disturb our peace of mind. You know  
that you work harder than your colleagues in the office, but sometimes they  
get promotions; you do not. You started a business several years ago, but you  
are not as successful as your neighbor whose business is only one year old.  
There are several examples like these in everyday life. Should you be jealous?  
No. Remember everybody's life is shaped by his/her destiny, which has now  
become his/her reality. If you are destined to be rich, nothing in the world  
can stop you. If you are not so destined, no one can help you either. Nothing  
will be gained by blaming others for your misfortune. Jealousy will not get  
you anywhere; it will only take away your peace of mind.   
**5\. Change Yourself According To The Environment:**   
If you try to change the environment single-handedly, the chances are you will  
fail. Instead, change yourself to suit your environment. As you do this, even  
the environment, which has been unfriendly to you, will mysteriously change  
and seem congenial and harmonious.   
**6\. Endure What Cannot Be Cured:**   
This is the best way to turn a disadvantage into an advantage. Every day we  
face numerous inconveniences, ailments, irritations, and accidents that are  
beyond our control. If we cannot control them or change them, we must learn to  
put up with these things. We must learn to endure them cheerfully. Believe in  
yourself and you will gain in terms of patience, inner strength and will  
power.   
**7\. Do Not Bite Off More Than You Can Chew:**   
This maxim needs to be remembered constantly. We often tend to take more  
responsibilities than we are capable of carrying out. This is done to satisfy  
our ego. Know your limitations.. Why take on additional loads that may create  
more worries? You cannot gain peace of mind by expanding your external  
activities. Reduce your material engagements and spend time in prayer,  
introspection and meditation. This will reduce those thoughts in your mind  
that make you restless. Uncluttered mind will produce greater peace of mind.   
**8\. Meditate Regularly:**   
Meditation calms the mind and gets rid of disturbing thoughts. This is the  
highest state of peace of mind. Try and experience it yourself. If you  
meditate earnestly for half an hour everyday, your mind will tend to become  
peaceful during the remaining twenty-three and half-hours. Your mind will not  
be easily disturbed as it was before. You would benefit by gradually  
increasing the period of daily meditation. You may think that this will  
interfere with your daily work. On the contrary, this will increase your  
efficiency and you will be able to produce better results in less time.   
**9\. Never Leave The Mind Vacant:**   
An empty mind is the devil's workshop. All evil actions start in the vacant  
mind. Keep your mind occupied in something positive, something worthwhile.  
Actively follow a hobby. Do something that holds your interest. You must  
decide what you value more: money or peace of mind. Your hobby, like social  
work or religious work, may not always earn you more money, but you will have  
a sense of fulfillment and achievement. Even when you are resting physically,  
occupy yourself in healthy reading or mental chanting of God's name.   
**10\. Do Not Procrastinate And Never Regret:**   
Do not waste time in protracted wondering " Should I or shouldn't I?" Days,  
weeks, months, and years may be wasted in that futile mental debating. You can  
never plan enough because you can never anticipate all future happenings.  
Value your time and do the things that need to be done. It does not matter if  
you fail the first time. You can learn from your mistakes and succeed the next  
time. Sitting back and worrying will lead to nothing. Learn from your  
mistakes, but do not brood over the past. DO NOT REGRET. Whatever happened was  
destined to happen only that way. Why cry over spilt milk?

Mind can never be kept empty. The best way, in my view, is to   
keep it engaged in sattvic work, like gardening, telling beads, or   
some non-profit social work like teaching children, learning simple   
new arts like singing Bhagavan Ramana's poems in a low tone and   
enjoying the contents and the music. When one goes to bed, before   
you get into deep sleep, chant some holy names.   
Arunachala Siva.

about SELF which is the nothing but state of BEING or SILENCE.Also we do  
not discuss the gospel of sages such as Sri.Ramakrishna,Swami Viekananda,  
Paramacharya of Kanchi, Jesus Christ and other sages since their teachings  
are revelations.What Bhagavan says is that we have to throw away the  
books(meaning stop reading) at certain stage and try to BE.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Ten principles for the PEACE of MIND

**1\. Do Not Interfere In Others ' Business Unless Asked.  
Most of us create our own problems by interfering too often in others'  
affairs. We do so because somehow we have convinced ourselves that our way is  
the best way, our logic is the perfect logic and those who do not conform to  
our thinking must be criticized and steered to the right direction, our  
direction. This thinking denies the existence of individuality and  
consequently the existence of God.. God has created each one of us in a unique  
way. No two human beings can think or act in exactly the same way. All men or  
women act the way they do because God within them prompts them that way. Mind  
your own business and you will keep your peace.   
**2\. Forgive And Forget:**   
This is the most powerful aid to peace of mind. We often develop ill feelings  
inside our heart for the person who insults us or harms us. We nurture  
grievances. This in turn results in loss of sleep, development of stomach  
ulcers, and high blood pressure. This insult or injury was done once, but  
nourishing of grievance goes on forever by constantly remembering it. Get over  
this bad habit. Life is too short to waste in such trifles. Forgive,20Forget,  
and march on. Love flourishes in giving and forgiving.   
**3\. Do Not Crave For Recogniti  
DateTime: This world is full of selfish people. They seldom praise anybody without  
selfish motives. They may praise you today because you are in power, but no  
sooner than you are powerless, they will forget your achievement and will  
start finding faults in you. Why do you wish to kill yourse lf in striving for  
their recognition? Their recognition is not worth the aggravation. Do your  
duties ethically and sincerely.   
**4\. Do Not Be Jealous:**   
We all have experienced how jealousy can disturb our peace of mind. You know  
that you work harder than your colleagues in the office, but sometimes they  
get promotions; you do not. You started a business several years ago, but you  
are not as successful as your neighbor whose business is only one year old.  
There are several examples like these in everyday life. Should you be jealous?  
No. Remember everybody's life is shaped by his/her destiny, which has now  
become his/her reality. If you are destined to be rich, nothing in the world  
can stop you. If you are not so destined, no one can help you either. Nothing  
will be gained by blaming others for your misfortune. Jealousy will not get  
you anywhere; it will only take away your peace of mind.   
**5\. Change Yourself According To The Environment:**   
If you try to change the environment single-handedly, the chances are you will  
fail. Instead, change yourself to suit your environment. As you do this, even  
the environment, which has been unfriendly to you, will mysteriously change  
and seem congenial and harmonious.   
**6\. Endure What Cannot Be Cured:**   
This is the best way to turn a disadvantage into an advantage. Every day we  
face numerous inconveniences, ailments, irritations, and accidents that are  
beyond our control. If we cannot control them or change them, we must learn to  
put up with these things. We must learn to endure them cheerfully. Believe in  
yourself and you will gain in terms of patience, inner strength and will  
power.   
**7\. Do Not Bite Off More Than You Can Chew:**   
This maxim needs to be remembered constantly. We often tend to take more  
responsibilities than we are capable of carrying out. This is done to satisfy  
our ego. Know your limitations.. Why take on additional loads that may create  
more worries? You cannot gain peace of mind by expanding your external  
activities. Reduce your material engagements and spend time in prayer,  
introspection and meditation. This will reduce those thoughts in your mind  
that make you restless. Uncluttered mind will produce greater peace of mind.   
**8\. Meditate Regularly:**   
Meditation calms the mind and gets rid of disturbing thoughts. This is the  
highest state of peace of mind. Try and experience it yourself. If you  
meditate earnestly for half an hour everyday, your mind will tend to become  
peaceful during the remaining twenty-three and half-hours. Your mind will not  
be easily disturbed as it was before. You would benefit by gradually  
increasing the period of daily meditation. You may think that this will  
interfere with your daily work. On the contrary, this will increase your  
efficiency and you will be able to produce better results in less time.   
**9\. Never Leave The Mind Vacant:**   
An empty mind is the devil's workshop. All evil actions start in the vacant  
mind. Keep your mind occupied in something positive, something worthwhile.  
Actively follow a hobby. Do something that holds your interest. You must  
decide what you value more: money or peace of mind. Your hobby, like social  
work or religious work, may not always earn you more money, but you will have  
a sense of fulfillment and achievement. Even when you are resting physically,  
occupy yourself in healthy reading or mental chanting of God's name.   
**10\. Do Not Procrastinate And Never Regret:**   
Do not waste time in protracted wondering " Should I or shouldn't I?" Days,  
weeks, months, and years may be wasted in that futile mental debating. You can  
never plan enough because you can never anticipate all future happenings.  
Value your time and do the things that need to be done. It does not matter if  
you fail the first time. You can learn from your mistakes and succeed the next  
time. Sitting back and worrying will lead to nothing. Learn from your  
mistakes, but do not brood over the past. DO NOT REGRET. Whatever happened was  
destined to happen only that way. Why cry over spilt milk?

Mind can never be kept empty. The best way, in my view, is to   
keep it engaged in sattvic work, like gardening, telling beads, or   
some non-profit social work like teaching children, learning simple   
new arts like singing Bhagavan Ramana's poems in a low tone and   
enjoying the contents and the music. When one goes to bed, before   
you get into deep sleep, chant some holy names.   
Arunachala Siva.

well said Subramanian garu.   
Once there was discussion between Varanasi Subbalakshmi garu and bhagavan and  
it goes like this   
Quote  
V S : "What have I got except endless work in the kitchen?" Bhagavan said  
with deep feeling: B: "Your hands may do the work but your mind can remain still.   
You are that which never move Realize that and you will find that work is not  
a strain.   
But as long as you think that you are the body and that the work is done by  
you,you will feel your life to be an endless toil.   
In fact, it is the mind that toils, not the body.   
Even if your body keeps quiet, will your mind keep quiet too?   
Even in sleep the mind is busy with its dreams."

Amiatall Garu,   
There is no concept of empty mind in waking state according to me.   
I am sure not all bhagavan devotees are in agreement with me.   
Anyhow i suggest we leave all these *theory* discussions whether one can  
achieve empty mind or not but rather try to control our thoughts as suggested  
by bhagavan and bhagavad gita and kill our ego as far as possible.

Arunachala Ramana forum thrives only on "theory" discussions and this is  
evident on discussions.discussions and more discussions on Bhagavan's  
teachings. Bhagavan ramana has given very crystal clear instructions on mano  
nigraham and there is no need for any discussion on Bhagavan's teachings at  
all.His teachings are so simple to understand that great devotees like  
Annamalai Swami who was not highly educated could easily understand Bhagavan's  
teachings and could practice. **Bhagavan clearly says that if we do not  
practice atma vichara, mind will start doing ulaka vichara and hence we should  
not give room to the mind to do for ulaka vichara. All these endless  
discussions fall under ulaka vichara only.** He categorically told that if we  
practice atma vichara,then the mind will get its strength to stay in its  
source and mind will not stray thinking about past and future. **Bhagavan says  
that the conclusive evidence of all scriptures is that we have do control  
the mind and he asks us how can we do that by just reading endless  
books(also endless discussion) instead of practicing?All these discussions  
help only to strength our ego and do not help us to erase the ego.Hence if  
we have to erase the Ego, who have to turn our attention inwards known in  
tamil as SUMMS IRU.** **Are we?**

Dear Mr.Amiatall,   
 Thia is in response to reply no 8 posted by you.I am deeply attached to Bhagavan's teachings and i take his teaching as gold standard.His teachings are rational, free from rituals, applicable to people of different faiths, simple and is in line with sastras. As per Bhagavan, the root cause for all problem is Ego and he wants us to erase this ego and he has given simple method.He never asked anybody to stop working/stop earning money/stop having relationship.In fact when some of the house holders wanted to leave the family and serve the ashram, he never encouraged them to do so.. When some body wanted sit and do continuous meditation for hours together without doing any work he never encouraged that. In fact sastra itself says that we should earn our livelihood.What Bhagavan wants us is to get rid of the notion "I and Mine''.Once we do any work without that notion, then there is no role for the ego.You may recall the history wherein countries fought endless wars because of strong notion of I and Mine of individuals and examples are many such as Hitler, Mussolini,Japanese ruler,Sadham Husain etc.   
 **To get rid of of "I' notion also known as ahamkara, Bhagavan has given an unique method which we do not find even in sastras and that unique method is called self enquiry which is nothing but cutting I thought at its root when ever it props up. **Any body can do this practice since it is not restricted any to caste, community or profession.We can practice self enquiry while walking, sitting,, driving and even while one is brushing the teeth or while in rest room.While your attention is inwards, your external activities will not at all be affected.It will get affected only when self attention is lost.It is like this.When you are attending to some serious work, there wont be any thought about past or future and your full attention will be on the job and in this state, you are automatically going inwards and you are in meditation without yourself aware that you are in meditation. You will complete the job perfectly well without any mistake.However, if some thought props up while you are on the job, it means that thinker has come(I notion) since there cannot be a thought without thinker. Then your concentration in the job will be lost and you will make mistake in that job.   
 To your question on what will change after realization,the very fact that one is attracted to Bhagavan's teaching & attracted to Arunachala ramana forum means that at present he is unhappy and want happiness and peace. He will get happiness and peace when he sheds the"I and Mine" notion collectively called Ego. Bhagavan has given a practical method to erase the ego and to my knowledge no body has given such simple method and that is why Bhagavan's teachings are popular through out the world.. What will happen by turning attention inwards cannot be explained in words but has to be experienced by oneself.

In my above post there are some spelling mistakes. **PROPS UP** should be read  
as **POPS UP.The reason for spelling mistakes in my posts is primarily due  
to my poor eye sight due to Retina detachment and the other reason is that I  
am not proficient in english since my mother tongue is Tamil.Moreover I have  
studied in Tinnai Pallikoodam and i am not convent educated.Hope readers will  
pardon me for my mistakes.**

Now, I ask: doing discussing how discussion is pointless;   
doing discussing of various teachings;   
doing "SUMA IRU".   
There can endless discussions on objects whereas what is there to discuss  
about SELF which is the nothing but state of BEING or SILENCE.Also we do
