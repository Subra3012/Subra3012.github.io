Verse 10: மத்த னாய்மதி யாது மலைதனை   
எத்தி னான்திரள் தோண்முடி பத்திற   
ஒத்தி னான்விர லாலொருங் கேத்தலும்   
பொத்தி னான்புக லூரைத் தொழுமினே.   
Siva gently pressed with his toe to break the heads and globular shoulders of  
Ravanan, who, being puffed up with pride, tried to throw away the mountain by  
uprooting it, without regarding it was the abode of Siva. People of this  
world!   
Worship with joined hands Pukalūr, belonging to Siva who protected Ravanan,  
when he praised Siva in thought, word and deed.   
Padigam on Tirup Pukalur completed.   
Arunachala Siva.
