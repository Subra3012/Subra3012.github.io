The following are the Morning / Evening Vedic and Sanskrit Chants as followed  
in Ramana Ashram and I believe Bhagwan did give an outline for the same and  
others added some later. I once asked David Godman about this but he could  
not give me the proper answer to its background.   
If there is any changes in the list, I will make it.   
Ramana Ashram Morning Vedic and Sanskrit Chants at 8 a.m**   
1) Sri Ramna Chatvarimshat   
2) Sri Arunachla Pancharatnam   
3) Sri Taittriya Upanishad ( Sikisha /Anand /Bhrigu Valli )   
4) Sri Suktam   
5)Maha Narayana Upanishad ( some portions )   
Ramana Ashram Evening Vedic & Sanskrit Chants at 5 p.m**   
1)Dakshinamurti Stotram   
2) Sri Rudram   
3) Chamakam   
4) Purusha Suktam, Narayana Suktam,Durga Suktam   
5) Mantra Pushpam.   
 6)Upadesa Saram   
7) Nakarmana   
I have updated the list to make some changes after seeing the final version  
from the book  
"The Veda Parayana At Sri RamanaAshram - An English  
Translation .   
 **According to this book :**   
1) In Sri Bhgawan's lifetime, Vedic Chanting/Veda Parayana was held twice a  
day morning and evening, lasting about 40 mts on each occasion, and this is  
still continued.   
2) This with the Puja which follows it is the only ritual which was or is  
generally attended at the Ashram.   
 **3) It was an hour of tremendous silence when he sat immobile as though  
carved in rock. He never allowed anything to interrupt it. **   
 **4) When asked whether people should learn the meaning, so as to follow it,   
he said no : It was sufficient that the chanting served as a support for  
meditation. **   
5) Despite this, it is also true, however, that the portions used for  
chanting were carefully chosen and approved by Sri Bhgawan Himself.   
 **6) Nothing has been deleted from them since Sri Bhagwan 's lifetime and  
only one item added. That is Sri Dakshinamurti Stotra which, mainly on the  
request of the late Major Chadwick ( Sadhu Arunachala ) is now used as the  
opening hymn before the evening chant. **   
7) Technically in the past even listening to the Chanting of Vedas is supposed  
to made available only to Brahmins, but this prohibition was abrogated by Sri  
Bhagwan.

I like this. Devotees actually doing the sacred Hindu spiritual practices and  
connecting directly with the Divine.   
I know everyone will have great experiences and homes will be filled with  
Divine energy.

Dear Child Of Arunachala   
This is what I say to people who say they do not have time to visit the parent  
spiritual Organization ( like Ramana Ashram, Sivananda Ashram, Chinmaya  
Ashram, Ramakrishna Asharm etc ) i.e best is to follow some of the schedules  
there at your own home at least once in morning / evening preferably at the  
same time. If there is a morning aarthi / meditation there then follow it at  
the same time and if it is difficult in morning then try to follow it in  
evening. If it is difficult in the weekdays then follow the Sunday /Saturday  
Satsangs at least at your own house at the same time. Unless and until we try  
to develop some form of samskaras at home itself we will not progress much.   
Every Spiritual Organization has its own Satsang format that people can follow  
at least once a week if not daily at their own homes.   
The following gives the Satsang format as advised by Sri Ramana Ashram**   
http://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/centres/satsang-format/   
What are Ramana Satsang?   
A Ramana satsang is a group of devotees of Sri Ramana Maharshi who gather  
together to strengthen their experience of the presence of Sri Ramana, deepen  
their understanding of his teachings and receive inspiration from fellow  
seekers on the path of practice as taught and lived by the Master.   
These meetings usually take place at devotees? homes, on a weekly, biweekly,  
or monthly basis.   
**A typical satsang program is as follows:**   
 1) Reading of the Teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi, from Talks with Sri  
Ramana Maharshi, or some similar book.   
 **2) Satsang Recitations ( A. AksaharaMana Malai 2.Ramana Satguru  
 3.Upadesa Saram 4.Arunachala Pancharatham 5.Nakarmana )  
 **3)Silent Meditation: this will vary from 15 minutes to an hour.**   
 4)A reading of Reminiscences of the Maharshi, from books like Letters from Sri Ramanasramam, etc.   
 5) If parents bring their children to the satsang, the children are  
encouraged to sing a bhajan or song from the Ramana Bhaje Namam CD or from  
some other composition on or about Sri Ramana.   
This concludes the satsang. Often arrangements for refreshments are made and  
then served to the devotees at this time.   
The Audios for the Satsang recitations are available for free download at the  
link above.

द्वा सुपर्णा सयुजा सखाया समानं वृक्षंपरिषस्वजाते ।   
तयोरन्यः पिप्पलं स्वाद्वत्त्य नश्नन्नन्योऽभिचाकशीति ॥१॥   
ऋग्वेद म.1 सू.164 म.20   
dhvA suparNA sayujA sakhAyA samAnam vRukShampariShasvajAthE.   
thayOranyah pippalam svAdvakthya nashnannanyOaBhicAkashIthi. .1..   
RugvEda Mandala 1, sUkthA 164, manthrA 20   
This beautiful verse, occurring in the Rg Veda, enunciates the Eternal Triad -  
jivAthman, Paramatma and Prakriti -   
Two birds (सुपर्णा), eternal friends (सखाया), inseparable (सयुजा), perched  
together on a Tree. The first one enjoys the fruit borne by the tree, while  
the other merely observes in silence."   
The one that enjoys the fruit is jivAtman, the individual soul, while the one  
that observes is paramAthman. They both, inseparable friends that they are,  
are perched on the Peepal Tree, which represents prakRuthi. The one that  
performs Action is the individual soul, the jivAthman. Having acted, it enjoys  
the fruits of the Act. paramAthman merely watches. paramAthman neither  
performs Action nor enjoys subsequently the fruits of the Act.   
This verse brings out the relation between the three components of the Eternal  
Triad. Atman and Paramatman are joined together in a relationship of eternal  
friendship as allegorically stated in the phrase - सयुजा सखाया. While the  
former performs actions and enjoys the fruit of his actions, the later merely  
enjoys in being the Silent Witness to the Acts of Atman. Atman interacts with  
prakRuthi whereas paramAthman remains aloof, merely observing.   
Athman is passive observer, untouched, unaffected. shudDha prajnyA

**KAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas- _The Ten Upanishads_**   
Sankara Bhagavatpada selected ten out of the numerous Upanisads to comment  
upon from the non-dualistic point of view. Ramanuja, Madhva and others who  
came after him wrote commentaries on the same based on their own philosophical  
points of view. These ten Upanisads are listed in the following stanza for the  
names to be easily remembered.   
 **Isa-Kena-Katha-Prasna-Munda-Mandukya-Tittari Aitareyan ca Chandogyam  
Brhadranyakam dasa**   
Sankara has followed the same order in his Bhasya (commentary). "Isa" is  
Isavasya Upanisad (Isavasyopanishad). It occurs towards the end of the Samhita  
of Sukla Yajurveda. The name of this Upanisad is derived from its very first  
word, "Isavasya". The next, "Kena", is Kenopanisad. The Isavasyopanisad  
proclaims that the entire world is pervaded by Isvara and that we must  
dedicate all our works to him and attain the Paramatman.   
An elephant made of wood looks real to a child. Grown-ups realise that, though  
it resembles an elephant in shape, it is really wood. To the child the wood is  
concealed, revealing the elephant; to the grown-up the animal is hidden  
revealing the wood. Similarly, all this world and the five elements are made  
of the timber called the Paramatman. We must learn to look upon all this as  
the Supreme Godhead.   
 **Marattai maraittadu mamada yanai   
Marattil maraindadu mamada yanai   
Parattai maraittadu parmudal bhutam   
Parattil maraindadu parmudal bhutam**   
Tirumalar says in this stanza that, because of our being accustomed to seeing  
the five elements all the time, we must not forget that the Paramatman is  
hidden in them. We must recognise that it is indeed he who pervades them and  
learn to see that everything is instinct with Isvara. Sankara expresses  
exactly the same idea in his Bhasya when he speaks of "dantini daru vikare". I  
don't wish to enter into a debate as to who came first, Tirumular or Sankara.  
Great men think alike.

**KAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas- _The Ten Upanishads_** continued...   
 **The Kenopanisad** is also called the Talavakara Upanisad since it occurs in  
the Talavakara Brahmana of the Jaimini Sakha of the Samaveda. This Upanisad  
contains a story about the devas. The celestials in their arrogance failed to  
recognise the Supreme Being whose crown and feet are unknown. Ambika then  
appeared to give instruction in jnana to Indra, the king of the devas. She  
explained to him that all our power emanated from the one Great Power, from  
the one Mahasakti.   
The Acarya has written two types of commentaries for this Upanisad, the first  
word by word as in the case of the other Upanisads and the second sentence by  
sentence. In his Saundaryalahari he has the Kenopanisad in mind when he prays  
to Amba: "Place your feet on my head, the feet that are held by Mother Veda.?  
The Upanisads (Vedanta) are also called "Veda-siras", "Sruti-siras", the  
"head" or "crown" of the Vedas - the Upanisads which are the "end" of the  
Vedas (Vedanta) are also their   
crown. To say that Amba's feet are placed on the head of Mother Veda means  
that they are held by the Upanisads. It is in the Kenopanisad that we see Amba  
appearing as Jnanambika (the goddess of jnana).   
 **" Samaganapriya" is one of her names in the Lalitasahasranama (The One  
Thousand Names of Lalita): this is in keeping with the fact that Amba's glory  
is specially revealed in an Upanisad belonging to the Samaveda**. What we see  
is the object and who see it are the subject: the seen is the object, the seer  
is the subject. We can see our body as an object, we can know about it, know  
whether it is well or ill. It follows that there is an entity other than it  
that sees it, the subject called "we". That which sees is the Atman. The  
subject called the Atman cannot be known by anything else. If it can be known,  
it also becomes an object and it would further mean that there is another  
entity that sees: and that will be the true "we". The Atman that is the true  
"we" can only be the subject and never the object. We may keep aside objects  
like the body and experience ourselves, the subject called "we", but we cannot  
know the "we". "To know" means that there is something other than ourselves to  
be known. It would be absurd to regard the Atman as something other than  
ourselves. The true "we" is the Atman, the Self. "Knowing " it implies that  
that which knows it("we") is different from that which is known (the Self).  
What can be there that is different in us from our true Self? What is it that  
is other than the Self that can know the Self? Nothing. We say "Atmajnana"  
which literally means "knowing the Atman". But is the phrase, "knowing the  
Atman", used in the sense of a subject knowing an object? No. **" Atmajnana"  
means the Self experiencing itself, and that is how "jnana" or "knowing" is to  
be understood**. This is the reason why the Kenopanisad says that "he who says  
that he knows the Atman does not know it". It goes on:"He who says that he  
does not know knows. He who thinks that he knows does not know and he who  
thinks he does not know knows. "

**KAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas- _The Ten Upanishads_ **continued...   
 **The Kathopanisad** comes next. It occurs in the Katha Sakha of the Krsna  
Yajurveda. this Upanisad contains the teachings imparted by Yama to the  
brahmacarin Naciketas. It begins as a story and leads up to the exposition of  
profound philosophical truths. The Gita contains quotations from this  
Upanisad.   
What I said just now about the subject-object relationship is explained in  
depth in the concluding part of the Kathopanisad. How do we remove the ear of  
grain from the stalk? And how do we draw the pith from the reed? Similarly, we  
must draw the subject that is the Self from the object that is the body, says  
the Kathopanishad. **" Desire, anger, hatred, fear, all these appertain to the  
mind, not to the Self. Hunger, thirst and so on appertain to the body - they  
are not 'mine'. " By constant practice we must learn to reject all such things  
as do not belong to the Self by "objectifying them"**.   
 **If we do so with concentration, in due course we will be able to overcome  
the idea that has taken root in us that the body and the mind constitute the  
"we". We can then exist as the immaculate Self without the impurities tainting  
the body and the mind.**   
The Kathopanisad compares the spiritual exercise of separating the Self from  
the body and the mind to that of drawing off the pith, bright, pure and soft,  
from the reed. Before you is the spadix of a plantain. When it wilts do you  
also droop? Think of the body as a lump of flesh closer to you than this  
spadix of the plantain. This spadix is not the subject that is "we", but the  
object. On the same lines you must become accustomed to think of the body as  
an object in relation to the subject that is the Self. During   
our life in this world itself - during the time we seem to exist in our body -  
we must learn to treat the body as not "me", not "mine". **Moksa or liberation  
does not necessarily mean ascending to another world like Kailasa or  
Vaikuntha**. **It can be attained here and now.** What is moksa? It is  
everlasting bliss that comes of being freed from all burden. He who lives  
delighting in his Self in this world itself without any awareness of his body  
is called a "jivanmukta".   
Krsna Paramatman speaks of the same idea in the Gita. He who, while yet in  
this world ("ihaiva"), controls his desire and anger before he is released  
from his body ("prak sariravimoksanat") - he will remain integrated (in yoga)  
and achieve everlasting bliss. **" Ihaiva" = "iha eva", while yet in this  
world**. If you realise the Self, as an inner experience, while yet in this  
world, at the time of your death you will not be aware that your body is  
severed from you. The reason is that even before your death, when you are yet  
in this world, the body does not exist for you. So is there any need for what  
is called death to destroy it? There is no death for the man who has absolute  
realisation of his body being not "he" (when you mention the body the mind is  
also included in it). Where is the question of his dying if he knows that the  
body is not "me" (that is "he")? The death is only for his body.   
The man who has no death thus becomes "amrta" ("immortal"). **Hymns like the  
Purusasukta which appear in the karmakanda of the Vedas also speak of such  
deathlessness. This idea recurs throughout the Upanisads. The body, and the  
mind that functions through it, are the cause of sorrow. All religions are  
agreed that liberation is a state in which sorrow gives place to everlasting  
happiness**. However, according to religious traditions other than Advaita  
(non-dualism), a man has to go to some other world for such bliss after his  
death. Sankara Bhagavatpada establishes that true liberation can be won in  
this world itself if one ceases to identify oneself totally with the body and  
remains rooted in the Self. "Tadetat asariratvam moksakhyam", so he proclaims  
in his Sutrabhasya (1. 1. 4). The word "asariri" is popularly understood as a  
voice we hear without knowing its origin (disembodied voice). It means to be  
without a body. "Asariratvam", bodylessness (being incorporeal), is a state in  
which one is not conscious of the existence of one's body. This is liberation,  
says the Acaya. To remain bodyless, disincarnate, does not mean committing  
suicide. When we reduce our desires little by little a stage will be reached  
when they will be totally rooted out. When they are thus eradicated,  
consciousness of the body will naturally cease too. The Self alone will remain  
then, shining. To arrive at such a state is not necessary to voyage to another  
world. **It is this idea that the Vedas and Vedanta refer to when they say  
"Ihaiva, ihaiva" (Here itself, here itself) - the ideal of liberation here and  
now**.

**KAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas- _The Ten Upanishads_** continued...   
We have two enemies who prevent us from reaching the state of amrta  
(deathlessness): according to the Gita they are desire and anger. The basis  
for this is the Chandogya Upanisad (8. 12. 1) which is a part of the Sruti -  
the passage in which "priya apriya" occurs: the words mean "what one likes and  
what one hates". The first is denoted by desire, of Kama, the second by anger.  
The Chandogya Upanisad says that one who has no body (that is one who is not  
conscious of his body) is not affected either by desire or by anger. That is  
(it says): "If you wish to be free from the evils of desire and anger you  
ought to make ourself without your body (free yourself of our body) right now  
when you are yet in this world".   
 **A jivatman (individual self) is divided into three parts in association  
with the ego: "gaunatman", "mithyatman" and mukhyatman". These are mentioned  
in Sankara's commentary on the Brahmasutra**.   
 **Gauna-mithyatmano 'sattve putradehadi badhanat Sadbrahmatmahamityevam bodhe  
karyam katham bhavaet -Sutrabhasya, 1. 1. 4**   
 **It is part of human nature to believe that one 's children and friends are  
the same as oneself and that their joys and sorrows are one's own. That is  
what is meant by "gaunatman". "Gauna" denotes what is ceremonial or what is  
regarded as a formality. We know that our children and friends are different  
from us and yet we want to believe that they are our own.The "I-feeling" in  
relation to the body which is closer to us than our children and friends is  
"mithyatman".   
There is a state in which the pure Self is seen separate from the body and  
identified inwardly with the Brahman: it is called "mukhyatman"**.   
 **When the first two - gaunatman and mithyatman - are separated from us we  
will be freed from attachments to our children, friends and the body as well  
as its senses. The realisation will dawn then that "I am the Brahman". Now  
there will be nothing for us to "do". This is the meaning of the Sutrabhasya  
passage**.   
 **Swami Vivekananda who wanted to rouse the people of India chose a mantra  
from the Kathopanisad ( "Arise, awake", etc) for the Ramakrsna Mission. This  
Upanisad is the source of many a popular quote. For instance, there is the  
mantra which states that the Self cannot be known either by learning or by the  
strength of one's intellect.   
 "Know that the Self is the Lord of the chariot, that the body is the chariot  
and that the intellect is the charioteer", is another.   
"In the cavern of the heart the Supreme Being is radiant like a thumb of  
light.. . . . . ?   
Then there is the mantra we recite at the time of the "diparadhana rite" ("Na  
tatra suryo bhati.. . "): "The sun does not shine there, nor the moon,   
nor the stars. There is no flash of lightning. Agni too does not shine there.  
When he (the Paramatman) shines everything shines; all his shines by his  
light. ?**   
All our knowledge is derived from that Great Light. With our limited knowledge  
we cannot shed light on that Reality. **Later, the Kathopanisad mentions what  
Sri Krishna Paramatman says in the Gita about the cosmic pipal tree, the  
symbol of samsara or worldly existence. If all the desires of the heart are  
banished a man can become   
immortal and realise the Brahman here itself**.

**KAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas- _The Ten Upanishads_** continued...   
 **After the Kathopanisad comes the Prasnopanisad, the Mundakopanisad and the  
Mandukyopanisad, all three being from the Atharvaveda**. **" Prasna" means  
"question". What is the origin of the various creatures?** **Who are the  
deities that sustain them? How does life imbue the body? What is the truth  
about wakefulness, sleep and the state of dream? What purpose is served by  
being devoted to Om? What is the relationship between the Supreme Godhead and  
the individual self? These questions   
are answered in the Prasnopanisad**.   
 **" Mundana" means "tonsure". Only sannyasins, ascetics with a high degree of  
maturity, are qualified to study the Mundakopanisad -that is how it came to be  
so called**. This Upanisad speaks of the Aksharabrahman, **akshara meaning  
"imperishable" and also "sound". We speak of "Pancaksara", "Astaksara"and so  
on. The source of all sound in "Pranava", or "Omkara". Pranava is a  
particularly efficacious means to attain the Aksarabrahman**.   
 **One mantra in the Mundakopanisad asks us to string the bow of Omkara with  
the arrow of the Atman and hit unperturbed the target called the Brahman. Like  
the arrow you must be one with the Brahman. It is also in this Upanisad that  
the individual self and the Paramatman are compared to two birds perched on  
the body that is the pippala tree. The jivatman (individual self) alone eats  
the fruit (of karma) and the Paramtman bird is merely a witness. This is the  
basis of the biblical story of Adam (Atman) and Eve (jiva). Adam does not eat  
the apple (pippala) but Eve does. The motto of the Union of India - "Satyameva  
Jayate" \- is taken from this Upanisad.**   
There is also a mantra which speaks of sannyasins who, after being jivanmuktas  
in this world, become "videhamuktas" (liberated without their body). It is  
chanted when ascetics are received with honour with a "purna-kumba".   
 **The Mundakopanisad speaks of the jnanin thus: "Different rivers with  
different names lose their names and forms in the ocean. Similarly the knower  
(jnanin) freed from name and form unites inseparably with the Brahman. **"

**KAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas- _The Ten Upanishads[_ /b] continued...   
Next is the **Mandukyopanisad. "Manduka" means "frog". Why the name "Frog  
Upanisad"?** One reason occurs to me: the frog does not have to go step by  
step. It can leap from the first to the fourth step. In the Mandukyopanisad  
the way is shown to reach the turiya or fourth state from the state of  
wakefulness through the states of sleep and dream. **By devoting oneself to  
(by intense meditation of) Om (that is by aksara upasana) one can in one bound  
go up to the fourth state. That perhaps is the reason why this Upanisad is  
called "Mandukya"**. According to modern research scholars, the Mandukya  
Upanisad belonged to a group of people who had the frog as their totem! (It is  
also said that the sage associated with the Upanisad is Varuna who took the  
form of a frog. )   
The text of the Mandukyopanisad is very brief and contains only twelve  
mantras. But it has acquired a special place among seekers because it is  
packed with meaning. It demonstrates the oneness of the individual self and  
the Brahman through the four feet (padas) of Pranava. There is a famous  
passage occurring towards the end of this Upanisad which describes the  
experience of the turiya or fourth state in which all the cosmos is dissolved  
in "Siva-Advaita" (Sivo' dvaita). Sankara Bhagavatpada's guru's guru,  
Gaudapadacarya, has commented on this Upanisad (Mandukyopanisad-Karika) and  
Sankara has written a further commentary on this work.

**KAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas- _The Ten Upanishads_** continued...   
 **Now the Taittriya Upanisad.** I had referred earlier to the  
misunderstanding that developed between Vaisampayana and his disciple  
Yajnavalkya. In his anger the teacher asked his student to eject the Veda he  
has taught him. Yajnavalkya did as bidden. Later the sun god taught him the  
Sukla-Yajurveda which had until then not been revealed to the world.   
It was with the power acquired through mantras that Yajnavalkya became a  
gander to throw up the Veda he had first learned from Vaisampayana. Now that  
master's other disciples, bidden by him assumed the form of tittri birds  
(partridges) and consumed what had been ejected by Yajnavalkya. Thus this  
recension of the Yajurveda came to be called "Taittiriya Sakha". The name  
"Taittiriya" is also applied to the Samhita, Brahmana and Aranyaka of this  
sakha. **The Taittiriya Upanisad is part of the Taittiriya Aranyaka and it is  
perhaps studied more widely than any other Upanisad. Many mantras employed in  
rituals are taken from it**.   
 **There are three part to it - "Siksavalli", "Anandavalli" and  
"Bhruguvalli"**. Sikshavalli contains matters relating to education rules of  
the brahmacaryasrama (the celibate student's stage of life), its importance,  
order of Vedic chanting, meditation of Pranava. **The "Avahanti homa" is in  
Siksavalli. It is performed by the acarya to ensure that disciples come to  
learn from him without any let or hindrance**. We know from our own experience  
that, even today, as a result of performing this sacrifice, Vedic schools  
which were in decay have received a new lease of life with the admission of  
many new students.   
Siksavalli mentions "Atma-swrajya" that is eternal, a state which transcends  
in meaning the "swarajya" we are familiar with in politics.  
"Satyam vada,  
dharmam cara" (Speak the truth, do your duty according to dharma): such  
exhortations to students are contained in this Upanisad. Students are urged  
not to neglect the study of the Vedas at any time**.They are asked to marry  
and beget children so that Vedic learning will be kept up from generation to  
generation. **" Matr-devo bhava, pirt-devo   
bhava, acarya-devo bhava, athithi-devo bhava" (Be one to whom your mother is a  
god; be one to whom your father is a god; be one to whom your teacher is a  
god; be one to whom your guest is a god) - all such mantras are in this  
Upanisad. The importance of charity and dharma is specially stresed here**.   
Earlier I spoke to you about a "multiplication table" of bliss in which each  
successive type of bliss is a hundredfold greater that the previous one.  
Anandavalli is the part of the Taittriya Upanisad in which you see this. **The  
highest form of bliss of ananda in this "table" is Brahmananda (the blis of  
realising the Brahman)**.   
Different sheaths (kosas) of man are mentioned in this Upanisad. The first is  
the "annamaya-kosa" (the sheath of food), the flesh that grows with the intake  
of food. Inside it is the "pranamaya-kosa" (the sheath of vital breath). Then  
comes the "manomaya-kosa" (the sheath of mind) that gives rise to thoughts and  
feelings. The fourth is "vijnanamaya-kosa" (the sheath of understanding). And,  
finally, the fifth, the "anandamaya-kosa" (the sheath of bliss). It is here  
that the Self dwells in blessedness. Each sheath is personified as a bird with  
head, wings, body, belly - there is a philosophical significance in this.  
**This Upanisad contains the oft-quoted mantra ( "Yato vaco nivartante.. .   
")**. It says: " **He who knows the bliss of the Brahman, from which speech  
and mind turn away unable to grasp it, such a man does not have to fear  
anything from anywhere**. "   
"Bhrguvalli" is the teaching (upadesa) imparted by Varuna to his son Bhrgu.  
"Upadesa" here is not to be understood as something dictated by the guru to  
his student. Varuna encourages his son to ascend step by step through his own  
experiments and experience. Bhrugu performs austerities and thinks that the  
sheath of food is the truth. From this stage he advances gradually through the  
sheaths of breath, mind and understanding and arrives at the truth that is the  
sheath of bliss. He realises as an experience that the Atman (the nature of  
bliss) is the ultimate truth.   
 **This does not mean that the Taittriya Upanisad rejects the factual world  
represented by the sheath of food. While being yet in this world, taking part  
in its activities, we must become aware of the supreme truth. For this we must  
strive to make life more dharmic, as a means of Atmic advancement. That is why  
even those who have attained the sheath of bliss are admonished. : "Do not  
speak ill of food. Do not throw it away. Grow plenty of food".  
Even the  
government has used this mantra for its grow more food campaign. **The  
Taittriya Upanisad concludes with the mantra which says: "I am food, I am  
food, the one who eats it.. .   
".

**KAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas- _The Ten Upanishads_** continued...   
 **The Chandyoga and Brhadaranyaka Upanisads are the last two of the ten major  
Upanisads and are also the biggest**. They are bigger than all the other eight  
of the ten put together. **The first is part of the Chandogya Brahmana of the  
Samaveda. "Chandogya" means relating to "chandoga", one who sings the Saman.  
The Tamil Tevaram refers to Paramesvara as "Candogan kan". The Zoroastrian  
scripture called the Zend-Avesta could be treaced back to "Chandoga-Avesta.  
"**   
Just as there are passages in the Gita form the Kathopanisad, so has the  
Brahmasutra passages from the Chandogya Upanisad. In these two Upanisads the  
teachings of a number of sages are put together.   
The introductory mantras of the Chandogya Upanisad refer to Omkara as "udgita"  
and explains how one is to meditate on it. A number of vidyas are mentioned  
like "Aksi", "Akasa", "Madhu", "Sandilya", "Prana", and "Pancagni". These help  
in different ways in knowing the Ultimate Reality.   
 **" Dahara vidya" is the culmination of all these: it means perceiving the  
Supreme Being manifested as the transcadent outward sky in the tiny space in  
our heart**. A number of truths are expounded in this Upanisad in the form of  
stories.   
From the story of Raikva we learn about the strange outward behaviour of one  
who has realised the Brahman. **There is then the famous story of Satyakama  
who does not know his gotra, but is accepted as a pupil by Gautama. The guru  
thinks that Satyakama must be a true Brahmin since he does not hide the truth  
about him. Before the pupil is taught he is made to undergo many tests. The  
guru 's wife, out of concern for the pupil, speaks to her husband for him.  
When we read such stories we have   
before us a true picture of gurukulavasa in ancient times**.   
In character Svetaketu was the opposite of Satyakama and was proud of his  
learning. His father Uddalaka Aruni teaches him to be humble and in the end  
imparts to him the mantra, "Tat tvam asi" (That thou art), the mantra which  
proclaims the non-difference between the individual self and the Brahman. **"  
Tat tvam asi" is the mahavakya of the Samaveda.**   
Unlike Svetaketu, the sage Narada, who had mastered all branches of learning,  
was humble and full of regret that he had remained ignorant of the Atman. He  
finds enlightenment in the teachings of Sanatkumara which are included in the  
Chandogya Upanisad. In the Taittriya Upanisad Bhrgu is taught to go step by  
step to obtain higher knowledge [from the sheath of food to the sheath of  
bliss]. Here Sanatkumara teaches Narada to go from purity of form to purity of  
the inner organs ("antahkaranas"). That is the time when all ties will snap  
and bliss reached.   
 **Another story illustrates how different students benefit differently from  
the same teaching according to the degree of maturity of each. Prajapati gives  
the same instruction to Indra, the king of the celestials, and to Virocana,  
the king of the asuras. This is what Prajapati teaches him: "He who sees with  
his eyes, he is the Self"**. He subtly hints at the object that is behind the  
eye, knowledge, etc, and that is the basis of all these. Without understanding  
this, the two se themselves in a mirror and take the reflection to be the  
Self. You see only the body in the mirror and Virocana comes to the conclusion  
that that is the Self. It is from this idea that atheism, materialism and the  
Lokayata system developed. Although Indra also took this kind of wrong view  
from his reflection, eventually [similar to the story in the Taittriya  
Upanisad of Bhrgu advancing from the sheath of food to the sheath of bliss] he  
goes in gradual stages from the gross body to the subtle body of sleep and  
later to the turiya or fourth state mentioned in the Mandukyopanisad -the  
turiya is the Self.

**KAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas- _The Ten Upanishads_** continued...   
 **The Brhadaranyaka Upanisad comes last. "Brhad" means "great"**. It is  
indeed a great Upanisad, Brhadaranyaka. Generally, an Upanishad comes towards  
the close of the Aranyaka of the sakha concerned. **While the Isavasyopanishad  
occurs in the Samhita of the Sukla-Yajurveda, the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad is  
in the Aranyaka of the same Veda: as a matter of fact the entire Aranyaka  
constitutes this Upanisad.** There are two recensions of it: the Madhyandina  
Sakha and the Kanva Sakha.   
Sankara has chosen the latter for his commentary.   
This Upanisad consists of six chapters. The first two are the "Madhukanda",  
the next two are the "Muni-kanda" in the name of Yajnavalkya, and the last two  
are the "Khilakanda".Madhu may be understood as that which is full of the  
flavour of bliss. If we have the realisation that all this world is a  
personification of the Parabrahman it   
would be sweet like nectar to all creatures - and the creatures would be like  
honey to the world. The Atman then would be nectar for all. This idea is  
expressed in the Madhu-kanda.   
 **It is in this Upanishad that the celebrated statement occurs that the Atman  
is "neither this, nor this" ("Neti, neti"). The Self cannot be described in  
any way. "Na-iti" \- that is "Neti". It is through this process of "Neti,  
neti" that you give up everything - the cosmos, the body, the mind, everything  
- to realise the Self. After knowing the Atman in this manner you will develop  
the attitude that the phenomenal world and all its creatures are made up of  
the same essence of bliss**.   
The first kanda contains the teachings received by the Brahmin Gargya from the  
Ksatriya Ajatasatru. This shows that kings like Ajatasatru and Janaka were  
knowers of the Brahman. We also learn that women too took part on an equal  
footing with the sages in the debates in royal assemblies on the nature of the  
Brahman. There was, for instance, Gargi in Janaka's assembly of the learned.  
The Brhadaranyaka Upanisad also tells us about Yajnavalkya's two wives: of the  
two Katyayani was like any   
housewife and the second, Maitreyi, was a Brahmavadini (one who inquires into  
the Brahman and speaks about it). The instruction given by Yajnavalkya to  
Maitreyi occurs both in the Madhukanda and the Munikanda.   
 **Here we have a beautiful combination of storytelling and philosophical  
disquisition.**   
When Yajnavalkya is on the point of renouncing the world, he divides his  
wealth between his two wives. Katyayani is contented and does not ask for  
anything more. **Maitreyi, on the other hand, is not worried about about her  
share. she tells her husband: "You are leaving your home, aren't you, because  
you wil find greater happiness in sannyasa than from all this wealth? What is  
that happiness? Won't you speak about it?** "   
Yajnavalkya replies: "You have always ben dear to me, Maitreyi. Now, by asking  
this question, you have endeared yourself to me more. " He then proceeds to  
find out what is meant by the idea of someone being dear to someone else. His  
is indeed an inquiry into the concept of love and affection. He says: _" A  
wife is dear to her husband not for the sake of his wife but for the sake of  
his **Self** ( **Atmasya**, he says-Ravi). So is a husband dear to his wife  
for the sake of her Self. The children too are dear to us not for their sake  
but for the sake of the Self. So is the case with our love of wealth. We have  
affection of a person or an entity because it pleases our Self. It means that  
this Self itself is of the nature of affection, of love, of joy. It is to know  
this Self independently of everything else that we forsake all those who are  
dear to us and take to sannyasa. When we know It, the Self or the Atman, we  
will realise that there is nothing other than It. Everything will become dear  
to us. To begin with, when we had affection for certain people or certain  
things, we had dislike for certain other people and certain other things. If  
we cease to be attached to those people or to those things that we loved and  
realise the Atman, then we will become aware that there is nothing other that  
the Atman. Then, again, we will dislike none and will love all without any  
distinction._ "

**KAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas- _The Ten Upanishads_** continued...   
Before renouncing the world, Yajnavalkya held disputations on the Ultimate  
Reality with Kahola, Uddalaka Aruni and Gargi in Janaka's royal assembly.  
These debates, together with the teachings he imparted to Janaka, are included  
in Muni-kanda. **The concept of Antaryamin (Inner Controller) belongs to  
Visistadvaita (qualified non-dualism). The basis for this is to be found in  
Yajnavalkya 's answer to a question put to him by Uddalaka Aruni.**   
According to non-dualism all this phenomenal world in Maya. The idea behind  
the concept of Antaryamin is that if the world is the body, the Paramatman  
dwells in it as its very life. Though Yajnavalkya accepts this concept on a  
certain level, at all other times his views are entirely in consonance with  
non-dualism. **In his concluding words to Maitreyi, the supreme Advaitin that  
he is, Yajnavalkya remarks: "Even if you be little dualistic in your outlook,  
it means that you look at something other than yourself, smell, taste, touch  
and hear something other than yourself. But when you have realised the Self  
experientially, all these 'other things' cease to exist. That which is the  
source of seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, and so on - how can you see,  
hear, taste, smell That? **"   
 **Expounding non-dualism Yajnavalkya tells Janaka (4. 3. 32), "Like water  
mingled with water all become one in the Paramatman. " "He who is freed from  
all desire existes as the Brahman even when he is in the world (with his body)  
and when he dies is united with the Brahman.**   
The two concluding chapters that form the Khila-kanda of the Upanishad bring  
together scattered ideas. ( **If a thing is broken or divided it is called  
"khila". That which is whole and unbroken is "akhila"**. )   
 _A story in the Khila-kanda illustrates how the same teaching is interpreted  
differently according to the degree of maturity of the aspirants. The devas  
(the celestial race), humans and the demons (asuras) seek instruction from  
Prajapati (the Creator). Prajapati utters just one syllable, "Da", as his  
teaching. The devas who do not possess enough control over their senses take  
it to mean "damyata" ("control your senses"). Humans who are possessive  
understand the syllable as "datta" ("give", "be charitable"). The asuras who  
are cruel by nature take the same as "dayadhvam" (be compassionate)_.   
 **A mantra occurring in the concluding part of the Brhadranyaka Upanisad  
seems to me not only extremely interesting but also comforting. What does it  
say? "If a man suffers from fever it must be taken that he is practising  
austerities (tapas). If he recognises illnesses and afflictions to be tapas,  
he passes on to a very high world" **(5. 11. 1). [Etadvai paramam tapo  
yadvyahitastapyate paramam haiva lokam jayati ya evam veda.. . ]   
What is the meaning of this statement and what is interesting about it?   
 **And how is it comforting?   
By observing vows, by fasting, by living an austere life and by suffering  
physically, we will become less attached to the body, and the sins accumulated  
in our past lives will diminish. Tapas is a way of expiating the sins of past  
lives. The offences committed with our body are wiped away by the very body  
when it undergoes suffering (that is by bodily tapas).**   
That is why the Puranas speak of great men having performed austerities.  
Ambika herself - she is the mother of the universe - performs tapas. Not  
heeding the word of her husband Paramesvara, she [as Sati] attends the  
sacrifice conducted by her father Daksa. Because of the humiliation she  
suffers there she immolates herself in the sacrificial fire and is reborn as  
the daughter of Himavan. As atonement for disobeying her husband's command  
during her past life and for the purpose of being united with   
him again, she performs severe austerities. Kalidasa gives a beautiful and  
moving account of this. How bitterly cold it will be during the winter in the  
Himalaya. But in that season Parvati (that is Ambika) performs austerities  
seated on icy rocks or standing on frozen lakes. In the summer, when the sun  
is beating down harshly, she does tapas with fires burning all round her.  
Performing austerities with the fires on four sides and with the sun burning  
above is called "pancagni-tapas".

**KAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas- _The Ten Upanishads_ **continued...   
Many great men have performed such severe austerities.   
How about ourselves? If they, the great men, were guilty of one or two lapses,  
we cannot even keep count of our sins. But we have neither the will nor the  
strength to perform a fraction of the austerities that they went through. How  
then are we going to wipe away our sins?   
It is when we are troubled by such thoughts that we find the foregoing  
Upanisadic mantra comforting. Since ours is not a disciplined life we keep  
suffering from one ailment or another. The Upanisadic mantra seems to be  
directed to us: "You must learn to think that the affliction you are suffering  
from is tapas. If you do so you will be freed from your sins and liberated. "  
Though the message is not given in such plain terms, such is the meaning of  
the mantra.   
We often speak of "jvara-tapa" or "tapa-jvara" (literally "hot fever"). "Tapa"  
means "boiling" or "cooking". The root is "tap" to burn. "Tapana" is one of  
the names of the sun. Even if we do not perform the austerities mentioned in  
the sastras, we must take it that the fever contracted by us is the tapas  
Isvara has awarded us to become free from our sins.   
When we are down with malaria we keep shivering in spite of covering ourselves  
with blankets. Our attitude now must be to suffer the affliction in lieu of  
the tapas we ought to perform in the winter months remaining on snow. Do you  
feel that your body is being roasted when your are suffering from typhoid or  
pneumonia and a running temperature of 105? or 106?F? You must comfort  
yourself, believing that God has given you the fever as a substitute for the  
pancagni-tapas you are unable to   
perform.   
You will in due course learn to take such an attitude and develop the strength  
to suffere any illness. Instead of sending for the doctor or rushing to the  
medicine chest you may take it easy, telling yourself, "Let   
the illness take its course". When we happen to fall ill as a means of   
reducing our burden of sin, is it right to seek a cure for it? Also we save on  
doctor's fees, medicine, etc. **The gain bigger that all the rest in that of  
learning to take the high attitude of treating suffering as not suffering.  
This is called "titiksa"**.   
All this is briefly indicated in the Upanisadic mantra. When we keep lamenting  
that we are unable to expiate our sins - when we are unable to perform tapas -  
we may take comfort from the fact that when we suffer from a disease it is  
God's way of making us perform austerities.   
 **In the last chapter of the Brhadranyaka Upanisad we have strong proof of  
the fact that Vedanta is not opposed to the karmakanda. Here are mentioned the  
pancagnividya and the rites to be performed to beget virtuous children  
(supraja)**.

**KAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas** continued...   
 **What do the Vedas Teach Us?**   
The Vedas speak of a variety of matters. So how are we to accept the view that  
their most important teaching is the concept of Self-realisation expounded in  
the Upanisads constituting the Vedanta? They mention a number of sacrifices  
like agnihotra, somayaga, sattra and ishti and other rituals in addition. Why  
should it not be maintained that it is these that form their chief  
purpose?What are the rites to be performed at a marriage? Or at a funeral? How  
best is a kingdom (or any country) governed? How must we conduct ourselves in  
an assembly? You will find answers to many such questions in the Vedas.  
**Which of these then is the main objective of our scripture?**   
The Vedas tell you about the conduct of sacrifices, ways of worship, and  
methods of meditation. How is the body inspired by the Self? What happens to  
it (the body) in the end? And how does the self imbue the body again? We find  
an answer to such questions in these sacred texts. Also we learn from methods  
to keep the body healthy, the rites to protect ourselves from enemy attacks.  
**What then is the goal of the Vedas? The Upanisads proclaim that all the  
Vedas together point to a single Truth (Kathopanishad, 2. 15) What is that  
Truth? "The Vedas speak in one voice of a Supreme Entity revealing itself as  
the meaning of Omkara. "**   
The Vedas deal with many matters, all of them together speak of one goal, the  
One reality. But the question arises why they concern themselves with  
different entities also when their purpose is only the One entity?   
It is through the various entities, through knowledge of a multiplicity of  
subjects, that we may know of this One Object. Yoga, meditation, austerities,  
sacrifices and other rites, ceremonies like marriage, state affairs, social  
life, poetry: what is the goal of all these? It is the One Reality. And that  
is the goal of the Vedas also. All objects and all entities other than this  
true Object are subject to change. They are like stories remembered and later  
forgotten. (In our ignorance) we do not perceive the One object behind the  
manifoldness of the world. **The Vedas take us to the One Reality through the  
multifarious objects that we do know.To attain this One reality we need to  
discipline our mind in various ways.** Performing sacrifices, practising  
austerities, doing the duties of one's own dharma, building gopurams, digging  
ponds for the public, involving ourselves in social work, samskaras like  
marriage, all these go to purify our consciousness and, finally to still the  
mind that is always agitated(cittavrtti-nirodha). The purpose of different  
works is to help us in our efforts to attain the Brahman.   
"Ved"[from"vid"] means to know. The Upanisads proclaim:" The Atman is that by  
knowing which all can be known. ?The goal of the Vedas is to shed light on  
this Atman. The rituals enjoined on us in their first part and the jnana  
expounded in the second have the same goal-knowing Iswara, the Brahman or the  
Atman. The beginning of the beginning and the end of the end of our scripture  
have the same ultimate aim. **During the "mantrapuspa" ceremony at the time of  
welcoming a great man this mantra is chanted:"Yo Veda dau svarah prokto  
Vedante ca prathisthitah".**   
These words are proof of the words mentioned above. **The mantra means: " What  
is established in the beginning of the Vedas as well as their end is the One  
Truth, the Reality of Isvara. ?**The works associated with the beginning and  
the jnana associated with the end-there is no difference between the goals of  
the two.

**KAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas** continued...   
For the rituals that are divided in a thousand different ways and for the  
knowledge (jnana) that is but one, **the subject is common. That is the Vedas  
have a common subject**. The senses are incapable of perceiving the Self. They  
are aware only of outward objects and keep chasing them. This is mentioned in  
the kathopanisad (4.1). When one's attention is diverted from the object in  
hand we say "parakku parppadu"[in Tami]. **our object is the Self. To be  
diverted from it and to look around-or look away-is to be "paramukha"-it is  
the same as "parakku parppadu".** It is this idea that is expressed by the  
kathopanisad. But the mind does not easily remain fixed   
on our goal. So it is only by performing outward functions that we will gain  
the wisdom and maturity to turn our look inward. We will develop such inner  
vision only by refusing to be dragged down by the mind and the senses, and for  
this we must perform Vedic works.   
 **After learning about, or knowing all other matters by inquiring into them  
and by making an assesment of them, we are enabled to grasp that by knowing  
which we will know everything. That is the reason why the Vedas deal with so  
many branches of learning, so many types of worship, so many different works  
and so many arts and so many social duties. By applying the body in various  
rites we lose consciousness of that very body. By directing our thoughts to  
various branches of learning, by examining various philosophical systems and  
by worshipping various deities the mind and the intellect will in due course  
be dissolved**.   
We are more conscious when we are engaged in evil actions than otherwise. By  
thinking about evil matters the mind becomes coarser. Instead, **if we perform  
Vedic sacraments and worship and chant Vedic mantras for the well-being of the  
world, the desires of the body and the mind will wilt. Eventually, we will  
develop the maturity and the wisdom to gain inner vision. In this way we will  
obtain release here itself ( "ihaiva") Release from what? From samsara, from  
the cycle of birth and death.**   
When we realise that the body and the mind are not"we" and when we become free  
from them-as mentioned in the Upanisads- we are liberated from worldly  
existence.   
The purpose of the Vedas is achieving liberation in this world itself. And  
that is their glory. Other religions promise a man salvation after his  
departure for another world. But we cannot have any idea of that type of  
deliverance. Those who have attained will not return to this world to tell us  
about it. So we may have doubts about it or may not believe it at all. **But  
the Vedas hold out the ideals of liberation here itself if we renounce all  
desire and keep meditating on the Self. Moksa then will be within our grasp at  
once. There is no room for doubt in this**.

**KAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas -Veda-bhasya**   
The sound of the Vedas must be kept alive. For this purpose, it would be  
enough if Brahmins memorized the mantras and chanted them every day. The power  
of the sound, the power of the mantras vocalised, is sufficient to bring good  
to mankind. **I said, you will remember, that chanting the Vedas with faith,  
even though without knowing their meaning, is?viryavattaram ". The statement,  
however, does not fully reflect my view.**   
A student will have to spend many years to memorise the Vedas and study their  
meaning. It is not easy to keep him confined to the Vedic school for such a  
long time. I must explain here why I said that " it is not necessary to know  
the meaning of the Vedas and their sound is all we need". To insist that a  
student should chant the Vedas only if he knows the meaning of the mantras is  
expecting too much of him. It might also mean that nobody would come forward  
even to memorize the hymns. In that case how will their sound be kept alive?  
**That is why I said, half seriously and half sportingly, that ?the meaning is  
not necessary, the sound would be sufficient.. . . ".**   
There must indeed be a large number of people who can chant the Vedas and keep  
their sound alive. In addition, there must be a system by which some of them  
at least will be taught their meaning. That is how we have come to be  
seriously involved in teaching the Veda-bhasya (commentary on the Vedas). It  
is because the Vedas are profound in their import that a number of great men  
have commented upon them. Their efforts must not go in vain.   
We perform a number of rites in our home: marriage, sraddha, upakarma, and so  
on, and during these functions we chant Vedic mantras as instructed by the  
priest. By the grace of Isvara we have not reached the unfortunate state of  
totally discarding such rites. However, there is a declining trend, a  
weakening of Vedic practices. **One important reason for this is that we do  
not know the meaning of the mantras chanted.** Educated people nowadays have  
no true involvement in rites in which   
they have to repeat the mantras after the priest without knowing the meaning.   
We cannot expect to convince people that the chanting of the mantras (even  
without knowing their meaning) is beneficial. The hymns for each function are  
different and also different in significance. If we appreciate this fact, we  
will realise that there is a scientific basis for them. Besides, they have an  
emotional appeal which willl be evident only when we know their meaning. So to  
know the meaning of the mantras is to have greater involvement in the  
functions in which they are chanted. That is the reason why the mouthing of  
syllables purposelessly has come to be [irreverently] likened to the chanting  
of ?sraddha mantras". **The meaning of the mantras (including those chanted at  
sraddhas) must be understood by the priest as well as by the performer of the  
rites; we must evolve a scheme for this purpose**.   
 **First the priest himself must know the meaning of the mantras and the  
significance of the rituals at which he officiates. Today the majority of  
priests are ignorant of the meaning of what they chant. If a karta or a  
yajamana (the man on whose behalf a rite is conducted) asks his priest, ?What  
does this mean? ", the latter is unable to give an answer. How would you then  
expect the karta to have faith in the rites?**   
I believe that many middle-aged people today are keen to know the meaning of  
the mantras. I also think that if they tend to lose faith in rituals it is  
because they have to repeat parrot-like the hymns chanted by the priest. **So  
we are making efforts to ensure that those who officiate at rituals (the  
upadhyayas) accquire proficiency in Veda-bhasya to enable them to explain the  
meaning of the mantras**.

**THE VEDAS**   
By SRI SWAMI SIVANANDA   
 **SANSKRIT LITERATURE**   
Sanskrit literature can be classified under six orthodox heads and four  
secular heads. The six orthodox sections form the authoritative scriptures of  
the Hindus. The four secular sections embody the latter developments in  
classical Sanskrit literature.   
The six scriptures are: (i) Srutis, (ii) Smritis, (iii) Itihasas, (iv)  
Puranas, (v) Agamas and (vi) Darsanas.   
The four secular writings are: (i) Subhashitas, (ii) Kavyas, (iii) Natakas and  
(iv) Alankaras.   
 **VEDA-THE REVEALED WISDOM**   
The Srutis are called the Vedas, or the Amnaya. The Hindus have received their  
religion through revelation, the Vedas. These are direct intuitional  
revelations and are held to be Apaurusheya or entirely superhuman, without any  
author in particular. The Veda is the glorious pride of the Hindus, nay, of  
the whole world!   
The term Veda comes from the root 'Vid', to know. The word Veda means  
knowledge. When it is applied to scripture, it signifies a book of knowledge.  
The Vedas are the foundational scriptures of the Hindus. The Veda is the  
source of the other five sets of scriptures, why, even of the secular and the  
materialistic. The Veda is the storehouse of Indian wisdom and is a memorable  
glory which man can never forget till eternity.   
The Vedas are the eternal truths revealed by God to the great ancient Rishis  
of India. The word Rishi means a Seer, from dris, to see. He is the Mantra-  
Drashta, seer of Mantra or thought. The thought was not his own. The Rishis  
saw the truths or heard them. Therefore, the Vedas are what are heard (Sruti).  
The Rishi did not write. He did not create it out of his mind. He was the seer  
of thought which existed already. He was only the spiritual discoverer of the  
thought. He is not the inventor of the Veda.   
 **THE UNIQUE GLORY OF THE VEDAS**   
The Vedas represent the spiritual experiences of the Rishis of yore. The Rishi  
is only a medium or an agent to transmit to people the intuitional experiences  
which he received. The truths of the Vedas are revelations. All the other  
religions of the world claim their authority as being delivered by special  
messengers of God to certain persons, but the Vedas do not owe their authority  
to any one. They are themselves the authority as they are eternal, as they are  
the Knowledge of the Lord.   
Lord Brahma, the Creator, imparted the divine knowledge to the Rishis or  
Seers. The Rishis disseminated the knowledge. The Vedic Rishis were great  
realised persons who had direct intuitive perception of Brahman or the Truth.  
They were inspired writers. They built a simple, grand and perfect system of  
religion and philosophy from which the founders and teachers of all other  
religions have drawn their inspiration.   
The Vedas are the oldest books in the library of man. The truths contained in  
all religions are derived from the Vedas and are ultimately traceable to the  
Vedas. The Vedas are the fountain-head of religion. The Vedas are the ultimate  
source to which all religious knowledge can be traced. Religion is of divine  
origin. It was revealed by God to man in the earliest times. It is embodied in  
the Vedas.   
The Vedas are eternal. They are without beginning and end. An ignorant man,  
may say how a book can be without beginning or end. By the Vedas, no books are  
meant. Vedas came out of the breath of the Lord. They are not the composition  
of any human mind. They were never written, never created. They are eternal  
and impersonal. The date of the Vedas has never been fixed. It can never be  
fixed. Vedas are eternal spiritual truths. Vedas are an embodiment of divine  
knowledge. The books may be destroyed, but the knowledge cannot be destroyed.  
Knowledge is eternal. In that sense, the Vedas are eternal.   
 **DIVISIONS OF THE VEDAS**   
The Veda is divided into four great books: the Rig-Veda, the Yajur-Veda, the  
Sama-Veda and the Atharva-Veda. The Yajur-Veda is again divided into two  
parts, the Sukla and the Krishna. The Krishna or the Taittiriya is the older  
book and the Sukla or the Vajasaneya is a later revelation to sage Yajnavalkya  
from the resplendent Sun-God.   
The Rig-Veda is divided into twenty-one sections, the Yajur-Veda into one  
hundred and nine sections, the Sama-Veda into one thousand sections and the  
Atharva-Veda into fifty sections. In all, the whole Veda is thus divided into  
one thousand one hundred and eighty recensions.   
Each Veda consists of four parts: the Mantra-Samhitas or hymns, the Brahmanas  
or explanations of Mantras or rituals, the Aranyakas, and the Upanishads. The  
division of the Vedas into four parts is to suit the four stages in a man's  
life.   
The Mantra-Samhitas are hymns in praise of the Vedic God for attaining  
material prosperity here and happiness hereafter. They are metrical poems  
comprising prayers, hymns and incantations addressed to various deities, both  
subjective and objective. The Mantra portion of the Vedas is useful for the  
Brahmacharins.   
The Rig-Veda Samhita is the grandest book of the Hindus, the oldest and the  
best. It is the Great Indian Bible, which no Hindu would forget to adore from  
the core of his heart. Its style, the language and the tone are most beautiful  
and mysterious. Its immortal Mantras embody the greatest truths of existence,  
and it is perhaps the greatest treasure in all the scriptural literature of  
the world. Its priest is called the Hotri.   
The Yajur-Veda Samhita is mostly in prose and is meant to be used by the  
Adhvaryu, the Yajur-Vedic priest, for superfluous explanations of the rites in  
sacrifices, supplementing the Rig-Vedic Mantras.   
The Sama-Veda Samhita is mostly borrowed from the Rig-Vedic Samhita, and is  
meant to be sung by the Udgatri, the Sama Vedic priest, in sacrifices.   
The Atharva-Veda Samhita is meant to be used by the Brahma, the Atharva-Vedic  
priest, to correct the mispronunciations and wrong performances that may  
accidentally be committed by the other three priests of the sacrifice.   
The Brahmana portions guide people to perform sacrificial rites. They are  
prose explanations of the method of using the Mantras in the Yajna or the  
sacrifice. The Brahmana portion is suitable for the householders.   
There are two Brahmanas to the Rig-Veda-the Aitareya and the Sankhayana. "The  
Rig-Veda", says Max Muller, "is the most ancient book of the world. The sacred  
hymns of the Brahmanas stand unparalleled in the literature of the whole  
world; and their preservation might well be called miraculous."   
The Satapatha Brahmana belongs to the Sukla-Yajur-Veda. The Krishna-Yajur-Veda  
has the Taittiriya and the Maitrayana Brahmanas. The Tandya or Panchavimsa,  
the Shadvimsa, the Chhandogya, the Adbhuta, the Arsheya and the Upanishad  
Brahmanas belong to the Sama-Veda. The Brahmana of the Atharva-Veda is called  
the Gopatha. Each of the Brahmanas has got an Aranyaka.   
The Aranyakas are the forest books, the mystical sylvan texts which give  
philosophical interpretations of the rituals. The Aranyakas are intended for  
the Vanaprasthas or hermits who prepare themselves for taking Sannyasa.   
The Upanishads are the most important portion of the Vedas. The Upanishads  
contain the essence or the knowledge portion of the Vedas. The philosophy of  
the Upanishads is sublime, profound, lofty and soul-stirring. The Upanishads  
speak of the identity of the individual soul and the Supreme Soul. They reveal  
the most subtle and deep spiritual truths. The Upanishads are useful for the  
Sannyasins.   
The subject matter of the whole Veda is divided into Karma- Kanda, Upasana-  
Kanda and Jnana-Kanda. The Karma-Kanda or Ritualistic Section deals with  
various sacrifices and rituals. The Upasana-Kanda or Worship-Section deals  
with various kinds of worship or meditation. The Jnana-Kanda or Knowledge-  
Section deals with the highest knowledge of Nirguna Brahman. The Mantras and  
the Brahmanas constitute Karma-Kanda; the Aranyakas Upasana-Kanda; and the  
Upanishads Jnana-Kanda.   
 **THE ESSENCE OF THE VEDAS**   
Live in the spirit of the teachings of the Vedas. Learn to discriminate  
between the permanent and the impermanent. Behold the Self in all beings, in  
all objects. Names and forms are illusory. Therefore sublate them. Feel that  
there is nothing but the Self. Share what you have,-physical, mental, moral or  
spiritual,-with all. Serve the Self in all. Feel when you serve others, that  
you are serving your own Self. Love thy neighbour as thyself. Melt all  
illusory differences. Remove all barriers that separate man from man. Mix with  
all. Embrace all. Destroy the sex-idea and body-idea by constantly thinking of  
the Self or the sexless, bodiless Atman. Fix the mind on the Self when you  
work. This is the essence of the teachings of the Vedas and sages of yore.  
This is real, eternal life in Atman. Put these things in practice in the daily  
battle of life. You will shine as a dynamic Yogi or a Jivanmukta. There is no  
doubt of this.

 **To Discover The One Truth**   
 **All Vedas have one common goal though there are differences among their  
adherents. What is the goal? It is the well-being of the entire world and all  
creatures living in it, and the uplift of the Self of each one of us and its  
everlasting union with the Ultimate Reality**.   
 **We may take pride in the Vedas for another reason also. They do not point  
to a single way and proclaim, "This alone is the path" nor do they affirm,  
"This is the only God" with reference to their own view of the Supreme Being.  
Instead, they declare that, if one adheres to any path with faith or worships  
any deity with devotion, one will be led towards the Truth. The scripture of  
no other religion speaks thus of the many paths to liberation. On the  
contrary, each of them insists that the way shown by it alone will lead to  
liberation. The Vedas alone give expression to the high-minded view that  
different people may take different paths to discover the one and only  
Truth**.(This is exactly what Sri Ramakrishna has also said and demonstrated  
in his wonderful life-Ravi)

**kAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedAs** continued....   
 **Brahmana and Aranyaka**   
So far, in speaking of the Vedas, I have dealt mainly with the Samhita part of  
each sakha or recension. We have already seen that the Samhitas are the main  
text of the Vedas. Apart from them, each sakha has a Brahmana and an Aranyaka.   
The Brahmana lays down the various rites - karma - to be performed and  
explains the procedure for the same. It interprets the words of the mantras  
occuring in the Samhita, how they are to be understood in the conduct of  
sacrifices. The Brahmanas constitute a guide for the conduct of yajnas.   
The word "Aranyaka" is derived from "aranya". You must have heard of places  
like "Dandakaranya" and "Vedaranya". "Aranya"means a "forest". **Neither in  
the Samhita nor in the Brahmana is one urged to go and live in a forest. Vedic  
rites like sacrifices are to be preformed by the householder (grhastha) living  
in a village. But after his mind is rendered pure through such rites, he goes  
to a forest as a recluse to engage himself in meditation. It is to qualify for  
this stage of vanaprastha, to become inwardly pure and mellow, that Vedic  
practices like sacrifices are to be followed**.   
 **The Aranyakas prepare one for one 's stage in life as an anchorite**.  
**They expound the concepts inherent in the mantras** of the Samhitas and the  
rites detailed in the Brahmanas. **In other words, they explain the hidden  
meaning of the Vedas, their metaphorical passages. Indeed, they throw light on  
the esoteric message of our scripture. For the Aranyakas, more important than  
the performance of sacrifices,is the awareness of their inner meaning and  
significance**. According to present-day scholars, the Aranyakas incorporate  
the metaphorical passages representing the metaphysical inquires conducted by  
the inmates of forest hermitages.   
 **The Brhadaranyaka Upanishad, as its very name suggests, is both an Aranyaka  
and an Upanishad, and it begins with a philosophical explanation of the horse  
sacrifice**.

**kAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedAs** continued....   
 **The Upanisads**   
 **The Upanisads come at the close of the Aranyakas. If the Samhita is the  
tree, the Brahmana the flower and the Aranyaka the fruit (i. e. in its unripe  
stage), the Upanishads are the mellow fruit - the final fruit or "phala". The  
Upanisads are to the seeker the direct means of realising the non-difference  
between the jivatman (individual self) and the Paramatman. The purpose of the  
Samhita and the Aranyaka is to take us to this path of knowledge. Though a  
number of deities are mentioned here and there in the Upanisads, the chief  
objective of these texts is inquiry into the Ultimate Reality and the  
attainment of the stage in which one becomes wise enough and mature enough to  
sever oneself from all karma. It is on this basis that the Vedas are divided  
into the karmakanda and the jnanakanda, the part dealing with works and the  
part dealing with knowledge [enlightenment]. The two are also spoken of as the  
Purvamimamsa and the Uttaramimamsa respectively**.(We will later on see how  
the mahaswami unifies everything in his wonderful and insightful way-Ravi)   
The great sage Jaimini's sastra based on his inquiry into the karmakanda is  
called Purvamimamsa. His teaching is that the karmakanda, constituting the  
Vedic rites and duties, is itself the final fruit of the scripture.  
Similiarly, Vyasa has in his work, the Brahmasutra, inquired into the  
jnanakanda and come to the conclusion that it represents the ultimate purpose  
of the Vedas. The Upanisadic jnanakanda is small compared to the karmakanda.  
The Jaiminisutra has a thousand sections ("sahasradhikarani"), while Vyasa's  
Brahmasutra has only 192 sections.   
 **Just as the leaves of a tree far outnumber its flowers and fruits, in the  
case of the Vedic tree the karmakanda is far bigger than the jnanakanda**.   
In other countries philosophers try to apprehend the Truth on an intellectual  
plane. The Upanisadic inquiry is differnt, its purpose being to realise  
inwardly the Truth perceived by the mind or the intellect. Is it enough to  
know that halva is sweet? You must experience its sweetness by eating it.  
**How are the Upanisads different from other philosophical systems? They (the  
Upanisads) consist of mantras, sacred syllables, and their sound is instinct  
with power. This power transforms the truths   
propounded by them into an inward reality**. The philosophical systems of  
other countries do not go beyond making an intellectual inquiry. **Here, in  
the Vedas   
-in the karmakanda - a way of life is prescribed for the seeker with actions and duties calculated to discipline and purify him. After leading such a life and eventually forsaking all action, all Vedic karma, he meditates on the truths of the Upanisads. Instead of being mere ideas of intellectual perception, these truths will then become a living reality. The highest of these truths is that there is no differnce between the individual self and the Brahman**.   
 **It is to attain this highest of states in which the individual self  
dissolves inseperably in the Brahman that a man becomes a sannyasin after  
forsaking the very karma that gives him inward maturity. When he is initiated  
into sannyasa he is taught four mantras, the four [principal] mahakavyas. The  
four proclaim the identity of the individual self(jivatman) with the Brahman.  
When these mahavakyas are reflected upon through the method known as  
"nididhyasana", the seeker will arrive at the stage of realising the oneness  
of the individual self and the Brahman**.   
 **The four mahavakyas occur in four differnt Upanisads**. Many are the rites  
that you have to perform, many are the prayers you have to recite and many are  
the ways of life you are enjoined to follow - all these according to the  
Samhitas and Brahmanas. But, when it comes to achieving the highest ideal, the  
supreme goal of man, you have no alternative to the Upanisads and their  
mahavakyas.

**kAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedAs : **The Upanisads** continued...   
"The Brahman means realising the jnana that is the highest" ( **Prajnanam  
Brahma** ): this mahavakya occurs in the Aitareya Upanisad of the Rgveda.   
"I am the Brahman" ( **Aham Brahmasmi)** is the mahavakya belonging to the  
Brhadaranyaka Upanisad of the Yajurveda.   
"That thou art" or "the Paramatman and you are the one and the same" ( **Tat  
tvam asi** ) is from the Chandogya Upanisad of the samaveda.   
The fourth mahavakya, "This Self is the Brahman" ( **Ayam Atma Brahma** ), is  
from the Mandukya Upanisad of the Atharvaveda.   
 **In his Sopana Pancaka, which contains the sum and the substance of his  
teachings, the Acharya(Sri Sankara) urges us to chant the Samhitas (of the  
Vedas), perform the duties laid down in the Brahmanas and, finally, to  
meditate on the mahavakyas after recieving initiation into them, the purpose  
being recognizing our oneness with Brahman**.   
The Vedas find their final expression in the Upanisads. Indeed, the Upanisads  
are called "Vedanta". They form the final part of the Vedas in two ways. In  
each recension we have first the Samhita, then the Brahmana which is followed  
by the Aranyaka, the Upanisad coming at the close of the last-mentioned. T  
**he Upanisads throw light on the meaning and the purpose of the Vedas and  
represent the end of the scripture in more than one sense: while their text  
forms the concluding part of the Vedas, their meaning represents the Ultimate  
Truth of the same**. **A village or town has a temple; the temple has its  
gopuram; and the gopuram has a sikhara over it. The Upanisads are the sikhara,  
the summit, of our philosophical [and metaphysical] system**.   
"Upa-ni-sad" means to "sit near by". The Upanisads are the teachings imparted  
by a guru to his student sitting by his side [sitting at his feet]. You could  
also take the term to mean "that which takes one to the Brahman". "Upanayana"  
may be interpreted in two ways: leading a child to his guru; or leading him to  
the Brahman. Similiarly, the term Upanisad could also be understood in the  
above two senses. If a student sits close to the teacher when he is recieving  
instruction it means that a "rahasya" (a secret or a mystery) is being  
conveyed to him.   
 **Such teachings are not meant to be imparted to those who are not  
sufficiently mature and who are not capable of cherishing their value.   
That is why in the Upanisads themselves these words occur where subtle and  
esoteric truths are expounded:"This is Upanisad. This is Upanisad"  
(ityupanishad,ityupanishad-Ravi) What is held to be a secret in the Vedas is  
called a "rahasya". In the Upanisads the term "Upanisad" is itself used to  
mean the same**.

**kAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedAs** continued...   
 **The Brahmasutra**   
I said that every doctrine or system has a sutra (text consisting of  
aphoristic statements), a bhasya (commentary) and a vartika (elucidation of  
the commentary). The systems founded by Sankara, Ramanuja, Madhva, Srikantha  
(acarya of Saiva-Sidhanta) belong to Vedanta. All these acaryas cite the  
authority of the Vedas in support of their respective doctrines and they have  
chosen the same ten Upanisads to comment upon according to their different  
philosophical perceptions.   
The Upanisads are not in the form of sutras; yet for the Vedantic system they  
must be regarded as having the same "place" (or force) as the sutras.   
 **How is a sutra to be understood? It must state truths in an extremely terse  
form. What is expressed in the least possible number of words to convey an  
idea or truth is a sutra, an aphorism**. According to this definition the  
Upanisads cannot be said to be sutras. However, there does exist a basic text  
for all Vedantic schools in the form of sutras. This is the Brahmasutra.   
In the Brahmasutra, on which there are commentaries according to the various  
philosophical schools, Vyasa presents in an extremely terse form the substance  
of the ten (principal) Upanisads. Since he dwelt under the badari tree  
(jujube) he came to be called "Badarayana" and his work became well-known as  
"Badarayana-sutra". Who or **what is man (the individual self)? What is the  
nature of the world (jagat) in which he lives? And what is the truth  
underlying all this? The Brahmasutra, which is a   
basic text of all Vedantic schools, seeks to answer these fundamental  
questions. Vyasa does not project his personal views in his work. All he does  
is to make a penetrating study of the science of Vedanta that is already  
constituted by the Upanisads**. Since it is an inquiry into the Upanisads  
which form the latter part of the Vedas, the Brahmasutra is called  
"Uttaramimamsa"   
There are 555 sutras in the Brahmasutra which is divided into four chapters,  
each consisting of four padas (or "feet"). Altogether there are 192 sections  
or "adhikaranas" in it. **The Brahmasutra is also called "Bhiksu-sutra" since  
it deals with sannyasa, the final goal of the seeker. And, because it is all  
about the Self in the body, it has another name, "Sariraka"**.   
 **" Sutra" literally means a rope or string**. The word occurs in the term  
"mangala-sutra", the thread worn by the bride at her wedding. Keeping the  
meaning of thread or string in mind, our Acarya has made a pun on the word in  
his commentary: "Vedanta-vakya-kusuma-grathanarthatvat sutranam". If the  
flowers that are Upanisads in the tree called the Vedas are strewn all over  
the earth, how can we gather them to make a garland? **Our Acarya remarks that  
in the Brahmasutra the flowers of the   
Upanisads are strung together to form a garland**.   
 **All Hindu philosophical systems are based on the Brahmasutra, but the  
Brahmasutra itself is based on the Upanisads. That is why it has become  
customary to describe all Vedic schools of thought as "Upanisadic systems**".  
When Westerners keep extolling our philosophy, chanting, "Vedanta! Vedanta!?  
they have in mind the Upanisads. If a person turns against the petty pleasures  
of this world and makes a remark suggestive of jnana, people tell him, "Arre,  
are you mouthing Vedanta? "   
 **If the Vedas were personified as Purusa, the Upanisads would be his head or  
crown. That is why these texts are called "Sruti-siras"**.

**kAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedAs** continued...   
 **Veda and Vedanta: Are They Opposed to One Another?**   
 **The rituals mentioned in the karmakanda of the Vedas are sought to be  
negated in the jnanakanda which is also part of the same scripture**. While  
the karmakanda enjoins upon you the worship of various deities and lays down  
rules for the same, the jnanakanda constituted by the Upanisads ridicules the  
worshipper of deities as a dim-witted person no better than a beast.   
This seems strange, the latter part of the Vedas contradicting the former  
part. The first part deals throughout with karma, while the second or  
concluding part is all about jnana. **Owing to this difference, people have  
gone so far as to divide our scripture into two sections: the Vedas (that is  
the first part) to mean the karmakanda and the Upanisads (Vedanta) to mean the  
jnanakanda**.   
 **Vedanta it is that Lord teaches us in the Gita and in it he lashes out  
against the karmakanda**. It is generally believed that the Buddha and  
Mahavira were the first to attack the Vedas. It is not so. **Sri Krishna  
Paramatman himself spoke against them long before these two religious leaders.  
At one place in the Gita he says to Arjuna: "The Vedas are associated with the  
three qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas. You must transcend these three  
qualities. Full of desire, they (the practitioners of Vedic rituals) long for  
paradise and keep thinking of pleasures and material prosperity. They are born  
again and again and their minds are never fixed in samadhi, these men clinging  
to Vedic rituals**.   
**In another passage Sri Krishna declares: "Not by the Vedas am I to be  
realised, nor by sacrifices nor by much study. . . . **?   
 **Does not such talk contradict all that I have spoken so far about the  
Vedas, that they are the source of all our dharma?**   
 **With some thinking we will realise that there is in fact no contradiction.  
Would it be possible for us, in our present condition, to go beyond the three  
gunas even to the slightest extent and realise the true state of the Self  
spoken of in the Upanisads? The purpose of the Vedic rituals is to take us, by  
degrees, to this state. So long as we believe that the world is real we  
worship the deities so as to be vouchsafed happiness. And this world, which we  
think is real, is also benefited by such worship**.   
Thinking the deities to be real, we help them and in return we are helped by  
them. Living happily on this earth we long to go to the world of the  
celestials and enjoy the pleasures of paradise. So far so good. **But if we  
stopped at this stage would it not mean losing sight of our supreme objective?  
Is not this objective, this goal, our becoming one with the Paramatman? Would  
it not be foolish to ignore this great ideal of ours and still cling to  
mundane happiness?**   
In our present state of immaturity it is not possible to think of the world  
being unreal. Recognising this, the Vedas provide us the rituals to be  
performed for happiness in this world. Because of our inadequacies we are  
unable to devote ourselves to a formless Paramatman from whom we are not  
different. So the Vedas have devised a system in which a number of deities are  
worshipped. But, in course of time, as we perform the rituals and worship the  
deities, we must make efforts to advance to the   
state of wisdom and enlightenment in which the world will be seen to be unreal  
and the rites will become unnecessary. Instead of worshipping many deities, we  
must reach the state in which we will recognise that we have no existence  
other than that of our being dissolved in the Paramatman. **We must perform  
Vedic sacraments with the knowledge that they prepare us to go to this state  
by making our mind pure and onepointed**.   
If we perform rituals with the sole idea of worldly happiness and carry on  
trade with the celestials by conducting sacrifices (offering them oblations  
and receiving benefits from them in return), we will never come face to face  
with the Truth. Even if we go to the world of the celestials, we will not be  
blessed with Self realisation. Our residence in paradise is commensurate with  
the merit we earn here and is not permanent. Sooner or later we will have to  
return to this world and be in the womb of a mother. **The ritual worship and  
other sacraments of the Vedas are to some extent the result of making an  
adjustment to our present immature state of mind. But their real purpose is to  
take us forward gradually from this very immature state and illumine us  
within. It would be wrong to refuse to go beyond the stage of ritual  
worship**.

If, to begin with, it is not right to refuse all at once to perform Vedic  
rites, it would be equally not right, subsequently, to refuse to give them up.  
**Nowadays, people are averse to ritual to start with itself. "What? " they  
exclaim. "Who wants to perform sacrifices? Why should we chant the Vedas? Let  
us go directly to the Upanisads**".   
 **Some of them can speak eloquently about the Upanisads from a mere  
intellectual understanding of them. But none has the inward experience of the  
truths propounded in them and we do not see them emerging as men of detachment  
with a true awareness of the Self. The reason for this is that they have not  
prepared themselves for this higher state of perception through the  
performance of rituals**.   
**If this is wrong in one sense, refusal to take the path of jnana from that  
of karma is equally not justifiable**. If one has to qualify for the B. A.  
degree one has to begin at the beginning - one has to progress from the first  
standard all the way to the degree course. One cannot naturally join the B. A.  
class without qualifying for it.   
 **At the same time, is it not absurd to remain all the time as a failure in  
the first standard itself?**   
 **In the old days there were many people belonging to the latter category  
(that is people who refused to take the path of knowledge and wished to remain  
wedded to the path of karma). Now people belonging to the former category  
predominate (that is those who want to take the path of jnana, without being  
prepared for it through karma). During the time of Sri Krsna also the majority  
clung to rituals. His criticism is directed against them, against those who  
perform Vedic sacraments without   
understanding their purpose and who fail to go beyond them**. Unfortunately,  
this is mistaken for criticism of the Vedas themselves. **The Lord could never  
have attacked the Vedas per se. After all, it was to save them that he  
descended to earth again and again**.   
In keeping with his times, Krsna Paramatman spoke against people who confined  
themselves to the narrow path of karma.   
Graduating to the Upanisads without being prepared for them through the  
performance of Vedic rites is a greater offence than failure to go along the  
path of jnana from that of karma. After all, to repeat what I said before, on  
has to go through the primary and secondary stages of education before  
qualifying for admission to college. **The man who insists on being admitted  
to the B. A. class without qualifying for it is not amenable to any  
suggestion. The one who wants to remain in the first standard learns at least  
something; the other type is incapable of learning anything**.   
 **The Vedas and Vedanta are not at variance with one another. The karmakanda  
prepares us for Vedanta or the jananakanda**. The former has to do with this  
world and with many deities and its adherents are subject to the three gunas.  
But it is the first step to go beyond the three gunas and the sever oneself  
from worldly existence. **If we perform the rites laid down in the karmakanda,  
keeping in mind their true purpose, we shall naturally be qualifying for the  
jnanakanda**.

**kAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedAs - _Veda and Vedanta: Are They Opposed to One

Some questions arise here. The sound of the Vedas and the sacrifices benefit  
not only the person who chants the Vedas and performs the sacrifices but all  
creatures. If such a man (that is like the one who learns the Vedas and  
conducts sacrifices) renounces the world thinking it to be unreal and becomes  
a jnanin, what will happen to the world, to its welfare? Even if you think  
that the world is unreal, it is real in the sense that it is the cause of so  
much suffering. The jnanin does not perform any rites like sacrifices so as to  
rid the world of its troubles. Who will then work for the welfare of the  
world?   
The answer: the jnanin is an exalted state of awareness and while being in it  
he does not have to perform any sacrifices or other rites to ensure the good  
of the world. His life itself is a sacrifice, a yagna, and through him the  
world will receive the Lord's blessings even if he looks upon it as unreal or  
a "sport" of the Supreme Being. Whey do people flock to a jnanin? Why do they  
fall at his feet even if he keeps himself aloof from them? It is because they  
receive his grace. Whether or not he wants to   
give any blessings, the Lord's grace flows into this world through him. In his  
very presence people feel tranquil and, sometimes, even their worldly desires  
are satisfied. A jnanin who realises within that there is no deity apart from  
himself can give his blessings in greater measure than the deities themselves.  
So it is wrong to think that, since he does not perform sacrifices, he does  
not do anything for the good of the world.

**Kanchi mahAswAmi on the Vedas - _Veda and Vedanta: Are They Opposed to One

All rituals, all worship, are meant to make a man aware of the Reality.  
Varnasrama with its one hundred thousand differences and with its countless  
stipulations as to who can do what is a preliminary arrangement to arrive at  
the stage in which there is a oneness of all, with all the differences  
banished. If we fail to go beyond the stage of karma, observing all the  
differences of varnasrama, we shall be committing a wrong. Krsna Paramatman  
directs his criticism against those who claim that the karmakanda of the Vedas  
alone matters, that the jnanakanda does not serve any purpose. In doing so he  
seems to attack the Vedas themselves. **In reality he faults those who are, in  
his words, "Veda-vadaratah", those who are deceived by flowery accounts of the  
Vedas without realising their true meaning and those who do not exert  
themselves to   
rise to the level of experiential jnana**.   
To start with, we must perform the rites prescribed by the Vedas. But in this  
there must be the realisation that they are but steps leading us to the higher  
state in which we will ultimately find bliss in our Self, a state in which  
there will be neither rites nor duties to perform. **Similarly, to start with,  
the deities must be worshipped but again with the conviction that such worship  
serves the ultimate purpose of arriving at the point where we will recognise  
that the worshipper and the worshipped are one.** **Thus, to begin with, all  
differences in functions must be recognised and life lived according to  
them**. Different divisions of people have different duties, and the customs  
and rites assigned to each are such as to help them in the proper discharge of  
those duties. But in the very process of maintaining such differences there  
must be the conviction within that ultimately there are no differences, that  
all are one.   
If the Vedas are to be learned and chanted and if the Vedic rituals are to be  
practiced - and the Vedas must be learned and chanted even as the Vedic  
rituals must be practiced - it is because in this way we shall be led to that  
supreme experience of the Reality in which there will be no need for these  
very Vedas. First the flowers, and from them the fruit. Though the flower  
looks beautiful, the fruit emerges only when it wilts or falls to earth. **A  
tree does not fruit before it flowers. In the same way, to plunge into Vedanta  
without first going through a life of Vedic discipline is neither wise nor in  
keeping with reality. It is equally wrong to remain confined to the karmakanda  
and refuse to make an effort to acquire Vedantic knowledge: it is like wishing  
that we must have only flowers and no fruits. There must be a sense of  
balance, a sense of proportion, in everything we do**.   
 **There is a passage in the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad similar to that in the  
Gita: "He who becomes aware of the nature of the Atman - for him the Vedas  
will no longer be Vedas, the gods will cease to be gods, Brahmins will no  
longer be, Brahmins.. . . . . . **".

However, in the karmakanda itself there is criticism of the view that rituals  
are all and they are the ultimate goal. Sri Krsna declares in the Gita that it  
is laudable to perform the many sacrifices mentioned in the Vedas realising  
their true purpose ("Evam bahuvidha yajna vitata Brahmano mukhe"). However,  
all these sacraments have their culmination in jnana ("Sarvam karm'akhilam

 **The same idea is expressed forcefully through an illustration in the Vedic  
karmakanda itself** : **" He who performs only rituals, without wakening to  
Isvara feeds the fire to raise the smoke and nothing else**" (Taittiriya  
Kathakam, first prasna, last anuvaka, fourth vakya). If you feed the fire with  
firewood you must keep the pot over it to cook rice. ' **One who does not  
exert oneself to be "cooked" in jnana is like the man who lights the kitchen  
fire without keeping the cooking pot on it**'. This is what the Vedas say.  
What purpose is served by building a big sacrificial fire if you do not offer  
the oblations in it? The result will be only smoke and more smoke. A sacrifice  
must be performed with the consciousness that you are offering the fruit of  
your karma itself as an oblation. Otherwise there will be nothing but smoke.   
" **The Self must be offered as an oblation in the fire of the Brahman. All  
sensual pleasures must be offered in the fire of self-control. The five vital  
breaths must be given over in sacrifice in one another ", says the Gita. Vedic  
sacrifices involving materials and works have this goal. A man may perform any  
number of sacrifices but he would be a fool to perform them without realising  
this truth**. **The Vedas too say that such a man in unintelligent**. What do  
you expect his buddhi (intuitive intelligence) to become?It would also be like  
the smoke of the sacrificial fire that darkens everything in its course and  
ends up in nothing.   
 **When Vedic rites are performed in a spirit of dedication to Isvara they  
will loosen your ties little by little, instead of keeping you bound to this  
world. If you perform rites to please the Lord, without expecting any reward,  
your mind will be cleansed and you will transcend the three gunas. This is the  
meaning and purpose of "yajna"**. Is not the word understood in English as  
"sacrifice"? "Yaga" also means sacrifice, "tyaga". **When an offering is  
placed in the fire we say "na mama" ("not mine"): it is this attitude of self-  
denial that is the life and soul of a sacrificial rite. Is it possible to  
retrieve what has been offered in the fire? Even if it were, it would soon  
disintegrate. In this way you must reduce your ego-sense to ashes, also your  
possessiveness ("ahamkara-mamakara")**. One who performs a sacrifice without  
being conscious of such high ideals but with the purpose of petty gains like  
ascending to paradise - is he not a fool?

**Kanchi mahAswAmi on the Vedas - _Veda and Vedanta: Are They Opposed to One  
Another?_** continued....   
There is no contradiction between the karmakanda and the jnanakanda. In the  
karmakanda itself jnana is given an elevated place and the limitations of  
karma mentioned. **There are hymns incorporating high philosophical truths in  
the Samhita part itself of the Vedas like, for instance, the "Nasadiyasukta",  
the "Purusasukta" and the "Tryambaka mantra". Also to be noted is the fact  
that the Upanisads themselves mention rites (karma) like the "Naciketagni".  
How would you explain this if the karmakanda and the jnanakanda were opposed  
to one another?** The underlying idea is that we must graduate from the one to  
the other, from karma to jnana.   
As we have already seen, the Gita (which is a Smrti) says that sacraments  
performed in a spirit of dedication to Isvara are a means of obtaining jnana.  
The same idea is found expressed in a Sruti text, the Isavasya Upanisad. **The  
first of the ten major Upanisads, it commences with the statement : "Live a  
hundred years performing Vedic rites. But do so in a spirit of dedication to  
Isvara. Then it will not keep you bound. " So it would be wrong to believe  
that the Upanisads teach inaction**.   
 **Karma, however, is not the goal of the Vedas. You must go beyond the stage  
of performing Vedic rituals even if they be for such a noble purpose as that  
of creating welfare in the world, cleansing your consciousness and  
propitiating the deities. Your must rise higher to the plane where you will  
realise that nothing other than the Paramatman exists**, that the phenomenal  
world is unreal, that there are no entities called deities (devatas) with an  
independent existence of their own and that there is no "I". **When you come  
to this state there will be no need for the Vedas too for you: this is stated  
in the Vedas themselves**.   
The Vedas are the laws laid down by Paramesvara. All people, all his subjects,  
must obey them. But **there is no need for the man who is always steeped  
inwardly as well as outwardly in the Reality that is the Paramatman to refer  
to this law with respect to all his actions. That is why it is said that for  
such men the Vedas cease to be Vedas**.

**_Kanchi mahAswAmi on the Vedas - Veda and Vedanta: Are They Opposed to One  
Another_**? continued....   
Though the Vedas are infinite, the seers have brought us only a few of them.  
But since, in this age of Kali, even these are difficult to master, they  
divided them into 1, 180 sakhas or recensions, each with Samhita, Brahmana,  
Aranyaka and Upanisad. Later, out of these many passed into oblivion. **Now  
the remaining too are threatened with extinction because people belonging to  
this generation have brought Vedic studies to such a sad state and earned  
merit thereby!**   
We have some Upanisads belonging to recensions of which neither the Samhitas  
nor the Brahmanas are studied. Even their texts are not available. The Samhita  
of the Sankhayana Sakha of the Rgveda is no longer chanted now; the fact is we  
have lost it. But the Kausitaki Upanisad which is a part of this recension is  
still extant. The Baskala Mantropanisad, also from the Rigveda, is still  
available: I am told a palm leaf manuscipt of the same is in the Adyar  
Library, Madras. But neither the Samhita nor the Brahmana of the Baskala Sakha  
is known to us. The Katha Upanisad belongs to the Katha Sakha of the Krsna-  
Yajurveda. **Did I not tell you that the Upanisad comes at the end of the  
Aranyaka? The Kathopanisad is very famous and is one of the major Upanisads;  
but its Aranyaka is not available**. **The Atharvaveda is totally forgotten in  
the South and is studied but in one or two parts of the country**. But still  
extant are Prasna, Mundaka and Mandukya which belong to this Veda and which  
form part of the Dasopanisad.   
All this points to the fact that, while parts of many Vedic recensions that  
pertain to karma or works have become extinct or have been forgotten, many of  
the Upanisads which are the means of jnana have been preserved. Great care has  
been taken to protect that part of our heritage which shows us the way to  
wisdom and light.   
The Upanisads are believed to have been large in number. **Two hundred years  
ago, an ascetic belonging to Kancipuram wrote a commentary on 108 Upanisads.  
He earned the name of "Upanisad Brahmendra". His monastic institution is still  
to be seen in Kanci**.

Maharishee Ramana gave lot of importance to morning and evening vedic  
chanting. As Sri Graham told, vedas means it is normally linked with karma  
kanda portion but it is inseparable and spread across covering jnana and kamya  
phala in very scattered manner.   
For eg, even in Sri Rudram, Chamakam the same song contains both jnana and  
material prayers.   
Vedic chants are powerful aid to self enquiry. I daily play vedas at morning 8  
AM in CD to create a Sri Ramasramam environment.   
During vedic chanting, Bhagavan's Photos carry lot amount of inexpressible  
bliss.   
One request to Ravi sir -- sometime ago you were asking in a thread whether I  
am reading all contents of your post before replying.   
My kind feedback is, please summarize the viewpoint in your own words as a  
preface and then include the exact book extracts of the great sages.   
Your words wil be simpler, quicker to read and useful for further discussions.   
But the moment you quote some great saint as an answer, I am not able to say  
anything against and the topic becomes deserted. And the doubts remain with  
me unclarified.   
So please summarize your viewpoint and then include the golden quotes sir.

That is the best way to develop a stasangha at home and be in sync with the  
activities at SriRamanashramam even though you may be hundreds of miles away  
from Thiruvanamalai. Either one can follow the Morning / Evening Veda  
Parayana or the Evening Tamil Parayana. I try to follow to my best the  
Monday, Sat Tamil Parayana at home at the same time as it is being chanted at  
Sri Ramana Ashramam.   
This is the current daily activity schedule. If someone can follow one of  
these schedules daily at 8 a.m, 5 p.m /6.30 p.m then it would be great. More  
ideal is if someone can follow all the 3 schedules at the same time in heir  
homes.   
 **Daily Schedule**   
6:45am: Milk Offering/breakfast   
 **8am: Vedaparayana**

The following are the Morning / Evening Vedic and Sanskrit Chants as followed  
in Ramana Ashram and I believe Bhagwan did give an outline for the same and  
others added some later. I once asked David Godman about this but he could  
not give me the proper answer to its background.   
If there is any changes in the list, I will make it.   
 **Ramana Ashram Morning Vedic and Sanskrit Chants at 8 a.m**   
1) Sri Ramna Chatvarimshat   
2) Sri Arunachla Pancharatnam   
3) Sri Taittriya Upanishad ( Sikisha /Anand /Bhrigu Valli )   
4) Sri Suktam   
5)Maha Narayana Upanishad ( some portions )   
Ramana Ashram Evening Vedic & Sanskrit Chants at 5 p.m**   
1)Dakshinamurti Stotram   
2) Sri Rudram   
3) Chamakam   
4) Purusha Suktam, Narayana Suktam,Durga Suktam   
5) Mantra Pushpam.   
 6)Upadesa Saram   
7) Nakarmana   
I have updated the list to make some changes after seeing the final version  
from the book  
"The Veda Parayana At Sri RamanaAshram - An English  
Translation . **   
 **According to this book :**   
1) In Sri Bhgawan's lifetime, Vedic Chanting/Veda Parayana was held twice a  
day morning and evening, lasting about 40 mts on each occasion, and this is  
still continued.   
2) This with the Puja which follows it is the only ritual which was or is  
generally attended at the Ashram.   
 **3) It was an hour of tremendous silence when he sat immobile as though  
carved in rock. He never allowed anything to interrupt it. **   
 **4) When asked whether people should learn the meaning, so as to follow it,   
he said no : It was sufficient that the chanting served as a support for  
meditation. **   
5) Despite this, it is also true, however, that the portions used for  
chanting were carefully chosen and approved by Sri Bhgawan Himself.   
 **6) Nothing has been deleted from them since Sri Bhagwan 's lifetime and  
only one item added. That is Sri Dakshinamurti Stotra which, mainly on the  
request of the late Major Chadwick ( Sadhu Arunachala ) is now used as the  
opening hymn before the evening chant. **   
7) Technically in the past even listening to the Chanting of Vedas is supposed  
to made available only to Brahmins, but this prohibition was abrogated by Sri  
Bhagwan.

Beautiful sir. My request is please copy your last two posts and make a  
separate thread.   
It is easy to refer and follow. You can add in some relevant thread.   
I envy Subramaniam sir and other full time devotees here.   
But proportionate to our desires only, samsara will be there. I have more  
desires and hence more work in material life I believe.

**KAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas - _Veda-bhasya[_ /b]continued....   
According to the Nirukta (one of the six Angas of the Vedas) a Brahmin comes  
under a curse by chanting the Vedas without knowing their meaning.   
A number of great men have written commentaries on the Vedas so as to inspire  
faith in the sacraments. Sri Madhvacarya has written a commentary for the  
first 40 suktas of the first kanda of the Rg Veda.   
Skandasvamin has also written a bhasya on the Rg Veda. To BhattaBhaskara we  
owe a commentary on the Krishna-Yajur Veda, and to Mahidhara on that of the  
Sukla-Yajur Veda. **In recent times, Dayananda Saraswati and Aravinda  
Ghose(Sri Aurobindo-Ravi) as well as his disciple Kapali Sastri have written  
expository treatises on the Vedas.** Though there are so many commentaries,  
the one by Sri Sayanacarya is particularly famous: many scholars, including  
Western Indologists, treat it as authoritative.   
There are five Vedas if you reckon the Yajur Veda to be two with its Sukla and  
Krsna divisions. Sayana has written commentaries on all the five.   
Expository treatises on the Vedas had been written before him but he was the  
first to write a bhasya for all the Vedas. Though Sayanacarya's commentary had  
been studied for centuries, a stage came recently when we feared that it would  
cease to hold any interest for students. Those who learned to chant the Vedas,  
without   
knowing their meaning, became priests while those who studied poetry and other  
subjects did not learn even to chant the mantras. So much so interest in the  
study of the Vedabhasya declined. **It was at this time that the  
Sastyabdapurti Trust was formed with a view to maintain the study of the Veda-  
bhasya**.   
When the Trust started to conduct examinations, **the Veda-bhasya meant no  
more than the printed text of the Vedic commentary kept in bookshops**. **The  
publishers were then worried that not many copies would be sold.** After the  
creation of the Trust we gave students not only scholarships but also copies  
of the Veda-bhasya. Our worry now was whether there would be enough copies in  
stock for fresh students. **It is with the grace of Parasakti, the Supreme  
Goddess that we have succeeded in reviving the study of the Veda-bhasya**. And  
so long as we have her grace there will be students ready to learn the subject  
and there will also be enough copies of the text.   
 **On the eve of a wedding, upanayana or simanta ceremony, we must consult a  
Vedic scholar who knows the Veda-bhasya to explain the meaning of the mantras  
employed in these rituals. On the day of the function itself the time at our  
disposal would be short. If we grasp the meaning and significance of the  
mantras beforehand we will have a more rewarding involvement in the  
function**.

**KAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas - _Veda-bhasya_** continued....   
If we know the meaning of the mantras chanted at a function, we stand to gain  
more benefits from it. We go through rites because we do not have the courage  
to give them up. Similarly, we must come to realise that it is wrong to  
perform a rite without knowing the meaning of the mantras chanted; we must  
therefore take the help of a pandita in this matter. As mentioned before,  
going through works with a knowledge of the significance and meaning of the  
mantras is more beneficial. We must have faith in the Upanishadic saying"  
Yadeva vidyaya karoti tadeva viryavattaram bhavati".   
At an upanayana, it is the brahmacarin (as the karta) who chants the mantras;  
similarly it is the groom alone who intones them at a marriage. What do you  
expect of all invitees to do at such functions? Do they come only for the  
luncheon or dinner, or to keep chatting, to see the dance recital or to  
listens to the nagasvaram music? Is their part only to make themselves happy  
in this manner? No. The Vedic mantras deserve our highest respect. When they  
are being intoned we must honour them by   
listening to them intently. The mantras create well- being for all. **If the  
invitees and others at a function listen to them and are able to follow their  
meaning they will earn merit even though they do not have the role of the  
karta in it**.   
Take the case of the asvamedha (horse sacrifice). Only a king who has subdued  
all other rulers, that is a maharaja or a sarvabhauma, is qualified to perform  
it. So only a monarch during a particular period in history, a monarch whose  
sway extends all over the world, is entitled to conduct this sacrifice. The  
asvamedha brings more benefits than any other rite.Now the question arises: In  
any generation only one individual is perhaps capable of earning so much merit  
(by performing the horse sacrifice). Why are the Vedas so partial that they  
have made it impossible for the vast majority of people (who cannot perform  
the sacrifice themselves) to earn such merit? Is it true that only a ruler,  
who has immense strength and enormous resources at his command, is capable of  
benefiting from such a sacrifice? If people of good conduct and character are  
denied the same merit as a powerful emperor can earn, does it not amount to  
deceiving them? How can the Vedas be so partial to one man?   
In truth no partiality can be ascribed to the Vedas. A Vedic rite is  
admittedly beneficial to the man who performs it. But, at the same time, it  
does good to all the world. If I light a lamp in the darkness here does it not  
bring light to all the people present and not to me alone? It may be that the  
performer of a Vedic work receives more special   
benefits than others. But the sastras shows the way by which these others may  
also reap the same fruits as the karta- in fact the Vedas themselves mention  
it. If ordinary people cannot conduct a horse sacrifice they may get to know  
how it is performed. They may pay attention to the hymns chanted during the  
sacrifice and also try to follow   
their meaning. In this way they derive the full benefits of the sacrifice  
performed by an imperial ruler. This fact is referred to in the section  
dealing with horse sacrifices in the Vedas.   
 **In the same way, whether it is a marriage or a funeral, the merit will be  
earned in full if we closely follow the rite and listen to the mantras with  
due knowledge of their meaning.**

**KAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas -Sadanga: The Six Limbs of the Vedas**   
 **The six Angas are Siksa (Phonetics); Vyakarana (grammar); Nirukta (lexicon,  
etymology); Kalpa (manual of rituals); Chandas (prosody); Jyotisa (astronomy-  
astrology). A Brahmin must be acquainted with all. That he must be well-  
versed in the Vedas goes without saying. He must first learn to chant them and  
proficiency in the six Angas will later help him to gain insights into their  
meaning**.   
Siksa is the nose of the vedapurusa, Vyakarana his mouth, Kalpa his hand,  
Nirukta his ear, Chandas his foot and Jyotisa his eye. The reason for each  
sastra being identified with a part of the body will become clear as we deal  
with the Angas individually.   
 **Siksa comes first among the six limbs of the Vedas, the nose of the  
Vedapurusa. The function of the nose here is not to be taken only as that of  
perceiving smells. It has also the function of breathing; in fact it is one of  
the organs of breathing. Siksa serves as the life-breath of the Vedic  
mantras**.   
Where is the life of a Vedic mantra centred? Each syllable of a hymn is to be  
enunciated strictly according to its measure. Clarity of pronunciation is what  
is intended. Apart from this, each syllable is raised, lowered or pronounced  
evenly -- **udatta, anudatta, savarita**. If attention is paid to these  
points, there will be tonal purity. A mantra yields the desired fruit if each  
syllable is vocalised with clarity and tonal accuracy. The phonetic and tonal  
exactitude of a mantra is even more important that its meaning. **In other  
words, even though the meaning is not understood, if the tonal form takes  
shape correctly, the mantra will bring the intended benefit. So the life-  
breath of the Vedas, which are a collection of mantras, is their sound**.   
There is a mantra to cure scorpion sting. Its meaning is not revealed. Its  
potency is in its sound. Certain sounds have certain powers associated with  
them. It is sometimes asked: Why should the sraddha mantras be in Sanskrit?  
May they not be in English or Tamil? Those who raise these questions do not  
realise that it is the sound that matters here, not the language as such. If  
the teeth of a sorcerer were knocked off, his witchcraft [magic] would have no  
effect. Why? Because the man would   
not be able to recite this spell properly.   
Enunciation of the mantras is most important to the Vedas. What do we do about  
it? **Siksa is the science that deals with the character of Vedic syllables it  
determines their true nature. The science of the sounds of human speech is  
called phonetics and it is more important to the Vedic language than to any  
other tongue. The reason is that even if there is a slight change in how you  
vocalise a syllable the efficacy of the mantra will be affected.**   
 **It is because of the importance of Vedic phonetics that Siksa has been  
placed first among the six Angas. It is dealt with in the Taittiriya  
Upanishad. Its "Siksavalli" begins like this: "Let us now explain the Siksa  
sastra "**. The name of the sastra occurs here as well as in many other Vedic  
texts with a long "e" ("Siksa"). Sankara observes in his commentary: "Dairghyam Chandasam": it means that the usually short "i" occurs as long [in  
the Vedas]. (Such examples are to be found in Tamil poetry also. ) **I told  
you that the Vedic language is not called Sanskrit but Chandas. "Chandasam",  
from "chandas", denotes here a Vedic usage.**

**KAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas -Sadanga: _The Six Limbs of the Vedas_**  
continued...   
We may gauge the importance of articulate speech from the fact that the Lord  
has bestowed this faculty only on man. Such a wonderful gift of Isvara must  
not be squandered or abused in idle gossip or useless talk. We must use it to  
grasp the divine powers and endeavour to create the well-being of mankind  
thereby. And we must also try to raise our own self with it. All these lofty  
purposes can be served with the Vedic mantras that the sages have gathered  
from space for our benefit.   
 **If you recognise this fact you will realise why there should be a sastra  
called Siksa specially for the purpose of guiding us in the enunciation of  
Vedic mantras. This science as developed by our forefathers arouses the wonder  
of linguistic scientists even today. It teaches us how the syllables are to be  
produced accurately and describes in the minutest detail how the passage of  
the breath coming from the pit of the stomach is to be controlled. Further, it  
tells us on which parts of the body the breath must   
impinge and how it must be discharged from the mouth**.   
 **In a sense, air going into our body in different ways is a manifestation of  
the yogic science: it is because of the vibrations caused in our nadis as a  
result of the passage of our breath that our emotions and powers take shape.  
There is a saying, "What is in the macrocosm is present in the microcosm. " As  
mentioned before, the vibrations within us produce vibrations outside also and  
these are the cause of worldly activities. That is why those who have mastered  
the mantras have the same powers as   
those who have achieved yogic perfection controlling their breath. The one is  
mantrayoga, the other is Rajayoga**.   
Siksa deals with "uccarna", "svara", "matra", "bala", "sama" and "santana".  
The sound of each mantra is determined with the utmost accuracy. How different  
sounds have their source in different parts of the body and how they are  
vocalised, all such details which are of scientific and practical importance  
are dealt with in this Anga. If it says, "Join your lips in this way and such  
and such a sound will be produced as you speak", you may verify it for  
yourself in practice and find it to be true.   
The Vedic syllables must be pronounced with clarity. The character of their  
sound should not be distorted a bit. But no force must be used in vocalising  
the syllables. There should be no damage done - no erosion of the sound - and  
no violence should be suggested in the pronunciation.   
How does a tigress carry its cubs? Tigresses and cats carry their young ones  
by holding them firmly with their teeth, yet in doing so they do not cause any  
hurt to the little ones. The Vedic hymns must be chanted in the same way, the  
syllables enunciated gently and yet distinctly. Panini, has written the most  
important work on grammar, a subject which comes next (after Siksa) among the  
Vedangas.   
Apart from him many others written on Siksa. There are thirty works in this  
category. Panini's and Yajnavalkya's are particularly important. Each Veda has  
attached to it a "Pratisakhya" which examines Vedic sounds. There are also  
ancient commentaries on them and these too are included in Siksa.

**KAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas -Sadanga: _The Six Limbs of the Vedas_**  
continued...   
 **Vyakarana or grammar is the "mukha" of the Vedapurusa, his mouth**.There  
are a number of works on Sanskrit grammar. The most widely used and important  
is the one by the great sage Panini. There is a gloss - a vartika- on his  
"Vyakarna-sutra" by Vararuci. Patanjali has written a bhasya or commentary on  
Panini's sutras. These three are the chief works on Sanskrit grammar.   
There is a difference between grammar and other sastras. In the case of other  
subjects the original sutras constituting them are esteemed more than their  
bhasyas. But, **in the case of grammar, or Vyakarana, the Vartika is more  
valued than the sutras and still more valued is the bhasya**.   
According to one reckoning, there are six sastras. Vyakarana is one of them.  
Four of the sastras are particularly important: apart from Vyakarana, Tarka  
(logic), Mimamsa and Vedanta. Vyakarna is also one of the vedic sadanga (six  
limbs of the vedas). "Sucant sutram ", so it is said. (The sutra is just an  
indication of something, a truth or a principle.) Every sastra has a bhasya  
and each such bhasya is known by a particular name. **The vyakarana bhasya (of  
Patanjali) alone is called "Mahabhasya", "the great commentary "**.   
Siksa, Vyakarna and the subjects I have yet to deal with -Chandas and Nirukta-  
are Vedangas-(limbs of the vedas) connected with language. After I said that I  
would deal with matters basic to our religion, I have been speaking about  
linguistic studies and grammar. Next I am going to deal with prosody. By works  
on religion we ordinarily mean those [directly] relating to God, worship,  
devotion, jnana, dharma and so on. Would not the right thing for me then be to  
speak about such works? When we dealt with the vedas a number of matters  
cropped up, matters regarded as germane to religion. Religion will find a  
prominent place in the subjects that I have yet to speak about, Kalpa,  
Mimamsa, the Puranas and Dharmasastra., But in between has arisen the science  
of language that has apparently no connection with religion.   
 **In the Vedic view everything is connected with the Lord. There is no  
question of dividing subjects into "religious" and "non-religious". Even the  
science of medicine, Ayurveda, which pertains to physical well being, is  
ultimately meant for Atmic uplift- or for that matter, military science  
(Dhanurveda). That is why they were made part of traditional lore. So too  
political economy which is also an Atma-sastra. Why are works belonging to  
these fields held in great esteem? All subjects, all works, that teach a man  
to bring order, refinement and purity in every aspect of his life and help him  
thus to take the path to liberation are regarded as religious in character**.   
Sound is the highest of the perceived forms of the Paramatman and language is  
obviously connected with it. It is the concern of Siksa and Vyakarana to  
refine and clarify it and make it a means for the well-being of our Self.   
 **Grammar is associated with Sabdabrahman. Worship of the Nadabrahman which  
is the goal of music is a branch of this. If sounds are well discerned and  
employed in speech they will serve not only the purpose of communication but  
also of cleansing us inwardly. The science of language is helpful here**.

Dear Ravi sir   
As I requested, kindly summarize your views on Vedas that will serve as a  
lucid summary of your viewpoints. Nowadays (long time) I am only seeing your  
exact extracts from books on any topic. Earlier you used to summarize your  
view points that definitely serve as a crisp easy to refer valuable  
perception.   
Also i am still waiting rely for my PM, please reply in private message.

ksksat(Krishna),   
I responded to your personal mail twice,looks like you are not accessing your  
yahoo id.Please let me know if you have any other mail id that i can respond  
to.I will again mail it.   
Coming to your request-that I must summarize my thoughts on Vedas,I am not  
sure what you need.One fundamental thing that I would point out with regard to  
the Vedas is the Nature of sound and the very language of the Vedas.In the  
Vedas,the sound comes first and then the meaning follows.In everyday  
language,the Meaning comes first and then the choice of the word to express  
it.We learn A for apple,B for Biscuit,C for Custard,etc.We are just taught  
that Apple is apple,Biscuit is Biscuit and Custard is custard and learn to use  
these words.We never question why Apple should be called Apple or Biscuit  
should be called Biscuit,etc.There is no connection between the sound 'Apple'  
and the Object that it brings to our mind, i.e the Apple Fruit.It is simply  
called so through conventional usage and we accept it and employ it.We then  
form sentences to express ourselves,our thoughts.   
Unlike this,the Vedic Language is deeply symbolic,in that the very sound  
naturally brought forth the image signified to the mind.Not just this,the very  
same word was used to signify different objects which shared that quality  
signified.This brought in the possibility wherein the same sentence may come  
to have a deep significance for someone initiated into its mysteries and at  
the same time carry something totally pedestrian and common place for the vast  
majority of laymen.   
Anyone who tries to translate the Vedas will run the risk of interpreting it  
in the ordinary sense-and brand it as part of Karma Kanda.Unless one has the  
key to Vedic symbolism,the true inner sense will forever elude him.He will  
then brand that this part of Vedas only serve to prepare for what eventually  
the Upanishads are going to proclaim as eternal verities.He will then mistake  
that the upanishads are the part of Vedas that Deal with Eternal truths and  
that the rest of the Vedas are some sort of a hotch potch,and at best a  
preparatory prelude to the upanishads and can be dispensed with safely.   
How to understand the symbolic sense of the Vedas?How to draw on the founts of  
inspiration inherent in the Vedas?How many are at all aware that such a deep  
and complete body of knowledge has survived over the ages?What is the nature  
of this Robustness?   
Most Indians are totally ignorant of this Most Ancient Science and  
discipline.Atleast a rudimentray acquaintance with these aspects of the Vedas  
will help us suspect deeper treasures hidden herein and encourage us to foster  
what little remains in practice.   
The talks of mahaswami on the Vedas cover all these aspects.Later,we will also  
see what Sri Aurobindo has to say on many of these aspects.It is in this  
spirit that this thread was launched.   
Namaskar

Dear Sri Ravi   
What you said is very true. Few years back there was a program on TV in which  
many people assembled there claimed how they were fooled by various Godmen  
/astrologers /sooth sayers etc. One Swami from some Hindu spiritual  
institution who had come as the Chief Guest of that program asked the audience  
how many of you have studied the Bhagavad Gita Completely ( any one version /  
any author ) and no one raised the hands. Next he asked how many of you at  
least attempted to study the same thoroughly ( not just browsing it through  
here and there ) and again no one raised the hands. Then he asked how many of  
you have at least the Bhagavad Gita book ( any version ) in your house then  
few hands rose up. He smiled and told that he is not surprised that these  
people got fooled by Godmen, astrologers, soothsayers etc etc. He told it  
is the duty of every Hindu to at least make an attempt to study one version of  
the Bhagavad Gita thoroughly so that they have answers to most of the problems  
they face in their day to day life and do not run to astrologers /Godmen /  
sooth sayers to find answers to the same.   
I would modify the above reply to say that every Hindu must first thoroughly  
study the **7 Volumes of the Voice of God ( Deivathin Kural ) of Kanchi  
Mahaswamigal** and **at least 1 version of the Bhagavad Gita thoroughly** so  
that most of the answers that they are seeking are already available there  
without the need to run to astrologers. Godmen /sooth sayers etc. Today with  
the advancement in technology both the above resources are available for free  
on the net and people can download the same and read it on their desktops /  
laptops/tablets /Iphones etc.   
Sringeri Acharya Sri Chandrasekhara Bharati said that for acquiring worldly  
riches we are willing to cross the seas and willing to endure various  
hardships in foreign lands but for spiritual wealth we want it to be delivered  
to our homes on a plate and enjoy the same with least effort. Spiritual  
laziness is responsible for the mushrooming of many pseudo spiritual  
organizations and half baked spiritual teachers in India and abroad who  
exploit / misguide the people and after getting fooled by them people end up  
crying later as it happened in that TV Program where many wept as to how they  
were exploited by various teachers /Godmen /astrologers etc.

## Re:[74] The Vedas

**KAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas -Sadanga: _The Six Limbs of the Vedas_  
continued...   
The Rgveda and the Samaveda are entirely poetical in form. The Yajurveda  
consists of both prose and poetry. **It is because poetry forms their major  
part that the Vedas are called Chandas**.The tailor takes your measurement to  
make your suit. He will not otherwise be able to cut the cloth properly.  
Similarly, poetry gives form to   
our thoughts and feelings. Your shirt has to be so many inches wide, so many  
inches long, isn't so? Similarly, poetry also has its measurement expressed in  
"feet" and number of syllables. **The Sastra that deals with such measurement  
is "Chandas" and the text on which it is chiefly based is Chanda sutra by  
Pingala**. People who have received initiation into a mantra touch their head  
with their hand, mentioning the name of the sage associated with the mantra,  
touch their nose mentioning the   
chandas and touch their heart mentioning the deity invoked.   
A Vedic mantra or the stanza of an ordinary poem is divided into four parts.  
In most metres there are four feet and each foot is divided into the same  
number of syllables or mantras.In most poems the padas are equal. Let me  
illustrate with a sloka with which, I suppose, all of you are familiar,The  
four feet of this stanza: Suklambaradharam Visnum   
Sasivarnam caturbhujam   
Prasannavadanam dhyayet   
Sarvavighnopasantaye   
Each pada in this has eight syllables.Only vowels and consonants in  
conjunction with vowels are to be counted as syllables; other consonants are  
not to be counted. Then alone will you get the figure of eight. The eight  
syllables in the first pada are :1.su; 2. klam; 3. ba; 4. ra; 5. dha; 6. ram;  
7. vi; 8. snum. The other padas will   
have similarly eight syllables each. **The stanza with four feet, each foot of  
eight syllables, is "Anustubh", which metre is used in the Vedas and in  
poetical works of a later period**.   
As mentioned earlier, the foot of a stanza with eight syllables Anustubh. With  
nine syllables it is "Brhati" and with ten "Pankti". "Tristubh" has eleven  
syllables and "Jagati" twelve. We have a 26 syllable metre  
("Bhujangavijrambhita") which belongs to the category of "Utkrti". Beyond this  
is "Dandaka" of which there are several types. The metre in which  
Apparasvamigal's Tiru-t-tandagam is composed is related to this metre.   
 **" Gayatri", "Usnik", "Anustubh", "Pankti", "Tristubh" and "Jagati" are  
Vedic metres**.
