A devotee raised a question about the Heart. Did Bhagavan feel the Heart as  
the point of Realization in   
His first or early experience? Bhagavan replied, 'I began to use the word  
after seeing the literature on   
the subject. I correlated it with my experience.' (Talk No. 134). Another  
devotee asked, 'How do you say   
that the Heart is on the right, whereas the biologists have found it to be on  
the left?' Sri Ramana replied,   
'Quite so. The physical organ is on the left; that is not denied. But the  
Heart which I speak is non-physical   
and is only on the right side. It is my experience, no authority is required  
by me. Still you can find confirmation in a Malayalam Ayurvedic book and in  
Sita Upanishad.'(Talk 4).   
Bhagavan said: 'I had been saying all along that the Heart center was on the  
right, notwithstanding the refutation by some learned men that physiology  
taught them otherwise. I speak from experience. I knew   
it even in my home during my trances.' (Talk $ 408). This was further  
confirmed by Bhagavan after a subsequent death experience on the Hill. He  
related, 'I had a very clear vision and experience. All of a   
sudden a light came from one side erasing the vision of the world was  
completely cut out. I felt the muscular   
organ on the left had stopped work, I could understand that the body was like  
a corpse, that the circulation   
of blood had stopped and the body became blue and motionless. Vasudeva Sastri  
embraced the body, wept   
over my death, but I could not speak. All the time I was feeling that the  
Heart center on the right was   
working well as ever. This state continued 15 to 20 minutes. Then suddenly  
something shot out from the right to the left resembling a rocket bursting in  
air. The blood circulation was resumed and normal condition   
restored. (Talks # 408)
