In the next month I will be upgrading the forum to the latest version of the  
software.   
Hopefully it will be smooth and free from problems, but it might require the  
forum to be disabled for half a day.   
I will post here on the day before the upgrade is to take place.

Dear Sri Graham,   
Namaste,   
i was just wondering, if you can provide a small space in the top of this  
webpage, a section for Daily Quotes of Sri Bhagavan, automated may be. That  
would be really nice to read it everyday. Something like we have the Ashramam  
website - Quote of the Day.   
Just a suggestion. i request our members also to share some thoughts on this.   
Thank you,   
Regards,   
Nagaraj

Dear Anil,   
**   
If you come to Chennai, you have to again catch a train to Tindivanam and  
alight and then catch another train to Tiruvannamalai. From T'malai Railway  
Station, you have to take   
an autorickshaw and come to the Asramam.   
It is better to catch a bus which takes you directly to Tiruvannamalai from  
Chennai. But from Chennai Central Railway Station, you have to come to  
Koyambedu Bus Stand, which is about 12 kms. You can cover by auto. Speak  
English. Not many understand Hindi in Tamizh Nadu.   
If you can afford, you can come directly by taxi up to the Asramam, for which  
charges would be Rs 2000+ one way.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Anil,   
Yes. Katpadi is definitely closer to Tiruvannamalai than Chennai   
or Bangalore. You can alight at Katpadi and catch a bus and come   
to Tiruvannamalai. It may take about 3+ hours. Taxis may also   
be plying from Katpadi to Tiruvannamalai.   
Arunachala Siva.
