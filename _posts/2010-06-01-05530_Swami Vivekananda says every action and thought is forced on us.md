**THE GOAL (Delivered in San Francisco, March 27, 1900)**   
 **You and I are not free. I am thirsty. There is something called thirst,  
over which I have no control, [which] forces me to drink water. Every action  
of my body and even every thought of my mind is forced out of me. I have got  
to do it. That is why I am bound. . . . I am forced to do this, to have this,  
and so on. . . . And what is meant by why and wherefore? [Being subject to  
external forces.] Why do you drink water? Because thirst forces you. You are a  
slave. You never do anything of your own will because you are forced to do  
everything. Your only motive for action is some force.. . .   
The earth, by itself, would never move unless something forced it. Why does  
the light burn? It does not burn unless somebody comes and strikes a match.  
Throughout nature, everything is bound. Slavery, slavery! To be in harmony  
with nature is [slavery]. What is there in being the slave of nature and  
living in a golden cage?** The greatest law and order is in the [knowledge  
that man is essentially free and divine] Now we see that the question why and  
wherefore can only be asked [in ignorance]. I can only be forced to do  
something through something else.   
[You say] God is free. Again you ask the question why God creates the world.  
You contradict yourself. The meaning of God is entirely free will. The  
question put in logical language is this: What forced Him, who can never be  
forced by anybody, to create the world? You say in the same question, What  
forced Him? The question is nonsense. He is infinite by His very nature; He is  
free. We shall answer questions when you can ask them in logical language.  
Reason will tell you that there is only one Reality, nothing else. Wherever  
dualism has risen, monism came to a head and drove it out.   
Many want pleasure [as] the goal. For that pleasure they seek only the senses.  
On the higher planes much pleasure is to be sought. Then on spiritual planes.  
Then in himself  God within him. **The man whose pleasure is outside of  
[himself] becomes unhappy when that outside thing goes. You cannot depend for  
this pleasure upon anything in this universe.** If all my pleasures are in  
myself, I must have pleasure there all the time because I can never lose my  
Self.. . . **Mother, father, child, wife, body, wealth  everything I can  
lose except my self. . . ** bliss in the Self All desire is contained in the  
Self.. . . This is individuality which never changes, and this is perfect.   
 **Whatever we [think] that we become. If you think you are poor sinners you  
hypnotise yourselves: "I am a miserable, crawling worm." Those who believe in  
hell are in hell when they die; those who say that they will go to heaven [go  
to heaven].**   
 **There is not much value in books, and in [secondhand] religion there is no  
value whatsoever. It is like eating. Your religion would not satisfy me Jesus  
saw God and Buddha saw God. If you have not seen God, you are no better than  
the atheist. Only he is quiet, and you talk much and disturb the world with  
your talk. Books and bibles and scriptures are of no use. I met an old man  
when I was a boy; [he did not study any scripture, but he transmitted the  
truth of God by a touch].**   
Silence ye teachers of the world. Silence ye books. Lord, Thou alone speak and  
Thy servant listeneth.. . . If truth is not there, what is the use of this  
life? We all think we will catch it, but we do not. Most of us catch only  
dust. God is not there. **If no God, what is the use of life?** Is there any  
resting-place in the universe? [It is up to us to find it]; only we do not  
[search for it intensely. We are] like a little piece of maw carried on in the  
current.

Dear prasanth,   
Certain basic biological needs have to be quenched. Excepting   
sex, the thirst, hunger, sleep, evacuation - these were also done   
by Jnanis. What Bhagavan Ramana has said: You do not seek   
other pleasures, which shall cause bondage to you. Try to quell   
them through your efforts and perseverance.   
Arunachala Siva.
