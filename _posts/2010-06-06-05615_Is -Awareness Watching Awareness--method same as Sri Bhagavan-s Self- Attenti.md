There is already a topic about the author Michael Langford, who coined this  
term 'awareness watching awareness', but I would like to hear your opinion on  
his interpretation of Self-Attention.   
Michael Langford describes the way he came to this conclusion like this.   
 "... (I wondered) If I AM is this present awareness, just the awareness  
that is now looking at this room, then paying attention to the I AM is just: **My awareness watching my awareness**.   
Atleast in my opinion this sounds true and is logical. And this is how he  
describes the practice itself: "Turn your attention away from thought and  
watch the watcher, see the seer."   
When he first found this out, he asked Sri V. Ganesan (grand nephew of Sri  
Ramana) about this practice and he approved it saying that he calls it  
'attention attending to attention'. Michael Langford also backs this  
interpretation by giving quotes from "The garland of Guru's sayings", by Sri  
Muruganar: The only true and full awareness **is awareness of awareness.   
Till awareness is awareness of itself**, it knows no peace at all.   
Is it not because you are yourself Awareness, that you now perceive This  
universe?   
 **If you observe awareness steadily, this awareness itself as Guru will  
reveal the Truth**.   
" **If with mind turned towards Awareness and concentrating on Awareness, one  
seeks the Self**, the world made up of ether and other elements is real, as  
all things are Awareness, the one sole substance of true Being."   
" **If instead of looking outward at objects, you observe that looking**, all  
things now shine as I, the seer. Perception of objects is mere illusion."   
" **The ego image moves reflected in the mind 's waves. How to stop this  
movement, how to regain the state of stillness? Don't observe these movements,  
seek the Self, instead**. It is wisdom to gain and abide in silence."   
Also Michael James says that Michael Langford's intepretation is correct.

Quote  
Is 'Awareness Watching Awareness'-method same as Sri Bhagavan's Self-  
Attention?  
Yes, that is what Sri Bhagavan clearly says.   
"What is essential in any sadhana [practice] is to try to bring back the  
running mind and fix it on one thing only. **Why then should it not be brought  
back and fixed in Self-attention? That alone is Self-enquiry (atma-vicara).  
That is all that is to be done! "**   
Now what is the Self that we are to fix our attention to? Bhagavan answers: "You ( the Self ) are Awareness. Awareness is another name for you." So this  
practice could as well be called 'Awareness-Attention'.   
In Nan Yar Bhagavan also calls this practice by the name 'ahamukham' which  
means I-facing (and therefore could also be called 'Awareness-facing').   
I don't know if anyone cares, but one of my favourite teachers Shinzen Young  
says that he practiced mindfulness of breathing in the beginning of his path.  
And after some months of practice he asked for more advanced method from his  
(zen) teacher. His teacher replied: "A more advanced method? Some people have  
practiced mindfulness of breathing for twenty years and are still learning new  
things every day. But you asked for a more advanced method, so here you have  
it: "Find out who you really are".   
Shinzen then asked 'how?', to which his teacher replied: "Just do it." And  
when Shinzen asked for some tip, his teacher said: "Turn the light (of  
consciousness) on itself."

That which can be objectified can be watched - awareness watches the object.   
How can Awareness/Self be watched? Who is watching? It just IS.   
These explanations are at the root of all errors. ... 'are there two, one to  
watch the other'.   
Self-enquiry is NOT this method. Self-enquiry is holding onto and remaining as  
Self/Awareness of Being. A subtle but profound difference.   
Whatever can be objectified is not Self, it is just another thought, another  
figment of the imagination.

Indeed, but you can always try to turn attention away from experienced to the  
experiencer and look if there is any **thing** there

Self enquiry is simply the attention to the Self. For ever, permanently.  
Awareness is the state of Being. I do not understand   
how Awareness can be watched, objectified. Michael Longford is   
not correct in his saying.

Sri Ramana clearly has even talked about stages in Self Enquiry: "First the Self Sees itself as Object, then the Self sees itself as Void, and  
finally, the Self sees itself as Self, only in the last, there is no seeing,  
as seeing is being"   
Its all stages, each person moves ahead in his/her own way.   
When Faith is sincere, there is only one way ahead, going upwards the mountain  
peak, any direction upwards takes you to only the peak of the mountain and no  
other destination. It may only appear that each person is taking a different  
route to different destination, but a person with complete faith in his Guru  
can only Go Upwards to the Source - peak - Self.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear snow,   
"Being aware" is not "watching awareness". How can it be?   
I am aware I am tall or short. Am I watching my shortness   
or tall height, every moment?   
I am aware I am having high fever. Am I watching my feverishness?   
I can at best watch into the thermometer after placing it under my   
tongue once in two hours. Otherwise I am not watching my   
feverishness. My wife may watch it, by placing her hand on my   
forehead. That is all. Watching needs a thermometer or a second person.   
Arunachala Siva.

It something like, even Bhagavan has said in some context (just a vague  
reflection), do we ever need to see that we are man/woman, etc...   
does anyone ever have to watch himself to affirm that he/she is man or woman,   
we know intrinsically that we are man/woman, we do not need to watch ourselves  
to know that I am man,   
I know I am man... I know I am a woman. similarly, can awareness ever watch  
itself? it is impossible   
to watch something implies subject and object. awareness being itself the  
subject and object, there is a great difference here, awareness cannot watch  
itself for it itself is awareness. if at all there is any watching, then be  
assured that those are your own making, ideas, notions, imaginations, etc...  
about awareness.   
awareness still needs to take birth.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

A quote by Michael Langford (the creator of this method).   
"Examples of plastic flowers that are no longer a direct means to Truth are: Buddhism (Tibetan, Theravada and Zen), Christianity, Christian Mysticism,  
Islam, Sufism, Judaism, Jewish Mysticism, Hinduism, The Gurdjieff lineage,  
Krishnamurti, Scientology, the Poonjaji (Lucknow lineage), the Ramesh Balsekar  
lineage.   
These are all plastic flowers pretending to be living flowers. These are all  
indirect paths with an almost endless number of delays in them. They are all  
distortions of the original intentions. Because the Lucknow lineage is modern,  
it provides an excellent opportunity to see how a Sages teaching is distorted.  
The Sage being Sri Ramana Maharshi and the ones distorting the teaching being  
the Lucknow lineage. The same is true for the Ramesh Balsekar lineage. The  
Sage being Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj and the ones doing the distorting being  
the Ramesh Balsekar lineage."

I find there to be some contradictions between Sri Bhagavan's and Michael  
Langford's teachings. Michael Langford says that awareness watching awareness  
should be always done eyes shut, but Sri Bhagavan said that it is totally  
immaterial in Self-Enquiry and actually sometimes advised vichara to be done  
eyes open.   
Also, here is a dialogue with Sri Bhagavan and a questioner: D.: I do not understand what I should do.   
M: **If it is anything objective the way can be shown objectively. This   
is subjective.**   
D.: But I do not understand.   
M.: What! Do you not understand that you are?   
D.: Please tell me the way.   
M.: **Is it necessary to show the way in the interior of your own home?   
This is within you.**   
And here is another one   
D: "How to make the Quest, Who am I?   
M: " **The way is subjective, not objective; so it cannot and need not be  
shown by another**. Is it necessary to show anyone the way inside his own  
house? If the seeker keeps his mind still, that will be enough."   
Michael Langford however, gives atleast ten descriptions of his practice.

Dear snow,   
I agree with you. The problem with commentators is that they   
vitiate the essence of original message of the Master. For example,   
take Sri Sankara. He said Advaitam, the One without a second.   
But his followers were trying to out-do Sri Sankara. Subsequently,   
as one may see in Panchadasi and other works, there are two schools under Sri  
Sankara, the Bamati School and the Bhatta School. One says that one will have  
still the sports of Maya veiling him, till he attains videha kaivalyam, that  
is leaving the body in liberated state. The other school says Maya stops the  
sports, once you kill the ego, which is only Maya-swarupam. Both have a set  
of arguments to support their views. The whole essence of Advaitam is lost in  
this lingual diarrohea of commentators. If one attains   
advaitic siddhi, one should stop commenting. If you start addressing someone  
as different from you, you accept duality.   
Arunachala Siva.

Ongoing through the comments on Awareness Watching Awareness of Micheal  
Langford,doubts are expressed by members of this forum that awareness  
watching awareness cannot be the state of BEING.If the members go through  
the complete text of Mr.Langford, it will be clear that it is same as self  
enquiry.Mr. Micheal very clearly explains that Awareness watching awareness is  
nothing but turning our attention inwards.He has categorically mentioned that  
Awareness Watching awareness is Awareness Being Awareness   
He has clarified that because of long ancient habit of looking outwards  
towards people places and things,the word watching is used in practice  
instructions and that way we take the same habit of watching the people places  
and things and we shut our eyes and turn inwards.That is why the word watching  
is used.   
My question to devotees is that whether any of the member is able to turn his  
attention inwards without effort.As for i am concerned, I am not able to turn  
my attention inwards with out effort and the moment effort is lost,  
immediately mind turns outwards.The effort is put by Ego and not by Self and  
when ego comes in, then the thinker comes into play and so the duality.When a  
question was put to bhagavan on Choiceless Awareness(effortless awareness)  
advocated by JK(which is same as state of being), Bhagavan replied that it is  
same as Summa Iru and if one can attain that state then it is fine.However  
Bhagavan says that due to age old vasanas, a person cannot attain Choiceless  
awareness without effort and hence continuous effort is   
required.Tamil being an ancient language any ideas can be expressed very  
clearly without any distortion in Tamil.Bhagavan has composed most of his  
works in Tamil.Once it is translated in other language especially english, due  
to want of proper words, the meaning gets distorted even though the author  
may like to give exact meaning.Watching also falls in that category.

Also, 'AWA-method' seems to be a practice that is done on certain hours, but  
Bhagavan said that vichara should be done throughout the entire waking state.

Dear Mr.Snow,   
With reference to your post as above, i reproduce below in italics from  
Mr.Langford's article from the web site <http://www.dosisnet.de/awa.pd>as wrt  
to duration of practice. _To change this long habit of looking outward you  
need to practice. Spend as many hours per day practicing as you can. If you  
only practice awareness watching awareness for 30 minutes per day and spend  
the other 23 and a half hours looking outward, you will not progress very  
quickly_   
From the above it is evident that Mr.Langford is inline with Bhagaan wrt  
duration of practice.

Also, 'AWA-method' seems to be a practice that is done on certain hours, but  
Bhagavan said that vichara should be done throughout the entire waking state.   
Dear Mr.Snow,   
With reference to your post as above, i reproduce below in italics from  
Mr.Langford's article from the web site <http://www.dosisnet.de/awa.pd>as wrt  
to duration of practice. _To change this long habit of looking outward you  
need to practice. Spend as many hours per day practicing as you can. If you  
only practice awareness watching awareness for 30 minutes per day and spend  
the other 23 and a half hours looking outward, you will not progress very  
quickly_   
From the above it is evident that Mr.Langford is inline with Bhagaan wrt  
duration of practice.   
Yes, i have read that. But as Michael Langford says, "the Awareness Watching  
Awareness Method is always to be done with the eyes closed."   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or  
not like this: A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes   
it happens that when the eyes are closed the latent thoughts rush forth with  
great vigour. It may also be difficult to   
introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of mind to do so.  
The mind is contaminated when it takes in   
objects. Otherwise, it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind  
active in its own pursuit without taking in   
external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
And here is another quote: Question: Is it enough if I spend some time in the mornings and some time in  
the evenings for this atma-vichara? Or should I do it always, even when I am  
writing or walking?   
A: What is your real nature? Is it writing, walking or being? The one  
unalterable reality is being. Until you realize that state of pure being you  
should pursue the enquiry. If once you are established in it there will be no  
further worry.No one will enquire into the source of thoughts unless thoughts  
arise. So long as you think I am walking or I am writing, enquire who does  
it.

## Re:[24]TAT TVAM ASI  Is 'Awareness Watching Awareness'-method same as Sri Bhagavan's Self- Attention?

Friends,   
 If we do not get "dogmatic", I think Awareness Watching awareness is just Self Inquiry. I do not understand why we have a problem with this method.   
After all, what the author is saying is: 1\. "You are Awareness" [Awareness is Brahman - SAT CHIT ANANDA, All  
Scriptures say this]   
2\. "turn away from the objects and put all attention on awareness" [Drop all  
objects and meditate on Brahman alone].   
3. "Rest in awareness" [Let the "I" remain with its source]   
I do not see any problem with this teaching. How many amongst us are really  
convinced that "I am Awareness" ?   
Why are we not convinced, if we are not? Ramana said it, Scriptures say it !   
This person, I am not aware of his actual life style, is just saying turn away  
from all objects and remain as Self.   
When a thought comes "I am hurt", revert attention to that which is aware of  
this. Though the wordings may sound different this is EXACTLY SELF INQUIRY.   
Observing awareness is not Self inquiry. But detaching from everything and  
remaining as Awareness is Summa Iru - JUST BE. Only problem will be mind will  
not allow it, it moves out. So the practice is to bring it back to the  
Awareness.   
Sitting meditation or sitting with closed eyes will be useful intially. But  
eventually it has to be 24 hours, eyes open or closed.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Mr.Snow,   
 It is clear from the reply given by bhagavan that it is difficult to introvert the mind with eyes open. When you keep the eyes open, not only the thought of objects seen by eye comes up in mind and disturbs u,but also thought of past and future comes up in mind. if you close your eyes, only thoughts of past and future will haunt you..So it is better to keep eyes closed instead open so that you have only one distraction instead of two..May be that a very advanced sadhaka will be able to meditate with eyes open but I have not so far seen in meditation hall of Ramanasramam any serious and sincere sadhaka meditating with eyes open.For that matter majority of peoplemeditate with eyes closed.That is the reason Mr.Langford has suggested to close the eyes.Bhagavan himself has told that what is important is to turn our attention inwards and it does not matter whether the eye is open or closed during meditation.   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or  
not like this: A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes   
it happens that when the eyes are closed the latent thoughts rush forth with

Ashtavakra Gita says : Yadi deham prtak kritya, chitti vishramya tistasi   
adhunaiva sukam shantam, bandha mukto bhavishyasi   
if you detach yourself from "Body" [including mind], and remain resting in  
Awareness   
Very soon [immediately ?], you shall find Bliss, Peace and release from all  
bondage.   
Relax into Awareness and detach from all external objects mentally.   
This is sadhana... A Valid method in all.   
Many people may have objection to his classification of saints. Some times  
saying Ramesh balsekar's teachings are not correct and some times about  
Lucknow. I am not sure why he makes these comments but i have my own  
agreements and disagreements on these mundane aspects.   
The method however is perfect.   
That said, is it the fastest method? I am not sure. A Bhakta might benefit  
from Surrender. But Self inquiry is not different from the method he is  
teaching.

Dear everyone,   
If one can take Awareness Wathing Awarness is Being Awareness,   
all problems do get solved.   
In another paragraph of the article of Michael Langford, I believe   
that he had said that there are 10 methods. This again poses   
problem. There is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being  
still.   
I checked up Michael James who has worked with Sri Sadhu Om,   
and who has thoroughly learnt Tamizh. He says about the   
practice and number of hours: 1\. There is no fixed time. One can keep regularity of say half an hour or 1  
hour per day. This may be increased in course of time.   
2\. During other times, one should do either work for his livelihood   
or necessity but not turn the mind outwards towards unwanted things., like  
watching the road, watching other people, watching   
useless programmes in TV or reading worthless books etc.,   
3. Regarding closed eyes and open eyes, Bhagavan Ramana said to Annamalai Swami that closing the eyes, would keep the mind free, without using the senses, and so the mind will be more vigorous   
in thinking about various things. It is like throwing a ball on a wall, by  
standing closer to the wall, the ball would bounce back more vigorously since  
the distance to be covered would be less. Keeping the eyes open, can at least  
tell you that you mind is going outwards and seeing things that are worthless.  
The mind plus   
open eyes is better controlled than the mind plus shut eyes.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Summa iru, is not a method.   
when i am not summa iru. .. i will do inquiry, who is not just be state? That  
dissolves the "i" and i just AM.   
Dissolution of "I" can happen various ways. Listen to Arunachala Siva. That is  
Self inquiry too, coz the i dissolves leaving u summa iru.   
Self surrender through Love of God. .. Listening to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is  
also Self inquiry, coz it just dissolves the "I" and leaves one as Self.   
How many ways are there to fall asleep ? One would suggest have a pillow.  
Another would suggest have a good bed. Someone may say. .. just get tired!   
Get Tired with the world   
The method if "Awareness Watching Awareness" is Mind watching Siva. Like Nandi  
watching Siva. Turning away from the world and placing the mind on Awareness  
is indeed Self inquiry. Slowly mind merges in that Awareness. Coz it has  
nothing else. When my attention is on an object, the mind merges with that. ..  
when turned towards Self, its mind turned inwards.   
We all wrote on similar lines elsewhere. .. Please dont mind this, I feel : saying that this method is wrong appears to me to be the scholar problem. If  
you see a group of 10 scholars, they will not agree to each other. they might  
be talking the same thing, but still keep saying the other is wrong !!

Dear srkudai,   
Muruganar says in Padamalai Verse 2399: Through His gentle smile, radiant Padam joyfully declares: "Why   
this distress? Be happy by just REMAINING till".   
This can also be viewed in the context of the following from   
Maharshi's Gospel: Bhagavan: Your duty is to be, and not to be this or that. 'I am   
that I am' sums up the whole truth. THE METHOD IS SUMMARIZED IN 'BE STILL'.   
And what does stillness mean? It means 'destroy yourself', because, every  
name and form is the cause of trouble. 'I-I' is   
the Self. 'I am this' is the ego. When the 'I' is kept up as the   
'I' only, it is the Self. When it flies off at a tangent and says,   
'I am this or that', I am such and such', it is the ego.   
Verse 1217: Since becoming established in the state of the Self is both the  
means and the goal to be attained, remain still.   
Talks No. 322 is as under:-   
Question: What should one do in order to remain free from thoughts as advised  
by you? Is it only enquiry 'Who am I?'   
Bhagavan: Only to remain still. Do it and see.   
Question: It is impossible.   
Bhagavan: Exactly. For the same reason, the enquiry 'Who am I?' is advised.   
Verse 2328: The wonderful meaning of the supreme world [summa iru] is to know  
and rest in the Atma Swarupa through the enquriy   
'Who am I?'   
Verse 2114: Except by remaining still [summa iruttal] by what great tapas can  
the Atma Swarupam be attained in the Heart?   
Arunachala Siva.

I find there to be some contradictions between Sri Bhagavan's and Michael  
Langford's teachings. Michael Langford says that awareness watching awareness  
should be always done eyes shut, but Sri Bhagavan said that it is totally  
immaterial in Self-Enquiry and actually sometimes advised vichara to be done  
eyes open.   
Also, here is a dialogue with Sri Bhagavan and a questioner: D.: I do not understand what I should do.   
M: **If it is anything objective the way can be shown objectively. This   
is subjective.**   
D.: But I do not understand.   
M.: What! Do you not understand that you are?   
D.: Please tell me the way.   
M.: **Is it necessary to show the way in the interior of your own home?   
This is within you.**   
And here is another one   
D: "How to make the Quest, Who am I?   
M: " **The way is subjective, not objective; so it cannot and need not be  
shown by another**. Is it necessary to show anyone the way inside his own  
house? If the seeker keeps his mind still, that will be enough."   
Michael Langford however, gives atleast ten descriptions of his practice.

Dear snow,   
I agree with you. The problem with commentators is that they   
vitiate the essence of original message of the Master. For example,   
take Sri Sankara. He said Advaitam, the One without a second.   
But his followers were trying to out-do Sri Sankara. Subsequently,   
as one may see in Panchadasi and other works, there are two schools under Sri  
Sankara, the Bamati School and the Bhatta School. One says that one will have  
still the sports of Maya veiling him, till he attains videha kaivalyam, that  
is leaving the body in liberated state. The other school says Maya stops the  
sports, once you kill the ego, which is only Maya-swarupam. Both have a set  
of arguments to support their views. The whole essence of Advaitam is lost in  
this lingual diarrohea of commentators. If one attains   
advaitic siddhi, one should stop commenting. If you start addressing someone  
as different from you, you accept duality.   
Arunachala Siva.

Ongoing through the comments on Awareness Watching Awareness of Micheal  
Langford,doubts are expressed by members of this forum that awareness  
watching awareness cannot be the state of BEING.If the members go through  
the complete text of Mr.Langford, it will be clear that it is same as self  
enquiry.Mr. Micheal very clearly explains that Awareness watching awareness is  
nothing but turning our attention inwards.He has categorically mentioned that  
Awareness Watching awareness is Awareness Being Awareness   
He has clarified that because of long ancient habit of looking outwards  
towards people places and things,the word watching is used in practice  
instructions and that way we take the same habit of watching the people places  
and things and we shut our eyes and turn inwards.That is why the word watching  
is used.   
My question to devotees is that whether any of the member is able to turn his  
attention inwards without effort.As for i am concerned, I am not able to turn  
my attention inwards with out effort and the moment effort is lost,  
immediately mind turns outwards.The effort is put by Ego and not by Self and  
when ego comes in, then the thinker comes into play and so the duality.When a  
question was put to bhagavan on Choiceless Awareness(effortless awareness)  
advocated by JK(which is same as state of being), Bhagavan replied that it is  
same as Summa Iru and if one can attain that state then it is fine.However  
Bhagavan says that due to age old vasanas, a person cannot attain Choiceless  
awareness without effort and hence continuous effort is   
required.Tamil being an ancient language any ideas can be expressed very  
clearly without any distortion in Tamil.Bhagavan has composed most of his  
works in Tamil.Once it is translated in other language especially english, due  
to want of proper words, the meaning gets distorted even though the author  
may like to give exact meaning.Watching also falls in that category.

Dear Mr.Snow,   
With reference to your post as above, i reproduce below in italics from  
Mr.Langford's article from the web site <http://www.dosisnet.de/awa.pd>as wrt  
to duration of practice. _To change this long habit of looking outward you  
need to practice. Spend as many hours per day practicing as you can. If you  
only practice awareness watching awareness for 30 minutes per day and spend  
the other 23 and a half hours looking outward, you will not progress very

Yes, i have read that. But as Michael Langford says, "the Awareness Watching  
Awareness Method is always to be done with the eyes closed."   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or  
not like this: A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes   
it happens that when the eyes are closed the latent thoughts rush forth with  
great vigour. It may also be difficult to   
introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of mind to do so.  
The mind is contaminated when it takes in   
objects. Otherwise, it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind  
active in its own pursuit without taking in   
external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
And here is another quote: Question: Is it enough if I spend some time in the mornings and some time in  
the evenings for this atma-vichara? Or should I do it always, even when I am  
writing or walking?   
A: What is your real nature? Is it writing, walking or being? The one  
unalterable reality is being. Until you realize that state of pure being you  
should pursue the enquiry. If once you are established in it there will be no  
further worry.No one will enquire into the source of thoughts unless thoughts  
arise. So long as you think I am walking or I am writing, enquire who does

Friends,   
 If we do not get "dogmatic", I think Awareness Watching awareness is just Self Inquiry. I do not understand why we have a problem with this method.   
After all, what the author is saying is: 1\. "You are Awareness" [Awareness is Brahman - SAT CHIT ANANDA, All  
Scriptures say this]   
2\. "turn away from the objects and put all attention on awareness" [Drop all  
objects and meditate on Brahman alone].   
3. "Rest in awareness" [Let the "I" remain with its source]   
I do not see any problem with this teaching. How many amongst us are really  
convinced that "I am Awareness" ?   
Why are we not convinced, if we are not? Ramana said it, Scriptures say it !   
This person, I am not aware of his actual life style, is just saying turn away  
from all objects and remain as Self.   
When a thought comes "I am hurt", revert attention to that which is aware of  
this. Though the wordings may sound different this is EXACTLY SELF INQUIRY.   
Observing awareness is not Self inquiry. But detaching from everything and  
remaining as Awareness is Summa Iru - JUST BE. Only problem will be mind will  
not allow it, it moves out. So the practice is to bring it back to the  
Awareness.   
Sitting meditation or sitting with closed eyes will be useful intially. But  
eventually it has to be 24 hours, eyes open or closed.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Mr.Snow,   
 It is clear from the reply given by bhagavan that it is difficult to introvert the mind with eyes open. When you keep the eyes open, not only the thought of objects seen by eye comes up in mind and disturbs u,but also thought of past and future comes up in mind. if you close your eyes, only thoughts of past and future will haunt you..So it is better to keep eyes closed instead open so that you have only one distraction instead of two..May be that a very advanced sadhaka will be able to meditate with eyes open but I have not so far seen in meditation hall of Ramanasramam any serious and sincere sadhaka meditating with eyes open.For that matter majority of peoplemeditate with eyes closed.That is the reason Mr.Langford has suggested to close the eyes.Bhagavan himself has told that what is important is to turn our attention inwards and it does not matter whether the eye is open or closed during meditation.   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or  
not like this: A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes   
it happens that when the eyes are closed the latent thoughts rush forth with  
great vigour. **It may also be difficult to   
introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of mind to do so.  
The mind is contaminated when it takes in   
objects.** Otherwise, it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the  
mind active in its own pursuit without taking in   
external impressions or thinking of other matters

Ashtavakra Gita says : Yadi deham prtak kritya, chitti vishramya tistasi   
adhunaiva sukam shantam, bandha mukto bhavishyasi   
if you detach yourself from "Body" [including mind], and remain resting in  
Awareness   
Very soon [immediately ?], you shall find Bliss, Peace and release from all  
bondage.   
Relax into Awareness and detach from all external objects mentally.   
This is sadhana... A Valid method in all.   
Many people may have objection to his classification of saints. Some times  
saying Ramesh balsekar's teachings are not correct and some times about  
Lucknow. I am not sure why he makes these comments but i have my own  
agreements and disagreements on these mundane aspects.   
The method however is perfect.   
That said, is it the fastest method? I am not sure. A Bhakta might benefit  
from Surrender. But Self inquiry is not different from the method he is  
teaching.

Dear everyone,   
If one can take Awareness Wathing Awarness is Being Awareness,   
all problems do get solved.   
In another paragraph of the article of Michael Langford, I believe   
that he had said that there are 10 methods. This again poses   
problem. There is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being  
still.   
I checked up Michael James who has worked with Sri Sadhu Om,   
and who has thoroughly learnt Tamizh. He says about the   
practice and number of hours: 1\. There is no fixed time. One can keep regularity of say half an hour or 1  
hour per day. This may be increased in course of time.   
2\. During other times, one should do either work for his livelihood   
or necessity but not turn the mind outwards towards unwanted things., like  
watching the road, watching other people, watching   
useless programmes in TV or reading worthless books etc.,   
3. Regarding closed eyes and open eyes, Bhagavan Ramana said to Annamalai Swami that closing the eyes, would keep the mind free, without using the senses, and so the mind will be more vigorous   
in thinking about various things. It is like throwing a ball on a wall, by  
standing closer to the wall, the ball would bounce back more vigorously since  
the distance to be covered would be less. Keeping the eyes open, can at least  
tell you that you mind is going outwards and seeing things that are worthless.  
The mind plus   
open eyes is better controlled than the mind plus shut eyes.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Summa iru, is not a method.   
when i am not summa iru. .. i will do inquiry, who is not just be state? That  
dissolves the "i" and i just AM.   
Dissolution of "I" can happen various ways. Listen to Arunachala Siva. That is  
Self inquiry too, coz the i dissolves leaving u summa iru.   
Self surrender through Love of God. .. Listening to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is  
also Self inquiry, coz it just dissolves the "I" and leaves one as Self.   
How many ways are there to fall asleep ? One would suggest have a pillow.  
Another would suggest have a good bed. Someone may say. .. just get tired!   
Get Tired with the world   
The method if "Awareness Watching Awareness" is Mind watching Siva. Like Nandi  
watching Siva. Turning away from the world and placing the mind on Awareness  
is indeed Self inquiry. Slowly mind merges in that Awareness. Coz it has  
nothing else. When my attention is on an object, the mind merges with that. ..  
when turned towards Self, its mind turned inwards.   
We all wrote on similar lines elsewhere. .. Please dont mind this, I feel : saying that this method is wrong appears to me to be the scholar problem. If  
you see a group of 10 scholars, they will not agree to each other. they might  
be talking the same thing, but still keep saying the other is wrong !!

Dear srkudai,   
Muruganar says in Padamalai Verse 2399: Through His gentle smile, radiant Padam joyfully declares: "Why   
this distress? Be happy by just REMAINING till".   
This can also be viewed in the context of the following from   
Maharshi's Gospel: Bhagavan: Your duty is to be, and not to be this or that. 'I am   
that I am' sums up the whole truth. THE METHOD IS SUMMARIZED IN 'BE STILL'.   
And what does stillness mean? It means 'destroy yourself', because, every  
name and form is the cause of trouble. 'I-I' is   
the Self. 'I am this' is the ego. When the 'I' is kept up as the   
'I' only, it is the Self. When it flies off at a tangent and says,   
'I am this or that', I am such and such', it is the ego.   
Verse 1217: Since becoming established in the state of the Self is both the  
means and the goal to be attained, remain still.   
Talks No. 322 is as under:-   
Question: What should one do in order to remain free from thoughts as advised  
by you? Is it only enquiry 'Who am I?'   
Bhagavan: Only to remain still. Do it and see.   
Question: It is impossible.   
Bhagavan: Exactly. For the same reason, the enquiry 'Who am I?' is advised.   
Verse 2328: The wonderful meaning of the supreme world [summa iru] is to know  
and rest in the Atma Swarupa through the enquriy   
'Who am I?'   
Verse 2114: Except by remaining still [summa iruttal] by what great tapas can  
the Atma Swarupam be attained in the Heart?   
Arunachala Siva.

I find there to be some contradictions between Sri Bhagavan's and Michael  
Langford's teachings. Michael Langford says that awareness watching awareness  
should be always done eyes shut, but Sri Bhagavan said that it is totally  
immaterial in Self-Enquiry and actually sometimes advised vichara to be done  
eyes open.   
Also, here is a dialogue with Sri Bhagavan and a questioner: D.: I do not understand what I should do.   
M: **If it is anything objective the way can be shown objectively. This   
is subjective.**   
D.: But I do not understand.   
M.: What! Do you not understand that you are?   
D.: Please tell me the way.   
M.: **Is it necessary to show the way in the interior of your own home?   
This is within you.**   
And here is another one   
D: "How to make the Quest, Who am I?   
M: " **The way is subjective, not objective; so it cannot and need not be  
shown by another**. Is it necessary to show anyone the way inside his own  
house? If the seeker keeps his mind still, that will be enough."   
Michael Langford however, gives atleast ten descriptions of his practice.

Dear snow,   
I agree with you. The problem with commentators is that they   
vitiate the essence of original message of the Master. For example,   
take Sri Sankara. He said Advaitam, the One without a second.   
But his followers were trying to out-do Sri Sankara. Subsequently,   
as one may see in Panchadasi and other works, there are two schools under Sri  
Sankara, the Bamati School and the Bhatta School. One says that one will have  
still the sports of Maya veiling him, till he attains videha kaivalyam, that  
is leaving the body in liberated state. The other school says Maya stops the  
sports, once you kill the ego, which is only Maya-swarupam. Both have a set  
of arguments to support their views. The whole essence of Advaitam is lost in  
this lingual diarrohea of commentators. If one attains   
advaitic siddhi, one should stop commenting. If you start addressing someone  
as different from you, you accept duality.   
Arunachala Siva.

Ongoing through the comments on Awareness Watching Awareness of Micheal  
Langford,doubts are expressed by members of this forum that awareness  
watching awareness cannot be the state of BEING.If the members go through  
the complete text of Mr.Langford, it will be clear that it is same as self  
enquiry.Mr. Micheal very clearly explains that Awareness watching awareness is  
nothing but turning our attention inwards.He has categorically mentioned that  
Awareness Watching awareness is Awareness Being Awareness   
He has clarified that because of long ancient habit of looking outwards  
towards people places and things,the word watching is used in practice  
instructions and that way we take the same habit of watching the people places  
and things and we shut our eyes and turn inwards.That is why the word watching  
is used.   
My question to devotees is that whether any of the member is able to turn his  
attention inwards without effort.As for i am concerned, I am not able to turn  
my attention inwards with out effort and the moment effort is lost,  
immediately mind turns outwards.The effort is put by Ego and not by Self and  
when ego comes in, then the thinker comes into play and so the duality.When a  
question was put to bhagavan on Choiceless Awareness(effortless awareness)  
advocated by JK(which is same as state of being), Bhagavan replied that it is  
same as Summa Iru and if one can attain that state then it is fine.However  
Bhagavan says that due to age old vasanas, a person cannot attain Choiceless  
awareness without effort and hence continuous effort is   
required.Tamil being an ancient language any ideas can be expressed very  
clearly without any distortion in Tamil.Bhagavan has composed most of his  
works in Tamil.Once it is translated in other language especially english, due  
to want of proper words, the meaning gets distorted even though the author  
may like to give exact meaning.Watching also falls in that category.

Dear Mr.Snow,   
With reference to your post as above, i reproduce below in italics from  
Mr.Langford's article from the web site <http://www.dosisnet.de/awa.pd>as wrt  
to duration of practice. _To change this long habit of looking outward you  
need to practice. Spend as many hours per day practicing as you can. If you  
only practice awareness watching awareness for 30 minutes per day and spend  
the other 23 and a half hours looking outward, you will not progress very

From the above it is evident that Mr.Langford is inline with Bhagaan wrt

Yes, i have read that. But as Michael Langford says, "the Awareness Watching

and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes   
it happens that when the eyes are closed the latent thoughts rush forth with

The mind is contaminated when it takes in

And here is another quote: Question: Is it enough if I spend some time in the mornings and some time in  
the evenings for this atma-vichara? Or should I do it always, even when I am  
writing or walking?   
A: What is your real nature? Is it writing, walking or being? The one  
unalterable reality is being. Until you realize that state of pure being you  
should pursue the enquiry. If once you are established in it there will be no  
further worry.No one will enquire into the source of thoughts unless thoughts  
arise. So long as you think I am walking or I am writing, enquire who does  
it.

Friends,   
 If we do not get "dogmatic", I think Awareness Watching awareness is just Self Inquiry. I do not understand why we have a problem with this method.   
After all, what the author is saying is: 1\. "You are Awareness" [Awareness is Brahman - SAT CHIT ANANDA, All  
Scriptures say this]   
2\. "turn away from the objects and put all attention on awareness" [Drop all  
objects and meditate on Brahman alone].   
3. "Rest in awareness" [Let the "I" remain with its source]   
I do not see any problem with this teaching. How many amongst us are really  
convinced that "I am Awareness" ?   
Why are we not convinced, if we are not? Ramana said it, Scriptures say it !   
This person, I am not aware of his actual life style, is just saying turn away  
from all objects and remain as Self.   
When a thought comes "I am hurt", revert attention to that which is aware of  
this. Though the wordings may sound different this is EXACTLY SELF INQUIRY.   
Observing awareness is not Self inquiry. But detaching from everything and  
remaining as Awareness is Summa Iru - JUST BE. Only problem will be mind will  
not allow it, it moves out. So the practice is to bring it back to the  
Awareness.   
Sitting meditation or sitting with closed eyes will be useful intially. But  
eventually it has to be 24 hours, eyes open or closed.   
Love!

Dear Mr.Snow,   
 It is clear from the reply given by bhagavan that it is difficult to introvert the mind with eyes open. When you keep the eyes open, not only the thought of objects seen by eye comes up in mind and disturbs u,but also thought of past and future comes up in mind. if you close your eyes, only thoughts of past and future will haunt you..So it is better to keep eyes closed instead open so that you have only one distraction instead of two..May be that a very advanced sadhaka will be able to meditate with eyes open but I have not so far seen in meditation hall of Ramanasramam any serious and sincere sadhaka meditating with eyes open.For that matter majority of peoplemeditate with eyes closed.That is the reason Mr.Langford has suggested to close the eyes.Bhagavan himself has told that what is important is to turn our attention inwards and it does not matter whether the eye is open or closed during meditation.   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or  
not like this: A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes   
it happens that when the eyes are closed the latent thoughts rush forth with  
great vigour. **It may also be difficult to   
introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of mind to do so.  
The mind is contaminated when it takes in   
objects.** Otherwise, it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the  
mind active in its own pursuit without taking in   
external impressions or thinking of other matters

Ashtavakra Gita says : Yadi deham prtak kritya, chitti vishramya tistasi   
adhunaiva sukam shantam, bandha mukto bhavishyasi   
if you detach yourself from "Body" [including mind], and remain resting in  
Awareness   
Very soon [immediately ?], you shall find Bliss, Peace and release from all  
bondage.   
Relax into Awareness and detach from all external objects mentally.   
This is sadhana... A Valid method in all.   
Many people may have objection to his classification of saints. Some times  
saying Ramesh balsekar's teachings are not correct and some times about  
Lucknow. I am not sure why he makes these comments but i have my own  
agreements and disagreements on these mundane aspects.   
The method however is perfect.   
That said, is it the fastest method? I am not sure. A Bhakta might benefit  
from Surrender. But Self inquiry is not different from the method he is  
teaching.   
Love!

Dear everyone,   
If one can take Awareness Wathing Awarness is Being Awareness,   
all problems do get solved.   
In another paragraph of the article of Michael Langford, I believe   
that he had said that there are 10 methods. This again poses   
problem. There is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being  
still.   
I checked up Michael James who has worked with Sri Sadhu Om,   
and who has thoroughly learnt Tamizh. He says about the   
practice and number of hours: 1\. There is no fixed time. One can keep regularity of say half an hour or 1  
hour per day. This may be increased in course of time.   
2\. During other times, one should do either work for his livelihood   
or necessity but not turn the mind outwards towards unwanted things., like  
watching the road, watching other people, watching   
useless programmes in TV or reading worthless books etc.,   
3. Regarding closed eyes and open eyes, Bhagavan Ramana said to Annamalai Swami that closing the eyes, would keep the mind free, without using the senses, and so the mind will be more vigorous   
in thinking about various things. It is like throwing a ball on a wall, by  
standing closer to the wall, the ball would bounce back more vigorously since  
the distance to be covered would be less. Keeping the eyes open, can at least  
tell you that you mind is going outwards and seeing things that are worthless.  
The mind plus   
open eyes is better controlled than the mind plus shut eyes.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Summa iru, is not a method.   
when i am not summa iru. .. i will do inquiry, who is not just be state? That  
dissolves the "i" and i just AM.   
Dissolution of "I" can happen various ways. Listen to Arunachala Siva. That is  
Self inquiry too, coz the i dissolves leaving u summa iru.   
Self surrender through Love of God. .. Listening to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is  
also Self inquiry, coz it just dissolves the "I" and leaves one as Self.   
How many ways are there to fall asleep ? One would suggest have a pillow.  
Another would suggest have a good bed. Someone may say. .. just get tired!   
Get Tired with the world   
The method if "Awareness Watching Awareness" is Mind watching Siva. Like Nandi  
watching Siva. Turning away from the world and placing the mind on Awareness  
is indeed Self inquiry. Slowly mind merges in that Awareness. Coz it has  
nothing else. When my attention is on an object, the mind merges with that. ..  
when turned towards Self, its mind turned inwards.   
We all wrote on similar lines elsewhere. .. Please dont mind this, I feel : saying that this method is wrong appears to me to be the scholar problem. If  
you see a group of 10 scholars, they will not agree to each other. they might  
be talking the same thing, but still keep saying the other is wrong !!

Dear srkudai,   
Muruganar says in Padamalai Verse 2399: Through His gentle smile, radiant Padam joyfully declares: "Why   
this distress? Be happy by just REMAINING till".   
This can also be viewed in the context of the following from   
Maharshi's Gospel: Bhagavan: Your duty is to be, and not to be this or that. 'I am   
that I am' sums up the whole truth. THE METHOD IS SUMMARIZED IN 'BE STILL'.   
And what does stillness mean? It means 'destroy yourself', because, every  
name and form is the cause of trouble. 'I-I' is   
the Self. 'I am this' is the ego. When the 'I' is kept up as the   
'I' only, it is the Self. When it flies off at a tangent and says,   
'I am this or that', I am such and such', it is the ego.   
Verse 1217: Since becoming established in the state of the Self is both the  
means and the goal to be attained, remain still.   
Talks No. 322 is as under:-   
Question: What should one do in order to remain free from thoughts as advised  
by you? Is it only enquiry 'Who am I?'   
Bhagavan: Only to remain still. Do it and see.   
Question: It is impossible.   
Bhagavan: Exactly. For the same reason, the enquiry 'Who am I?' is advised.   
Verse 2328: The wonderful meaning of the supreme world [summa iru] is to know  
and rest in the Atma Swarupa through the enquriy   
'Who am I?'   
Verse 2114: Except by remaining still [summa iruttal] by what great tapas can  
the Atma Swarupam be attained in the Heart?   
Arunachala Siva.

I find there to be some contradictions between Sri Bhagavan's and Michael  
Langford's teachings. Michael Langford says that awareness watching awareness  
should be always done eyes shut, but Sri Bhagavan said that it is totally  
immaterial in Self-Enquiry and actually sometimes advised vichara to be done  
eyes open.   
Also, here is a dialogue with Sri Bhagavan and a questioner: D.: I do not understand what I should do.   
M: **If it is anything objective the way can be shown objectively. This   
is subjective.**   
D.: But I do not understand.   
M.: What! Do you not understand that you are?   
D.: Please tell me the way.   
M.: **Is it necessary to show the way in the interior of your own home?   
This is within you.**   
And here is another one   
D: "How to make the Quest, Who am I?   
M: " **The way is subjective, not objective; so it cannot and need not be  
shown by another**. Is it necessary to show anyone the way inside his own  
house? If the seeker keeps his mind still, that will be enough."   
Michael Langford however, gives atleast ten descriptions of his practice.

Dear snow,   
I agree with you. The problem with commentators is that they   
vitiate the essence of original message of the Master. For example,   
take Sri Sankara. He said Advaitam, the One without a second.   
But his followers were trying to out-do Sri Sankara. Subsequently,   
as one may see in Panchadasi and other works, there are two schools under Sri  
Sankara, the Bamati School and the Bhatta School. One says that one will have  
still the sports of Maya veiling him, till he attains videha kaivalyam, that  
is leaving the body in liberated state. The other school says Maya stops the  
sports, once you kill the ego, which is only Maya-swarupam. Both have a set  
of arguments to support their views. The whole essence of Advaitam is lost in  
this lingual diarrohea of commentators. If one attains   
advaitic siddhi, one should stop commenting. If you start addressing someone  
as different from you, you accept duality.   
Arunachala Siva.

Ongoing through the comments on Awareness Watching Awareness of Micheal  
Langford,doubts are expressed by members of this forum that awareness  
watching awareness cannot be the state of BEING.If the members go through  
the complete text of Mr.Langford, it will be clear that it is same as self  
enquiry.Mr. Micheal very clearly explains that Awareness watching awareness is  
nothing but turning our attention inwards.He has categorically mentioned that  
Awareness Watching awareness is Awareness Being Awareness   
He has clarified that because of long ancient habit of looking outwards  
towards people places and things,the word watching is used in practice  
instructions and that way we take the same habit of watching the people places  
and things and we shut our eyes and turn inwards.That is why the word watching  
is used.   
My question to devotees is that whether any of the member is able to turn his  
attention inwards without effort.As for i am concerned, I am not able to turn  
my attention inwards with out effort and the moment effort is lost,  
immediately mind turns outwards.The effort is put by Ego and not by Self and  
when ego comes in, then the thinker comes into play and so the duality.When a  
question was put to bhagavan on Choiceless Awareness(effortless awareness)  
advocated by JK(which is same as state of being), Bhagavan replied that it is  
same as Summa Iru and if one can attain that state then it is fine.However  
Bhagavan says that due to age old vasanas, a person cannot attain Choiceless  
awareness without effort and hence continuous effort is   
required.Tamil being an ancient language any ideas can be expressed very  
clearly without any distortion in Tamil.Bhagavan has composed most of his  
works in Tamil.Once it is translated in other language especially english, due  
to want of proper words, the meaning gets distorted even though the author  
may like to give exact meaning.Watching also falls in that category.

Dear Mr.Snow,   
With reference to your post as above, i reproduce below in italics from  
Mr.Langford's article from the web site <http://www.dosisnet.de/awa.pd>as wrt  
to duration of practice. _To change this long habit of looking outward you  
need to practice. Spend as many hours per day practicing as you can. If you  
only practice awareness watching awareness for 30 minutes per day and spend  
the other 23 and a half hours looking outward, you will not progress very

From the above it is evident that Mr.Langford is inline with Bhagaan wrt

Yes, i have read that. But as Michael Langford says, "the Awareness Watching  
Awareness Method is always to be done with the eyes closed."   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or  
not like this: A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes   
it happens that when the eyes are closed the latent thoughts rush forth with

The mind is contaminated when it takes in   
objects. Otherwise, it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind  
active in its own pursuit without taking in   
external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
And here is another quote: Question: Is it enough if I spend some time in the mornings and some time in  
the evenings for this atma-vichara? Or should I do it always, even when I am  
writing or walking?   
A: What is your real nature? Is it writing, walking or being? The one  
unalterable reality is being. Until you realize that state of pure being you  
should pursue the enquiry. If once you are established in it there will be no  
further worry.No one will enquire into the source of thoughts unless thoughts  
arise. So long as you think I am walking or I am writing, enquire who does  
it.

Friends,   
 If we do not get "dogmatic", I think Awareness Watching awareness is just Self Inquiry. I do not understand why we have a problem with this method.   
After all, what the author is saying is: 1\. "You are Awareness" [Awareness is Brahman - SAT CHIT ANANDA, All  
Scriptures say this]   
2\. "turn away from the objects and put all attention on awareness" [Drop all  
objects and meditate on Brahman alone].   
3. "Rest in awareness" [Let the "I" remain with its source]   
I do not see any problem with this teaching. How many amongst us are really  
convinced that "I am Awareness" ?   
Why are we not convinced, if we are not? Ramana said it, Scriptures say it !   
This person, I am not aware of his actual life style, is just saying turn away  
from all objects and remain as Self.   
When a thought comes "I am hurt", revert attention to that which is aware of  
this. Though the wordings may sound different this is EXACTLY SELF INQUIRY.   
Observing awareness is not Self inquiry. But detaching from everything and  
remaining as Awareness is Summa Iru - JUST BE. Only problem will be mind will  
not allow it, it moves out. So the practice is to bring it back to the  
Awareness.   
Sitting meditation or sitting with closed eyes will be useful intially. But  
eventually it has to be 24 hours, eyes open or closed.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Mr.Snow,   
 It is clear from the reply given by bhagavan that it is difficult to introvert the mind with eyes open. When you keep the eyes open, not only the thought of objects seen by eye comes up in mind and disturbs u,but also thought of past and future comes up in mind. if you close your eyes, only thoughts of past and future will haunt you..So it is better to keep eyes closed instead open so that you have only one distraction instead of two..May be that a very advanced sadhaka will be able to meditate with eyes open but I have not so far seen in meditation hall of Ramanasramam any serious and sincere sadhaka meditating with eyes open.For that matter majority of peoplemeditate with eyes closed.That is the reason Mr.Langford has suggested to close the eyes.Bhagavan himself has told that what is important is to turn our attention inwards and it does not matter whether the eye is open or closed during meditation.   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or

Ashtavakra Gita says : Yadi deham prtak kritya, chitti vishramya tistasi   
adhunaiva sukam shantam, bandha mukto bhavishyasi   
if you detach yourself from "Body" [including mind], and remain resting in  
Awareness   
Very soon [immediately ?], you shall find Bliss, Peace and release from all  
bondage.   
Relax into Awareness and detach from all external objects mentally.   
This is sadhana... A Valid method in all.   
Many people may have objection to his classification of saints. Some times  
saying Ramesh balsekar's teachings are not correct and some times about  
Lucknow. I am not sure why he makes these comments but i have my own  
agreements and disagreements on these mundane aspects.   
The method however is perfect.   
That said, is it the fastest method? I am not sure. A Bhakta might benefit  
from Surrender. But Self inquiry is not different from the method he is  
teaching.   
Love!

Dear everyone,   
If one can take Awareness Wathing Awarness is Being Awareness,   
all problems do get solved.   
In another paragraph of the article of Michael Langford, I believe   
that he had said that there are 10 methods. This again poses   
problem. There is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being  
still.   
I checked up Michael James who has worked with Sri Sadhu Om,   
and who has thoroughly learnt Tamizh. He says about the   
practice and number of hours: 1\. There is no fixed time. One can keep regularity of say half an hour or 1  
hour per day. This may be increased in course of time.   
2\. During other times, one should do either work for his livelihood   
or necessity but not turn the mind outwards towards unwanted things., like  
watching the road, watching other people, watching   
useless programmes in TV or reading worthless books etc.,   
3. Regarding closed eyes and open eyes, Bhagavan Ramana said to Annamalai Swami that closing the eyes, would keep the mind free, without using the senses, and so the mind will be more vigorous   
in thinking about various things. It is like throwing a ball on a wall, by  
standing closer to the wall, the ball would bounce back more vigorously since  
the distance to be covered would be less. Keeping the eyes open, can at least  
tell you that you mind is going outwards and seeing things that are worthless.  
The mind plus   
open eyes is better controlled than the mind plus shut eyes.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Summa iru, is not a method.   
when i am not summa iru. .. i will do inquiry, who is not just be state? That  
dissolves the "i" and i just AM.   
Dissolution of "I" can happen various ways. Listen to Arunachala Siva. That is  
Self inquiry too, coz the i dissolves leaving u summa iru.   
Self surrender through Love of God. .. Listening to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is  
also Self inquiry, coz it just dissolves the "I" and leaves one as Self.   
How many ways are there to fall asleep ? One would suggest have a pillow.  
Another would suggest have a good bed. Someone may say. .. just get tired!   
Get Tired with the world   
The method if "Awareness Watching Awareness" is Mind watching Siva. Like Nandi  
watching Siva. Turning away from the world and placing the mind on Awareness  
is indeed Self inquiry. Slowly mind merges in that Awareness. Coz it has  
nothing else. When my attention is on an object, the mind merges with that. ..  
when turned towards Self, its mind turned inwards.   
We all wrote on similar lines elsewhere. .. Please dont mind this, I feel : saying that this method is wrong appears to me to be the scholar problem. If  
you see a group of 10 scholars, they will not agree to each other. they might  
be talking the same thing, but still keep saying the other is wrong !!

Dear srkudai,   
Muruganar says in Padamalai Verse 2399: Through His gentle smile, radiant Padam joyfully declares: "Why   
this distress? Be happy by just REMAINING till".   
This can also be viewed in the context of the following from   
Maharshi's Gospel: Bhagavan: Your duty is to be, and not to be this or that. 'I am   
that I am' sums up the whole truth. THE METHOD IS SUMMARIZED IN 'BE STILL'.   
And what does stillness mean? It means 'destroy yourself', because, every  
name and form is the cause of trouble. 'I-I' is   
the Self. 'I am this' is the ego. When the 'I' is kept up as the   
'I' only, it is the Self. When it flies off at a tangent and says,   
'I am this or that', I am such and such', it is the ego.   
Verse 1217: Since becoming established in the state of the Self is both the  
means and the goal to be attained, remain still.   
Talks No. 322 is as under:-   
Question: What should one do in order to remain free from thoughts as advised  
by you? Is it only enquiry 'Who am I?'   
Bhagavan: Only to remain still. Do it and see.   
Question: It is impossible.   
Bhagavan: Exactly. For the same reason, the enquiry 'Who am I?' is advised.   
Verse 2328: The wonderful meaning of the supreme world [summa iru] is to know  
and rest in the Atma Swarupa through the enquriy   
'Who am I?'   
Verse 2114: Except by remaining still [summa iruttal] by what great tapas can  
the Atma Swarupam be attained in the Heart?   
Arunachala Siva.

I find there to be some contradictions between Sri Bhagavan's and Michael  
Langford's teachings. Michael Langford says that awareness watching awareness  
should be always done eyes shut, but Sri Bhagavan said that it is totally  
immaterial in Self-Enquiry and actually sometimes advised vichara to be done  
eyes open.   
Also, here is a dialogue with Sri Bhagavan and a questioner: D.: I do not understand what I should do.   
M: **If it is anything objective the way can be shown objectively. This   
is subjective.**   
D.: But I do not understand.   
M.: What! Do you not understand that you are?   
D.: Please tell me the way.   
M.: **Is it necessary to show the way in the interior of your own home?   
This is within you.**   
And here is another one   
D: "How to make the Quest, Who am I?   
M: " **The way is subjective, not objective; so it cannot and need not be  
shown by another**. Is it necessary to show anyone the way inside his own  
house? If the seeker keeps his mind still, that will be enough."   
Michael Langford however, gives atleast ten descriptions of his practice.

Dear snow,   
I agree with you. The problem with commentators is that they   
vitiate the essence of original message of the Master. For example,   
take Sri Sankara. He said Advaitam, the One without a second.   
But his followers were trying to out-do Sri Sankara. Subsequently,   
as one may see in Panchadasi and other works, there are two schools under Sri  
Sankara, the Bamati School and the Bhatta School. One says that one will have  
still the sports of Maya veiling him, till he attains videha kaivalyam, that  
is leaving the body in liberated state. The other school says Maya stops the  
sports, once you kill the ego, which is only Maya-swarupam. Both have a set  
of arguments to support their views. The whole essence of Advaitam is lost in  
this lingual diarrohea of commentators. If one attains   
advaitic siddhi, one should stop commenting. If you start addressing someone  
as different from you, you accept duality.   
Arunachala Siva.

Ongoing through the comments on Awareness Watching Awareness of Micheal  
Langford,doubts are expressed by members of this forum that awareness  
watching awareness cannot be the state of BEING.If the members go through  
the complete text of Mr.Langford, it will be clear that it is same as self  
enquiry.Mr. Micheal very clearly explains that Awareness watching awareness is  
nothing but turning our attention inwards.He has categorically mentioned that  
Awareness Watching awareness is Awareness Being Awareness   
He has clarified that because of long ancient habit of looking outwards  
towards people places and things,the word watching is used in practice  
instructions and that way we take the same habit of watching the people places  
and things and we shut our eyes and turn inwards.That is why the word watching  
is used.   
My question to devotees is that whether any of the member is able to turn his  
attention inwards without effort.As for i am concerned, I am not able to turn  
my attention inwards with out effort and the moment effort is lost,  
immediately mind turns outwards.The effort is put by Ego and not by Self and  
when ego comes in, then the thinker comes into play and so the duality.When a  
question was put to bhagavan on Choiceless Awareness(effortless awareness)  
advocated by JK(which is same as state of being), Bhagavan replied that it is  
same as Summa Iru and if one can attain that state then it is fine.However  
Bhagavan says that due to age old vasanas, a person cannot attain Choiceless  
awareness without effort and hence continuous effort is   
required.Tamil being an ancient language any ideas can be expressed very  
clearly without any distortion in Tamil.Bhagavan has composed most of his  
works in Tamil.Once it is translated in other language especially english, due  
to want of proper words, the meaning gets distorted even though the author  
may like to give exact meaning.Watching also falls in that category.

Dear Mr.Snow,   
With reference to your post as above, i reproduce below in italics from  
Mr.Langford's article from the web site <http://www.dosisnet.de/awa.pd>as wrt  
to duration of practice. _To change this long habit of looking outward you  
need to practice. Spend as many hours per day practicing as you can. If you  
only practice awareness watching awareness for 30 minutes per day and spend  
the other 23 and a half hours looking outward, you will not progress very  
quickly_   
From the above it is evident that Mr.Langford is inline with Bhagaan wrt  
duration of practice.

Yes, i have read that. But as Michael Langford says, "the Awareness Watching  
Awareness Method is always to be done with the eyes closed."   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or  
not like this: A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes   
it happens that when the eyes are closed the latent thoughts rush forth with  
great vigour. It may also be difficult to   
introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of mind to do so.  
The mind is contaminated when it takes in   
objects. Otherwise, it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind  
active in its own pursuit without taking in   
external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
And here is another quote: Question: Is it enough if I spend some time in the mornings and some time in  
the evenings for this atma-vichara? Or should I do it always, even when I am  
writing or walking?   
A: What is your real nature? Is it writing, walking or being? The one  
unalterable reality is being. Until you realize that state of pure being you  
should pursue the enquiry. If once you are established in it there will be no  
further worry.No one will enquire into the source of thoughts unless thoughts  
arise. So long as you think I am walking or I am writing, enquire who does  
it.

Friends,   
 If we do not get "dogmatic", I think Awareness Watching awareness is just Self Inquiry. I do not understand why we have a problem with this method.   
After all, what the author is saying is: 1\. "You are Awareness" [Awareness is Brahman - SAT CHIT ANANDA, All  
Scriptures say this]   
2\. "turn away from the objects and put all attention on awareness" [Drop all  
objects and meditate on Brahman alone].   
3. "Rest in awareness" [Let the "I" remain with its source]   
I do not see any problem with this teaching. How many amongst us are really  
convinced that "I am Awareness" ?   
Why are we not convinced, if we are not? Ramana said it, Scriptures say it !   
This person, I am not aware of his actual life style, is just saying turn away  
from all objects and remain as Self.   
When a thought comes "I am hurt", revert attention to that which is aware of  
this. Though the wordings may sound different this is EXACTLY SELF INQUIRY.   
Observing awareness is not Self inquiry. But detaching from everything and  
remaining as Awareness is Summa Iru - JUST BE. Only problem will be mind will  
not allow it, it moves out. So the practice is to bring it back to the  
Awareness.   
Sitting meditation or sitting with closed eyes will be useful intially. But  
eventually it has to be 24 hours, eyes open or closed.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Mr.Snow,   
 It is clear from the reply given by bhagavan that it is difficult to introvert the mind with eyes open. When you keep the eyes open, not only the thought of objects seen by eye comes up in mind and disturbs u,but also thought of past and future comes up in mind. if you close your eyes, only thoughts of past and future will haunt you..So it is better to keep eyes closed instead open so that you have only one distraction instead of two..May be that a very advanced sadhaka will be able to meditate with eyes open but I have not so far seen in meditation hall of Ramanasramam any serious and sincere sadhaka meditating with eyes open.For that matter majority of peoplemeditate with eyes closed.That is the reason Mr.Langford has suggested to close the eyes.Bhagavan himself has told that what is important is to turn our attention inwards and it does not matter whether the eye is open or closed during meditation.   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or  
not like this: A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted

In another paragraph of the article of Michael Langford, I believe   
that he had said that there are 10 methods. This again poses   
problem. There is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being  
still.   
I checked up Michael James who has worked with Sri Sadhu Om,   
and who has thoroughly learnt Tamizh. He says about the   
practice and number of hours: 1\. There is no fixed time. One can keep regularity of say half an hour or 1  
hour per day. This may be increased in course of time.   
2\. During other times, one should do either work for his livelihood   
or necessity but not turn the mind outwards towards unwanted things., like  
watching the road, watching other people, watching   
useless programmes in TV or reading worthless books etc.,   
3. Regarding closed eyes and open eyes, Bhagavan Ramana said to Annamalai Swami that closing the eyes, would keep the mind free, without using the senses, and so the mind will be more vigorous   
in thinking about various things. It is like throwing a ball on a wall, by  
standing closer to the wall, the ball would bounce back more vigorously since  
the distance to be covered would be less. Keeping the eyes open, can at least  
tell you that you mind is going outwards and seeing things that are worthless.  
The mind plus   
open eyes is better controlled than the mind plus shut eyes.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Summa iru, is not a method.   
when i am not summa iru. .. i will do inquiry, who is not just be state? That  
dissolves the "i" and i just AM.   
Dissolution of "I" can happen various ways. Listen to Arunachala Siva. That is  
Self inquiry too, coz the i dissolves leaving u summa iru.   
Self surrender through Love of God. .. Listening to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is  
also Self inquiry, coz it just dissolves the "I" and leaves one as Self.   
How many ways are there to fall asleep ? One would suggest have a pillow.  
Another would suggest have a good bed. Someone may say. .. just get tired!   
Get Tired with the world   
The method if "Awareness Watching Awareness" is Mind watching Siva. Like Nandi  
watching Siva. Turning away from the world and placing the mind on Awareness  
is indeed Self inquiry. Slowly mind merges in that Awareness. Coz it has  
nothing else. When my attention is on an object, the mind merges with that. ..  
when turned towards Self, its mind turned inwards.   
We all wrote on similar lines elsewhere. .. Please dont mind this, I feel : saying that this method is wrong appears to me to be the scholar problem. If  
you see a group of 10 scholars, they will not agree to each other. they might  
be talking the same thing, but still keep saying the other is wrong !!   
Love!

Dear srkudai,   
Muruganar says in Padamalai Verse 2399: Through His gentle smile, radiant Padam joyfully declares: "Why   
this distress? Be happy by just REMAINING till".   
This can also be viewed in the context of the following from   
Maharshi's Gospel: Bhagavan: Your duty is to be, and not to be this or that. 'I am   
that I am' sums up the whole truth. THE METHOD IS SUMMARIZED IN 'BE STILL'.   
And what does stillness mean? It means 'destroy yourself', because, every  
name and form is the cause of trouble. 'I-I' is   
the Self. 'I am this' is the ego. When the 'I' is kept up as the   
'I' only, it is the Self. When it flies off at a tangent and says,   
'I am this or that', I am such and such', it is the ego.   
Verse 1217: Since becoming established in the state of the Self is both the  
means and the goal to be attained, remain still.   
Talks No. 322 is as under:-   
Question: What should one do in order to remain free from thoughts as advised  
by you? Is it only enquiry 'Who am I?'   
Bhagavan: Only to remain still. Do it and see.   
Question: It is impossible.   
Bhagavan: Exactly. For the same reason, the enquiry 'Who am I?' is advised.   
Verse 2328: The wonderful meaning of the supreme world [summa iru] is to know  
and rest in the Atma Swarupa through the enquriy   
'Who am I?'   
Verse 2114: Except by remaining still [summa iruttal] by what great tapas can  
the Atma Swarupam be attained in the Heart?   
Arunachala Siva.

I find there to be some contradictions between Sri Bhagavan's and Michael  
Langford's teachings. Michael Langford says that awareness watching awareness  
should be always done eyes shut, but Sri Bhagavan said that it is totally  
immaterial in Self-Enquiry and actually sometimes advised vichara to be done  
eyes open.   
Also, here is a dialogue with Sri Bhagavan and a questioner: D.: I do not understand what I should do.   
M: **If it is anything objective the way can be shown objectively. This   
is subjective.**   
D.: But I do not understand.   
M.: What! Do you not understand that you are?   
D.: Please tell me the way.   
M.: **Is it necessary to show the way in the interior of your own home?   
This is within you.**   
And here is another one   
D: "How to make the Quest, Who am I?   
M: " **The way is subjective, not objective; so it cannot and need not be  
shown by another**. Is it necessary to show anyone the way inside his own  
house? If the seeker keeps his mind still, that will be enough."   
Michael Langford however, gives atleast ten descriptions of his practice.

Dear snow,   
I agree with you. The problem with commentators is that they   
vitiate the essence of original message of the Master. For example,   
take Sri Sankara. He said Advaitam, the One without a second.   
But his followers were trying to out-do Sri Sankara. Subsequently,   
as one may see in Panchadasi and other works, there are two schools under Sri  
Sankara, the Bamati School and the Bhatta School. One says that one will have  
still the sports of Maya veiling him, till he attains videha kaivalyam, that  
is leaving the body in liberated state. The other school says Maya stops the  
sports, once you kill the ego, which is only Maya-swarupam. Both have a set  
of arguments to support their views. The whole essence of Advaitam is lost in  
this lingual diarrohea of commentators. If one attains   
advaitic siddhi, one should stop commenting. If you start addressing someone  
as different from you, you accept duality.   
Arunachala Siva.

Ongoing through the comments on Awareness Watching Awareness of Micheal  
Langford,doubts are expressed by members of this forum that awareness  
watching awareness cannot be the state of BEING.If the members go through  
the complete text of Mr.Langford, it will be clear that it is same as self  
enquiry.Mr. Micheal very clearly explains that Awareness watching awareness is  
nothing but turning our attention inwards.He has categorically mentioned that  
Awareness Watching awareness is Awareness Being Awareness   
He has clarified that because of long ancient habit of looking outwards  
towards people places and things,the word watching is used in practice  
instructions and that way we take the same habit of watching the people places  
and things and we shut our eyes and turn inwards.That is why the word watching  
is used.   
My question to devotees is that whether any of the member is able to turn his  
attention inwards without effort.As for i am concerned, I am not able to turn  
my attention inwards with out effort and the moment effort is lost,  
immediately mind turns outwards.The effort is put by Ego and not by Self and  
when ego comes in, then the thinker comes into play and so the duality.When a  
question was put to bhagavan on Choiceless Awareness(effortless awareness)  
advocated by JK(which is same as state of being), Bhagavan replied that it is  
same as Summa Iru and if one can attain that state then it is fine.However  
Bhagavan says that due to age old vasanas, a person cannot attain Choiceless  
awareness without effort and hence continuous effort is   
required.Tamil being an ancient language any ideas can be expressed very  
clearly without any distortion in Tamil.Bhagavan has composed most of his  
works in Tamil.Once it is translated in other language especially english, due  
to want of proper words, the meaning gets distorted even though the author  
may like to give exact meaning.Watching also falls in that category.

Dear Mr.Snow,   
With reference to your post as above, i reproduce below in italics from  
Mr.Langford's article from the web site <http://www.dosisnet.de/awa.pd>as wrt  
to duration of practice. _To change this long habit of looking outward you  
need to practice. Spend as many hours per day practicing as you can. If you  
only practice awareness watching awareness for 30 minutes per day and spend  
the other 23 and a half hours looking outward, you will not progress very  
quickly_   
From the above it is evident that Mr.Langford is inline with Bhagaan wrt  
duration of practice.

Yes, i have read that. But as Michael Langford says, "the Awareness Watching  
Awareness Method is always to be done with the eyes closed."   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or  
not like this: A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes   
it happens that when the eyes are closed the latent thoughts rush forth with  
great vigour. It may also be difficult to   
introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of mind to do so.  
The mind is contaminated when it takes in   
objects. Otherwise, it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind  
active in its own pursuit without taking in   
external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
And here is another quote: Question: Is it enough if I spend some time in the mornings and some time in  
the evenings for this atma-vichara? Or should I do it always, even when I am  
writing or walking?   
A: What is your real nature? Is it writing, walking or being? The one  
unalterable reality is being. Until you realize that state of pure being you  
should pursue the enquiry. If once you are established in it there will be no  
further worry.No one will enquire into the source of thoughts unless thoughts  
arise. So long as you think I am walking or I am writing, enquire who does  
it.

Friends,   
 If we do not get "dogmatic", I think Awareness Watching awareness is just Self Inquiry. I do not understand why we have a problem with this method.   
After all, what the author is saying is: 1\. "You are Awareness" [Awareness is Brahman - SAT CHIT ANANDA, All  
Scriptures say this]   
2\. "turn away from the objects and put all attention on awareness" [Drop all  
objects and meditate on Brahman alone].   
3. "Rest in awareness" [Let the "I" remain with its source]   
I do not see any problem with this teaching. How many amongst us are really  
convinced that "I am Awareness" ?   
Why are we not convinced, if we are not? Ramana said it, Scriptures say it !   
This person, I am not aware of his actual life style, is just saying turn away  
from all objects and remain as Self.   
When a thought comes "I am hurt", revert attention to that which is aware of  
this. Though the wordings may sound different this is EXACTLY SELF INQUIRY.   
Observing awareness is not Self inquiry. But detaching from everything and  
remaining as Awareness is Summa Iru - JUST BE. Only problem will be mind will  
not allow it, it moves out. So the practice is to bring it back to the  
Awareness.   
Sitting meditation or sitting with closed eyes will be useful intially. But  
eventually it has to be 24 hours, eyes open or closed.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Mr.Snow,   
 It is clear from the reply given by bhagavan that it is difficult to introvert the mind with eyes open. When you keep the eyes open, not only the thought of objects seen by eye comes up in mind and disturbs u,but also thought of past and future comes up in mind. if you close your eyes, only thoughts of past and future will haunt you..So it is better to keep eyes closed instead open so that you have only one distraction instead of two..May be that a very advanced sadhaka will be able to meditate with eyes open but I have not so far seen in meditation hall of Ramanasramam any serious and sincere sadhaka meditating with eyes open.For that matter majority of peoplemeditate with eyes closed.That is the reason Mr.Langford has suggested to close the eyes.Bhagavan himself has told that what is important is to turn our attention inwards and it does not matter whether the eye is open or closed during meditation.   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or  
not like this: A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes

Ashtavakra Gita says : Yadi deham prtak kritya, chitti vishramya tistasi   
adhunaiva sukam shantam, bandha mukto bhavishyasi   
if you detach yourself from "Body" [including mind], and remain resting in  
Awareness   
Very soon [immediately ?], you shall find Bliss, Peace and release from all  
bondage.   
Relax into Awareness and detach from all external objects mentally.   
This is sadhana... A Valid method in all.   
Many people may have objection to his classification of saints. Some times  
saying Ramesh balsekar's teachings are not correct and some times about  
Lucknow. I am not sure why he makes these comments but i have my own  
agreements and disagreements on these mundane aspects.   
The method however is perfect.   
That said, is it the fastest method? I am not sure. A Bhakta might benefit  
from Surrender. But Self inquiry is not different from the method he is  
teaching.   
Love!

Dear everyone,   
If one can take Awareness Wathing Awarness is Being Awareness,   
all problems do get solved.   
In another paragraph of the article of Michael Langford, I believe   
that he had said that there are 10 methods. This again poses   
problem. There is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being  
still.   
I checked up Michael James who has worked with Sri Sadhu Om,   
and who has thoroughly learnt Tamizh. He says about the   
practice and number of hours: 1\. There is no fixed time. One can keep regularity of say half an hour or 1  
hour per day. This may be increased in course of time.   
2\. During other times, one should do either work for his livelihood   
or necessity but not turn the mind outwards towards unwanted things., like  
watching the road, watching other people, watching   
useless programmes in TV or reading worthless books etc.,   
3. Regarding closed eyes and open eyes, Bhagavan Ramana said to Annamalai Swami that closing the eyes, would keep the mind free, without using the senses, and so the mind will be more vigorous   
in thinking about various things. It is like throwing a ball on a wall, by  
standing closer to the wall, the ball would bounce back more vigorously since  
the distance to be covered would be less. Keeping the eyes open, can at least  
tell you that you mind is going outwards and seeing things that are worthless.  
The mind plus   
open eyes is better controlled than the mind plus shut eyes.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Summa iru, is not a method.   
when i am not summa iru. .. i will do inquiry, who is not just be state? That  
dissolves the "i" and i just AM.   
Dissolution of "I" can happen various ways. Listen to Arunachala Siva. That is  
Self inquiry too, coz the i dissolves leaving u summa iru.   
Self surrender through Love of God. .. Listening to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is  
also Self inquiry, coz it just dissolves the "I" and leaves one as Self.   
How many ways are there to fall asleep ? One would suggest have a pillow.  
Another would suggest have a good bed. Someone may say. .. just get tired!   
Get Tired with the world   
The method if "Awareness Watching Awareness" is Mind watching Siva. Like Nandi  
watching Siva. Turning away from the world and placing the mind on Awareness  
is indeed Self inquiry. Slowly mind merges in that Awareness. Coz it has  
nothing else. When my attention is on an object, the mind merges with that. ..  
when turned towards Self, its mind turned inwards.   
We all wrote on similar lines elsewhere. .. Please dont mind this, I feel : saying that this method is wrong appears to me to be the scholar problem. If  
you see a group of 10 scholars, they will not agree to each other. they might  
be talking the same thing, but still keep saying the other is wrong !!   
Love!

Dear srkudai,   
Muruganar says in Padamalai Verse 2399: Through His gentle smile, radiant Padam joyfully declares: "Why   
this distress? Be happy by just REMAINING till".   
This can also be viewed in the context of the following from   
Maharshi's Gospel: Bhagavan: Your duty is to be, and not to be this or that. 'I am   
that I am' sums up the whole truth. THE METHOD IS SUMMARIZED IN 'BE STILL'.   
And what does stillness mean? It means 'destroy yourself', because, every  
name and form is the cause of trouble. 'I-I' is   
the Self. 'I am this' is the ego. When the 'I' is kept up as the   
'I' only, it is the Self. When it flies off at a tangent and says,   
'I am this or that', I am such and such', it is the ego.   
Verse 1217: Since becoming established in the state of the Self is both the  
means and the goal to be attained, remain still.   
Talks No. 322 is as under:-   
Question: What should one do in order to remain free from thoughts as advised  
by you? Is it only enquiry 'Who am I?'   
Bhagavan: Only to remain still. Do it and see.   
Question: It is impossible.   
Bhagavan: Exactly. For the same reason, the enquiry 'Who am I?' is advised.   
Verse 2328: The wonderful meaning of the supreme world [summa iru] is to know  
and rest in the Atma Swarupa through the enquriy   
'Who am I?'   
Verse 2114: Except by remaining still [summa iruttal] by what great tapas can  
the Atma Swarupam be attained in the Heart?   
Arunachala Siva.

I find there to be some contradictions between Sri Bhagavan's and Michael  
Langford's teachings. Michael Langford says that awareness watching awareness  
should be always done eyes shut, but Sri Bhagavan said that it is totally  
immaterial in Self-Enquiry and actually sometimes advised vichara to be done  
eyes open.   
Also, here is a dialogue with Sri Bhagavan and a questioner: D.: I do not understand what I should do.   
M: **If it is anything objective the way can be shown objectively. This   
is subjective.**   
D.: But I do not understand.   
M.: What! Do you not understand that you are?   
D.: Please tell me the way.   
M.: **Is it necessary to show the way in the interior of your own home?   
This is within you.**   
And here is another one   
D: "How to make the Quest, Who am I?   
M: " **The way is subjective, not objective; so it cannot and need not be  
shown by another**. Is it necessary to show anyone the way inside his own  
house? If the seeker keeps his mind still, that will be enough."   
Michael Langford however, gives atleast ten descriptions of his practice.

Dear snow,   
I agree with you. The problem with commentators is that they   
vitiate the essence of original message of the Master. For example,   
take Sri Sankara. He said Advaitam, the One without a second.   
But his followers were trying to out-do Sri Sankara. Subsequently,   
as one may see in Panchadasi and other works, there are two schools under Sri  
Sankara, the Bamati School and the Bhatta School. One says that one will have  
still the sports of Maya veiling him, till he attains videha kaivalyam, that  
is leaving the body in liberated state. The other school says Maya stops the  
sports, once you kill the ego, which is only Maya-swarupam. Both have a set  
of arguments to support their views. The whole essence of Advaitam is lost in  
this lingual diarrohea of commentators. If one attains   
advaitic siddhi, one should stop commenting. If you start addressing someone  
as different from you, you accept duality.   
Arunachala Siva.

Ongoing through the comments on Awareness Watching Awareness of Micheal  
Langford,doubts are expressed by members of this forum that awareness  
watching awareness cannot be the state of BEING.If the members go through  
the complete text of Mr.Langford, it will be clear that it is same as self  
enquiry.Mr. Micheal very clearly explains that Awareness watching awareness is  
nothing but turning our attention inwards.He has categorically mentioned that  
Awareness Watching awareness is Awareness Being Awareness   
He has clarified that because of long ancient habit of looking outwards  
towards people places and things,the word watching is used in practice  
instructions and that way we take the same habit of watching the people places  
and things and we shut our eyes and turn inwards.That is why the word watching  
is used.   
My question to devotees is that whether any of the member is able to turn his  
attention inwards without effort.As for i am concerned, I am not able to turn  
my attention inwards with out effort and the moment effort is lost,  
immediately mind turns outwards.The effort is put by Ego and not by Self and  
when ego comes in, then the thinker comes into play and so the duality.When a  
question was put to bhagavan on Choiceless Awareness(effortless awareness)  
advocated by JK(which is same as state of being), Bhagavan replied that it is  
same as Summa Iru and if one can attain that state then it is fine.However  
Bhagavan says that due to age old vasanas, a person cannot attain Choiceless  
awareness without effort and hence continuous effort is   
required.Tamil being an ancient language any ideas can be expressed very  
clearly without any distortion in Tamil.Bhagavan has composed most of his  
works in Tamil.Once it is translated in other language especially english, due  
to want of proper words, the meaning gets distorted even though the author  
may like to give exact meaning.Watching also falls in that category.

Dear Mr.Snow,   
With reference to your post as above, i reproduce below in italics from  
Mr.Langford's article from the web site <http://www.dosisnet.de/awa.pd>as wrt  
to duration of practice. _To change this long habit of looking outward you  
need to practice. Spend as many hours per day practicing as you can. If you  
only practice awareness watching awareness for 30 minutes per day and spend  
the other 23 and a half hours looking outward, you will not progress very  
quickly_   
From the above it is evident that Mr.Langford is inline with Bhagaan wrt  
duration of practice.

Yes, i have read that. But as Michael Langford says, "the Awareness Watching  
Awareness Method is always to be done with the eyes closed."   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or  
not like this: A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes   
it happens that when the eyes are closed the latent thoughts rush forth with  
great vigour. It may also be difficult to   
introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of mind to do so.  
The mind is contaminated when it takes in   
objects. Otherwise, it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind  
active in its own pursuit without taking in   
external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
And here is another quote: Question: Is it enough if I spend some time in the mornings and some time in  
the evenings for this atma-vichara? Or should I do it always, even when I am  
writing or walking?   
A: What is your real nature? Is it writing, walking or being? The one  
unalterable reality is being. Until you realize that state of pure being you  
should pursue the enquiry. If once you are established in it there will be no  
further worry.No one will enquire into the source of thoughts unless thoughts  
arise. So long as you think I am walking or I am writing, enquire who does  
it.

Friends,   
 If we do not get "dogmatic", I think Awareness Watching awareness is just Self Inquiry. I do not understand why we have a problem with this method.   
After all, what the author is saying is: 1\. "You are Awareness" [Awareness is Brahman - SAT CHIT ANANDA, All  
Scriptures say this]   
2\. "turn away from the objects and put all attention on awareness" [Drop all  
objects and meditate on Brahman alone].   
3. "Rest in awareness" [Let the "I" remain with its source]   
I do not see any problem with this teaching. How many amongst us are really  
convinced that "I am Awareness" ?   
Why are we not convinced, if we are not? Ramana said it, Scriptures say it !   
This person, I am not aware of his actual life style, is just saying turn away  
from all objects and remain as Self.   
When a thought comes "I am hurt", revert attention to that which is aware of  
this. Though the wordings may sound different this is EXACTLY SELF INQUIRY.   
Observing awareness is not Self inquiry. But detaching from everything and  
remaining as Awareness is Summa Iru - JUST BE. Only problem will be mind will  
not allow it, it moves out. So the practice is to bring it back to the  
Awareness.   
Sitting meditation or sitting with closed eyes will be useful intially. But  
eventually it has to be 24 hours, eyes open or closed.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Mr.Snow,   
 It is clear from the reply given by bhagavan that it is difficult to introvert the mind with eyes open. When you keep the eyes open, not only the thought of objects seen by eye comes up in mind and disturbs u,but also thought of past and future comes up in mind. if you close your eyes, only thoughts of past and future will haunt you..So it is better to keep eyes closed instead open so that you have only one distraction instead of two..May be that a very advanced sadhaka will be able to meditate with eyes open but I have not so far seen in meditation hall of Ramanasramam any serious and sincere sadhaka meditating with eyes open.For that matter majority of peoplemeditate with eyes closed.That is the reason Mr.Langford has suggested to close the eyes.Bhagavan himself has told that what is important is to turn our attention inwards and it does not matter whether the eye is open or closed during meditation.   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or  
not like this: A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted

Ashtavakra Gita says : Yadi deham prtak kritya, chitti vishramya tistasi   
adhunaiva sukam shantam, bandha mukto bhavishyasi   
if you detach yourself from "Body" [including mind], and remain resting in  
Awareness   
Very soon [immediately ?], you shall find Bliss, Peace and release from all  
bondage.   
Relax into Awareness and detach from all external objects mentally.   
This is sadhana... A Valid method in all.   
Many people may have objection to his classification of saints. Some times  
saying Ramesh balsekar's teachings are not correct and some times about  
Lucknow. I am not sure why he makes these comments but i have my own  
agreements and disagreements on these mundane aspects.   
The method however is perfect.   
That said, is it the fastest method? I am not sure. A Bhakta might benefit  
from Surrender. But Self inquiry is not different from the method he is  
teaching.

Dear everyone,   
If one can take Awareness Wathing Awarness is Being Awareness,   
all problems do get solved.   
In another paragraph of the article of Michael Langford, I believe   
that he had said that there are 10 methods. This again poses   
problem. There is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being  
still.   
I checked up Michael James who has worked with Sri Sadhu Om,   
and who has thoroughly learnt Tamizh. He says about the   
practice and number of hours: 1\. There is no fixed time. One can keep regularity of say half an hour or 1  
hour per day. This may be increased in course of time.   
2\. During other times, one should do either work for his livelihood   
or necessity but not turn the mind outwards towards unwanted things., like  
watching the road, watching other people, watching   
useless programmes in TV or reading worthless books etc.,   
3. Regarding closed eyes and open eyes, Bhagavan Ramana said to Annamalai Swami that closing the eyes, would keep the mind free, without using the senses, and so the mind will be more vigorous   
in thinking about various things. It is like throwing a ball on a wall, by  
standing closer to the wall, the ball would bounce back more vigorously since  
the distance to be covered would be less. Keeping the eyes open, can at least  
tell you that you mind is going outwards and seeing things that are worthless.  
The mind plus   
open eyes is better controlled than the mind plus shut eyes.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Summa iru, is not a method.   
when i am not summa iru. .. i will do inquiry, who is not just be state? That  
dissolves the "i" and i just AM.   
Dissolution of "I" can happen various ways. Listen to Arunachala Siva. That is  
Self inquiry too, coz the i dissolves leaving u summa iru.   
Self surrender through Love of God. .. Listening to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is  
also Self inquiry, coz it just dissolves the "I" and leaves one as Self.   
How many ways are there to fall asleep ? One would suggest have a pillow.  
Another would suggest have a good bed. Someone may say. .. just get tired!   
Get Tired with the world   
The method if "Awareness Watching Awareness" is Mind watching Siva. Like Nandi  
watching Siva. Turning away from the world and placing the mind on Awareness  
is indeed Self inquiry. Slowly mind merges in that Awareness. Coz it has  
nothing else. When my attention is on an object, the mind merges with that. ..  
when turned towards Self, its mind turned inwards.   
We all wrote on similar lines elsewhere. .. Please dont mind this, I feel : saying that this method is wrong appears to me to be the scholar problem. If  
you see a group of 10 scholars, they will not agree to each other. they might  
be talking the same thing, but still keep saying the other is wrong !!

This can also be viewed in the context of the following from

that I am' sums up the whole truth. THE METHOD IS SUMMARIZED IN 'BE STILL'.   
And what does stillness mean? It means 'destroy yourself', because, every  
name and form is the cause of trouble. 'I-I' is   
the Self. 'I am this' is the ego. When the 'I' is kept up as the   
'I' only, it is the Self. When it flies off at a tangent and says,   
'I am this or that', I am such and such', it is the ego.   
Verse 1217: Since becoming established in the state of the Self is both the  
means and the goal to be attained, remain still.   
Talks No. 322 is as under:-   
Question: What should one do in order to remain free from thoughts as advised  
by you? Is it only enquiry 'Who am I?'   
Bhagavan: Only to remain still. Do it and see.   
Question: It is impossible.   
Bhagavan: Exactly. For the same reason, the enquiry 'Who am I?' is advised.   
Verse 2328: The wonderful meaning of the supreme world [summa iru] is to know  
and rest in the Atma Swarupa through the enquriy   
'Who am I?'   
Verse 2114: Except by remaining still [summa iruttal] by what great tapas can  
the Atma Swarupam be attained in the Heart?   
Arunachala Siva.

I find there to be some contradictions between Sri Bhagavan's and Michael  
Langford's teachings. Michael Langford says that awareness watching awareness  
should be always done eyes shut, but Sri Bhagavan said that it is totally  
immaterial in Self-Enquiry and actually sometimes advised vichara to be done  
eyes open.   
Also, here is a dialogue with Sri Bhagavan and a questioner: D.: I do not understand what I should do.   
M: **If it is anything objective the way can be shown objectively. This   
is subjective.**   
D.: But I do not understand.   
M.: What! Do you not understand that you are?   
D.: Please tell me the way.   
M.: **Is it necessary to show the way in the interior of your own home?   
This is within you.**   
And here is another one   
D: "How to make the Quest, Who am I?   
M: " **The way is subjective, not objective; so it cannot and need not be  
shown by another**. Is it necessary to show anyone the way inside his own  
house? If the seeker keeps his mind still, that will be enough."   
Michael Langford however, gives atleast ten descriptions of his practice.

Dear snow,   
I agree with you. The problem with commentators is that they   
vitiate the essence of original message of the Master. For example,   
take Sri Sankara. He said Advaitam, the One without a second.   
But his followers were trying to out-do Sri Sankara. Subsequently,   
as one may see in Panchadasi and other works, there are two schools under Sri  
Sankara, the Bamati School and the Bhatta School. One says that one will have  
still the sports of Maya veiling him, till he attains videha kaivalyam, that  
is leaving the body in liberated state. The other school says Maya stops the  
sports, once you kill the ego, which is only Maya-swarupam. Both have a set  
of arguments to support their views. The whole essence of Advaitam is lost in  
this lingual diarrohea of commentators. If one attains   
advaitic siddhi, one should stop commenting. If you start addressing someone  
as different from you, you accept duality.   
Arunachala Siva.

Ongoing through the comments on Awareness Watching Awareness of Micheal  
Langford,doubts are expressed by members of this forum that awareness  
watching awareness cannot be the state of BEING.If the members go through  
the complete text of Mr.Langford, it will be clear that it is same as self  
enquiry.Mr. Micheal very clearly explains that Awareness watching awareness is  
nothing but turning our attention inwards.He has categorically mentioned that  
Awareness Watching awareness is Awareness Being Awareness   
He has clarified that because of long ancient habit of looking outwards  
towards people places and things,the word watching is used in practice  
instructions and that way we take the same habit of watching the people places  
and things and we shut our eyes and turn inwards.That is why the word watching  
is used.   
My question to devotees is that whether any of the member is able to turn his  
attention inwards without effort.As for i am concerned, I am not able to turn  
my attention inwards with out effort and the moment effort is lost,  
immediately mind turns outwards.The effort is put by Ego and not by Self and  
when ego comes in, then the thinker comes into play and so the duality.When a  
question was put to bhagavan on Choiceless Awareness(effortless awareness)  
advocated by JK(which is same as state of being), Bhagavan replied that it is  
same as Summa Iru and if one can attain that state then it is fine.However  
Bhagavan says that due to age old vasanas, a person cannot attain Choiceless  
awareness without effort and hence continuous effort is   
required.Tamil being an ancient language any ideas can be expressed very  
clearly without any distortion in Tamil.Bhagavan has composed most of his  
works in Tamil.Once it is translated in other language especially english, due  
to want of proper words, the meaning gets distorted even though the author  
may like to give exact meaning.Watching also falls in that category.

Dear Mr.Snow,   
With reference to your post as above, i reproduce below in italics from  
Mr.Langford's article from the web site <http://www.dosisnet.de/awa.pd>as wrt  
to duration of practice. _To change this long habit of looking outward you  
need to practice. Spend as many hours per day practicing as you can. If you  
only practice awareness watching awareness for 30 minutes per day and spend  
the other 23 and a half hours looking outward, you will not progress very  
quickly_   
From the above it is evident that Mr.Langford is inline with Bhagaan wrt  
duration of practice.

Yes, i have read that. But as Michael Langford says, "the Awareness Watching  
Awareness Method is always to be done with the eyes closed."   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or  
not like this: A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes   
it happens that when the eyes are closed the latent thoughts rush forth with  
great vigour. It may also be difficult to   
introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of mind to do so.  
The mind is contaminated when it takes in   
objects. Otherwise, it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind  
active in its own pursuit without taking in   
external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
And here is another quote: Question: Is it enough if I spend some time in the mornings and some time in  
the evenings for this atma-vichara? Or should I do it always, even when I am  
writing or walking?   
A: What is your real nature? Is it writing, walking or being? The one  
unalterable reality is being. Until you realize that state of pure being you  
should pursue the enquiry. If once you are established in it there will be no  
further worry.No one will enquire into the source of thoughts unless thoughts  
arise. So long as you think I am walking or I am writing, enquire who does  
it.

Friends,   
 If we do not get "dogmatic", I think Awareness Watching awareness is just Self Inquiry. I do not understand why we have a problem with this method.   
After all, what the author is saying is: 1\. "You are Awareness" [Awareness is Brahman - SAT CHIT ANANDA, All  
Scriptures say this]   
2\. "turn away from the objects and put all attention on awareness" [Drop all  
objects and meditate on Brahman alone].   
3. "Rest in awareness" [Let the "I" remain with its source]   
I do not see any problem with this teaching. How many amongst us are really  
convinced that "I am Awareness" ?   
Why are we not convinced, if we are not? Ramana said it, Scriptures say it !   
This person, I am not aware of his actual life style, is just saying turn away  
from all objects and remain as Self.   
When a thought comes "I am hurt", revert attention to that which is aware of  
this. Though the wordings may sound different this is EXACTLY SELF INQUIRY.   
Observing awareness is not Self inquiry. But detaching from everything and  
remaining as Awareness is Summa Iru - JUST BE. Only problem will be mind will  
not allow it, it moves out. So the practice is to bring it back to the  
Awareness.   
Sitting meditation or sitting with closed eyes will be useful intially. But  
eventually it has to be 24 hours, eyes open or closed.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Mr.Snow,   
 It is clear from the reply given by bhagavan that it is difficult to introvert the mind with eyes open. When you keep the eyes open, not only the thought of objects seen by eye comes up in mind and disturbs u,but also thought of past and future comes up in mind. if you close your eyes, only thoughts of past and future will haunt you..So it is better to keep eyes closed instead open so that you have only one distraction instead of two..May be that a very advanced sadhaka will be able to meditate with eyes open but I have not so far seen in meditation hall of Ramanasramam any serious and sincere sadhaka meditating with eyes open.For that matter majority of peoplemeditate with eyes closed.That is the reason Mr.Langford has suggested to close the eyes.Bhagavan himself has told that what is important is to turn our attention inwards and it does not matter whether the eye is open or closed during meditation.   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or  
not like this: A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted

Ashtavakra Gita says : Yadi deham prtak kritya, chitti vishramya tistasi   
adhunaiva sukam shantam, bandha mukto bhavishyasi   
if you detach yourself from "Body" [including mind], and remain resting in  
Awareness   
Very soon [immediately ?], you shall find Bliss, Peace and release from all  
bondage.   
Relax into Awareness and detach from all external objects mentally.   
This is sadhana... A Valid method in all.   
Many people may have objection to his classification of saints. Some times  
saying Ramesh balsekar's teachings are not correct and some times about  
Lucknow. I am not sure why he makes these comments but i have my own  
agreements and disagreements on these mundane aspects.   
The method however is perfect.   
That said, is it the fastest method? I am not sure. A Bhakta might benefit  
from Surrender. But Self inquiry is not different from the method he is  
teaching.

Dear everyone,   
If one can take Awareness Wathing Awarness is Being Awareness,   
all problems do get solved.   
In another paragraph of the article of Michael Langford, I believe   
that he had said that there are 10 methods. This again poses   
problem. There is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being  
still.   
I checked up Michael James who has worked with Sri Sadhu Om,   
and who has thoroughly learnt Tamizh. He says about the   
practice and number of hours: 1\. There is no fixed time. One can keep regularity of say half an hour or 1  
hour per day. This may be increased in course of time.   
2\. During other times, one should do either work for his livelihood   
or necessity but not turn the mind outwards towards unwanted things., like  
watching the road, watching other people, watching   
useless programmes in TV or reading worthless books etc.,   
3. Regarding closed eyes and open eyes, Bhagavan Ramana said to Annamalai Swami that closing the eyes, would keep the mind free, without using the senses, and so the mind will be more vigorous   
in thinking about various things. It is like throwing a ball on a wall, by  
standing closer to the wall, the ball would bounce back more vigorously since  
the distance to be covered would be less. Keeping the eyes open, can at least  
tell you that you mind is going outwards and seeing things that are worthless.  
The mind plus   
open eyes is better controlled than the mind plus shut eyes.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Summa iru, is not a method.   
when i am not summa iru. .. i will do inquiry, who is not just be state? That  
dissolves the "i" and i just AM.   
Dissolution of "I" can happen various ways. Listen to Arunachala Siva. That is  
Self inquiry too, coz the i dissolves leaving u summa iru.   
Self surrender through Love of God. .. Listening to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is  
also Self inquiry, coz it just dissolves the "I" and leaves one as Self.   
How many ways are there to fall asleep ? One would suggest have a pillow.  
Another would suggest have a good bed. Someone may say. .. just get tired!   
Get Tired with the world   
The method if "Awareness Watching Awareness" is Mind watching Siva. Like Nandi  
watching Siva. Turning away from the world and placing the mind on Awareness  
is indeed Self inquiry. Slowly mind merges in that Awareness. Coz it has  
nothing else. When my attention is on an object, the mind merges with that. ..  
when turned towards Self, its mind turned inwards.   
We all wrote on similar lines elsewhere. .. Please dont mind this, I feel : saying that this method is wrong appears to me to be the scholar problem. If  
you see a group of 10 scholars, they will not agree to each other. they might  
be talking the same thing, but still keep saying the other is wrong !!

Dear srkudai,   
Muruganar says in Padamalai Verse 2399: Through His gentle smile, radiant Padam joyfully declares: "Why   
this distress? Be happy by just REMAINING till".   
This can also be viewed in the context of the following from   
Maharshi's Gospel: Bhagavan: Your duty is to be, and not to be this or that. 'I am   
that I am' sums up the whole truth. THE METHOD IS SUMMARIZED IN 'BE STILL'.   
And what does stillness mean? It means 'destroy yourself', because, every  
name and form is the cause of trouble. 'I-I' is   
the Self. 'I am this' is the ego. When the 'I' is kept up as the   
'I' only, it is the Self. When it flies off at a tangent and says,   
'I am this or that', I am such and such', it is the ego.   
Verse 1217: Since becoming established in the state of the Self is both the  
means and the goal to be attained, remain still.   
Talks No. 322 is as under:-   
Question: What should one do in order to remain free from thoughts as advised  
by you? Is it only enquiry 'Who am I?'   
Bhagavan: Only to remain still. Do it and see.   
Question: It is impossible.   
Bhagavan: Exactly. For the same reason, the enquiry 'Who am I?' is advised.   
Verse 2328: The wonderful meaning of the supreme world [summa iru] is to know  
and rest in the Atma Swarupa through the enquriy   
'Who am I?'   
Verse 2114: Except by remaining still [summa iruttal] by what great tapas can  
the Atma Swarupam be attained in the Heart?   
Arunachala Siva.

I find there to be some contradictions between Sri Bhagavan's and Michael  
Langford's teachings. Michael Langford says that awareness watching awareness  
should be always done eyes shut, but Sri Bhagavan said that it is totally  
immaterial in Self-Enquiry and actually sometimes advised vichara to be done  
eyes open.   
Also, here is a dialogue with Sri Bhagavan and a questioner: D.: I do not understand what I should do.   
M: **If it is anything objective the way can be shown objectively. This   
is subjective.**   
D.: But I do not understand.   
M.: What! Do you not understand that you are?   
D.: Please tell me the way.   
M.: **Is it necessary to show the way in the interior of your own home?   
This is within you.**   
And here is another one   
D: "How to make the Quest, Who am I?   
M: " **The way is subjective, not objective; so it cannot and need not be  
shown by another**. Is it necessary to show anyone the way inside his own  
house? If the seeker keeps his mind still, that will be enough."   
Michael Langford however, gives atleast ten descriptions of his practice.

Dear snow,   
I agree with you. The problem with commentators is that they   
vitiate the essence of original message of the Master. For example,   
take Sri Sankara. He said Advaitam, the One without a second.   
But his followers were trying to out-do Sri Sankara. Subsequently,   
as one may see in Panchadasi and other works, there are two schools under Sri  
Sankara, the Bamati School and the Bhatta School. One says that one will have  
still the sports of Maya veiling him, till he attains videha kaivalyam, that  
is leaving the body in liberated state. The other school says Maya stops the  
sports, once you kill the ego, which is only Maya-swarupam. Both have a set  
of arguments to support their views. The whole essence of Advaitam is lost in  
this lingual diarrohea of commentators. If one attains   
advaitic siddhi, one should stop commenting. If you start addressing someone  
as different from you, you accept duality.   
Arunachala Siva.

Ongoing through the comments on Awareness Watching Awareness of Micheal  
Langford,doubts are expressed by members of this forum that awareness  
watching awareness cannot be the state of BEING.If the members go through  
the complete text of Mr.Langford, it will be clear that it is same as self  
enquiry.Mr. Micheal very clearly explains that Awareness watching awareness is  
nothing but turning our attention inwards.He has categorically mentioned that  
Awareness Watching awareness is Awareness Being Awareness   
He has clarified that because of long ancient habit of looking outwards  
towards people places and things,the word watching is used in practice  
instructions and that way we take the same habit of watching the people places  
and things and we shut our eyes and turn inwards.That is why the word watching  
is used.   
My question to devotees is that whether any of the member is able to turn his  
attention inwards without effort.As for i am concerned, I am not able to turn  
my attention inwards with out effort and the moment effort is lost,  
immediately mind turns outwards.The effort is put by Ego and not by Self and  
when ego comes in, then the thinker comes into play and so the duality.When a  
question was put to bhagavan on Choiceless Awareness(effortless awareness)  
advocated by JK(which is same as state of being), Bhagavan replied that it is  
same as Summa Iru and if one can attain that state then it is fine.However  
Bhagavan says that due to age old vasanas, a person cannot attain Choiceless  
awareness without effort and hence continuous effort is   
required.Tamil being an ancient language any ideas can be expressed very  
clearly without any distortion in Tamil.Bhagavan has composed most of his  
works in Tamil.Once it is translated in other language especially english, due  
to want of proper words, the meaning gets distorted even though the author  
may like to give exact meaning.Watching also falls in that category.

Dear Mr.Snow,   
With reference to your post as above, i reproduce below in italics from  
Mr.Langford's article from the web site <http://www.dosisnet.de/awa.pd>as wrt  
to duration of practice. _To change this long habit of looking outward you  
need to practice. Spend as many hours per day practicing as you can. If you  
only practice awareness watching awareness for 30 minutes per day and spend  
the other 23 and a half hours looking outward, you will not progress very  
quickly_   
From the above it is evident that Mr.Langford is inline with Bhagaan wrt  
duration of practice.

Yes, i have read that. But as Michael Langford says, "the Awareness Watching  
Awareness Method is always to be done with the eyes closed."   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or  
not like this: A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes   
it happens that when the eyes are closed the latent thoughts rush forth with  
great vigour. It may also be difficult to   
introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of mind to do so.  
The mind is contaminated when it takes in   
objects. Otherwise, it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind  
active in its own pursuit without taking in   
external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
And here is another quote: Question: Is it enough if I spend some time in the mornings and some time in  
the evenings for this atma-vichara? Or should I do it always, even when I am  
writing or walking?   
A: What is your real nature? Is it writing, walking or being? The one  
unalterable reality is being. Until you realize that state of pure being you  
should pursue the enquiry. If once you are established in it there will be no  
further worry.No one will enquire into the source of thoughts unless thoughts  
arise. So long as you think I am walking or I am writing, enquire who does  
it.

Friends,   
 If we do not get "dogmatic", I think Awareness Watching awareness is just Self Inquiry. I do not understand why we have a problem with this method.   
After all, what the author is saying is: 1\. "You are Awareness" [Awareness is Brahman - SAT CHIT ANANDA, All  
Scriptures say this]   
2\. "turn away from the objects and put all attention on awareness" [Drop all  
objects and meditate on Brahman alone].   
3. "Rest in awareness" [Let the "I" remain with its source]   
I do not see any problem with this teaching. How many amongst us are really  
convinced that "I am Awareness" ?   
Why are we not convinced, if we are not? Ramana said it, Scriptures say it !   
This person, I am not aware of his actual life style, is just saying turn away  
from all objects and remain as Self.   
When a thought comes "I am hurt", revert attention to that which is aware of  
this. Though the wordings may sound different this is EXACTLY SELF INQUIRY.   
Observing awareness is not Self inquiry. But detaching from everything and  
remaining as Awareness is Summa Iru - JUST BE. Only problem will be mind will  
not allow it, it moves out. So the practice is to bring it back to the  
Awareness.   
Sitting meditation or sitting with closed eyes will be useful intially. But  
eventually it has to be 24 hours, eyes open or closed.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Mr.Snow,   
 It is clear from the reply given by bhagavan that it is difficult to introvert the mind with eyes open. When you keep the eyes open, not only the thought of objects seen by eye comes up in mind and disturbs u,but also thought of past and future comes up in mind. if you close your eyes, only thoughts of past and future will haunt you..So it is better to keep eyes closed instead open so that you have only one distraction instead of two..May be that a very advanced sadhaka will be able to meditate with eyes open but I have not so far seen in meditation hall of Ramanasramam any serious and sincere sadhaka meditating with eyes open.For that matter majority of peoplemeditate with eyes closed.That is the reason Mr.Langford has suggested to close the eyes.Bhagavan himself has told that what is important is to turn our attention inwards and it does not matter whether the eye is open or closed during meditation.   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or

Ashtavakra Gita says : Yadi deham prtak kritya, chitti vishramya tistasi   
adhunaiva sukam shantam, bandha mukto bhavishyasi   
if you detach yourself from "Body" [including mind], and remain resting in  
Awareness   
Very soon [immediately ?], you shall find Bliss, Peace and release from all  
bondage.   
Relax into Awareness and detach from all external objects mentally.   
This is sadhana... A Valid method in all.   
Many people may have objection to his classification of saints. Some times  
saying Ramesh balsekar's teachings are not correct and some times about  
Lucknow. I am not sure why he makes these comments but i have my own  
agreements and disagreements on these mundane aspects.   
The method however is perfect.   
That said, is it the fastest method? I am not sure. A Bhakta might benefit  
from Surrender. But Self inquiry is not different from the method he is  
teaching.

Dear everyone,   
If one can take Awareness Wathing Awarness is Being Awareness,   
all problems do get solved.   
In another paragraph of the article of Michael Langford, I believe   
that he had said that there are 10 methods. This again poses   
problem. There is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being  
still.   
I checked up Michael James who has worked with Sri Sadhu Om,   
and who has thoroughly learnt Tamizh. He says about the   
practice and number of hours: 1\. There is no fixed time. One can keep regularity of say half an hour or 1  
hour per day. This may be increased in course of time.   
2\. During other times, one should do either work for his livelihood   
or necessity but not turn the mind outwards towards unwanted things., like  
watching the road, watching other people, watching   
useless programmes in TV or reading worthless books etc.,   
3. Regarding closed eyes and open eyes, Bhagavan Ramana said to Annamalai Swami that closing the eyes, would keep the mind free, without using the senses, and so the mind will be more vigorous   
in thinking about various things. It is like throwing a ball on a wall, by  
standing closer to the wall, the ball would bounce back more vigorously since  
the distance to be covered would be less. Keeping the eyes open, can at least  
tell you that you mind is going outwards and seeing things that are worthless.  
The mind plus   
open eyes is better controlled than the mind plus shut eyes.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Summa iru, is not a method.   
when i am not summa iru. .. i will do inquiry, who is not just be state? That  
dissolves the "i" and i just AM.   
Dissolution of "I" can happen various ways. Listen to Arunachala Siva. That is  
Self inquiry too, coz the i dissolves leaving u summa iru.   
Self surrender through Love of God. .. Listening to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is  
also Self inquiry, coz it just dissolves the "I" and leaves one as Self.   
How many ways are there to fall asleep ? One would suggest have a pillow.  
Another would suggest have a good bed. Someone may say. .. just get tired!   
Get Tired with the world   
The method if "Awareness Watching Awareness" is Mind watching Siva. Like Nandi  
watching Siva. Turning away from the world and placing the mind on Awareness  
is indeed Self inquiry. Slowly mind merges in that Awareness. Coz it has  
nothing else. When my attention is on an object, the mind merges with that. ..  
when turned towards Self, its mind turned inwards.   
We all wrote on similar lines elsewhere. .. Please dont mind this, I feel : saying that this method is wrong appears to me to be the scholar problem. If  
you see a group of 10 scholars, they will not agree to each other. they might  
be talking the same thing, but still keep saying the other is wrong !!

Dear srkudai,   
Muruganar says in Padamalai Verse 2399: Through His gentle smile, radiant Padam joyfully declares: "Why   
this distress? Be happy by just REMAINING till".   
This can also be viewed in the context of the following from   
Maharshi's Gospel: Bhagavan: Your duty is to be, and not to be this or that. 'I am   
that I am' sums up the whole truth. THE METHOD IS SUMMARIZED IN 'BE STILL'.   
And what does stillness mean? It means 'destroy yourself', because, every  
name and form is the cause of trouble. 'I-I' is   
the Self. 'I am this' is the ego. When the 'I' is kept up as the   
'I' only, it is the Self. When it flies off at a tangent and says,   
'I am this or that', I am such and such', it is the ego.   
Verse 1217: Since becoming established in the state of the Self is both the  
means and the goal to be attained, remain still.   
Talks No. 322 is as under:-   
Question: What should one do in order to remain free from thoughts as advised  
by you? Is it only enquiry 'Who am I?'   
Bhagavan: Only to remain still. Do it and see.   
Question: It is impossible.   
Bhagavan: Exactly. For the same reason, the enquiry 'Who am I?' is advised.   
Verse 2328: The wonderful meaning of the supreme world [summa iru] is to know  
and rest in the Atma Swarupa through the enquriy   
'Who am I?'   
Verse 2114: Except by remaining still [summa iruttal] by what great tapas can  
the Atma Swarupam be attained in the Heart?   
Arunachala Siva.

I find there to be some contradictions between Sri Bhagavan's and Michael  
Langford's teachings. Michael Langford says that awareness watching awareness  
should be always done eyes shut, but Sri Bhagavan said that it is totally  
immaterial in Self-Enquiry and actually sometimes advised vichara to be done  
eyes open.   
Also, here is a dialogue with Sri Bhagavan and a questioner: D.: I do not understand what I should do.   
M: **If it is anything objective the way can be shown objectively. This   
is subjective.**   
D.: But I do not understand.   
M.: What! Do you not understand that you are?   
D.: Please tell me the way.   
M.: **Is it necessary to show the way in the interior of your own home?   
This is within you.**   
And here is another one   
D: "How to make the Quest, Who am I?   
M: " **The way is subjective, not objective; so it cannot and need not be  
shown by another**. Is it necessary to show anyone the way inside his own  
house? If the seeker keeps his mind still, that will be enough."   
Michael Langford however, gives atleast ten descriptions of his practice.

Dear snow,   
I agree with you. The problem with commentators is that they   
vitiate the essence of original message of the Master. For example,   
take Sri Sankara. He said Advaitam, the One without a second.   
But his followers were trying to out-do Sri Sankara. Subsequently,   
as one may see in Panchadasi and other works, there are two schools under Sri  
Sankara, the Bamati School and the Bhatta School. One says that one will have  
still the sports of Maya veiling him, till he attains videha kaivalyam, that  
is leaving the body in liberated state. The other school says Maya stops the  
sports, once you kill the ego, which is only Maya-swarupam. Both have a set  
of arguments to support their views. The whole essence of Advaitam is lost in  
this lingual diarrohea of commentators. If one attains   
advaitic siddhi, one should stop commenting. If you start addressing someone  
as different from you, you accept duality.   
Arunachala Siva.

Ongoing through the comments on Awareness Watching Awareness of Micheal  
Langford,doubts are expressed by members of this forum that awareness  
watching awareness cannot be the state of BEING.If the members go through  
the complete text of Mr.Langford, it will be clear that it is same as self  
enquiry.Mr. Micheal very clearly explains that Awareness watching awareness is  
nothing but turning our attention inwards.He has categorically mentioned that  
Awareness Watching awareness is Awareness Being Awareness   
He has clarified that because of long ancient habit of looking outwards  
towards people places and things,the word watching is used in practice  
instructions and that way we take the same habit of watching the people places  
and things and we shut our eyes and turn inwards.That is why the word watching  
is used.   
My question to devotees is that whether any of the member is able to turn his  
attention inwards without effort.As for i am concerned, I am not able to turn  
my attention inwards with out effort and the moment effort is lost,  
immediately mind turns outwards.The effort is put by Ego and not by Self and  
when ego comes in, then the thinker comes into play and so the duality.When a  
question was put to bhagavan on Choiceless Awareness(effortless awareness)  
advocated by JK(which is same as state of being), Bhagavan replied that it is  
same as Summa Iru and if one can attain that state then it is fine.However  
Bhagavan says that due to age old vasanas, a person cannot attain Choiceless  
awareness without effort and hence continuous effort is   
required.Tamil being an ancient language any ideas can be expressed very  
clearly without any distortion in Tamil.Bhagavan has composed most of his  
works in Tamil.Once it is translated in other language especially english, due  
to want of proper words, the meaning gets distorted even though the author  
may like to give exact meaning.Watching also falls in that category.

Dear Mr.Snow,   
With reference to your post as above, i reproduce below in italics from  
Mr.Langford's article from the web site <http://www.dosisnet.de/awa.pd>as wrt  
to duration of practice. _To change this long habit of looking outward you  
need to practice. Spend as many hours per day practicing as you can. If you  
only practice awareness watching awareness for 30 minutes per day and spend  
the other 23 and a half hours looking outward, you will not progress very  
quickly_   
From the above it is evident that Mr.Langford is inline with Bhagaan wrt  
duration of practice.

Yes, i have read that. But as Michael Langford says, "the Awareness Watching  
Awareness Method is always to be done with the eyes closed."   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or  
not like this: A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes   
it happens that when the eyes are closed the latent thoughts rush forth with  
great vigour. It may also be difficult to   
introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of mind to do so.  
The mind is contaminated when it takes in   
objects. Otherwise, it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind  
active in its own pursuit without taking in   
external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
And here is another quote: Question: Is it enough if I spend some time in the mornings and some time in  
the evenings for this atma-vichara? Or should I do it always, even when I am  
writing or walking?   
A: What is your real nature? Is it writing, walking or being? The one  
unalterable reality is being. Until you realize that state of pure being you  
should pursue the enquiry. If once you are established in it there will be no  
further worry.No one will enquire into the source of thoughts unless thoughts  
arise. So long as you think I am walking or I am writing, enquire who does  
it.

Friends,   
 If we do not get "dogmatic", I think Awareness Watching awareness is just Self Inquiry. I do not understand why we have a problem with this method.   
After all, what the author is saying is: 1\. "You are Awareness" [Awareness is Brahman - SAT CHIT ANANDA, All  
Scriptures say this]   
2\. "turn away from the objects and put all attention on awareness" [Drop all  
objects and meditate on Brahman alone].   
3. "Rest in awareness" [Let the "I" remain with its source]   
I do not see any problem with this teaching. How many amongst us are really  
convinced that "I am Awareness" ?   
Why are we not convinced, if we are not? Ramana said it, Scriptures say it !   
This person, I am not aware of his actual life style, is just saying turn away  
from all objects and remain as Self.   
When a thought comes "I am hurt", revert attention to that which is aware of  
this. Though the wordings may sound different this is EXACTLY SELF INQUIRY.   
Observing awareness is not Self inquiry. But detaching from everything and  
remaining as Awareness is Summa Iru - JUST BE. Only problem will be mind will  
not allow it, it moves out. So the practice is to bring it back to the  
Awareness.   
Sitting meditation or sitting with closed eyes will be useful intially. But  
eventually it has to be 24 hours, eyes open or closed.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Mr.Snow,   
 It is clear from the reply given by bhagavan that it is difficult to introvert the mind with eyes open. When you keep the eyes open, not only the thought of objects seen by eye comes up in mind and disturbs u,but also thought of past and future comes up in mind. if you close your eyes, only thoughts of past and future will haunt you..So it is better to keep eyes closed instead open so that you have only one distraction instead of two..May be that a very advanced sadhaka will be able to meditate with eyes open but I have not so far seen in meditation hall of Ramanasramam any serious and sincere sadhaka meditating with eyes open.For that matter majority of peoplemeditate with eyes closed.That is the reason Mr.Langford has suggested to close the eyes.Bhagavan himself has told that what is important is to turn our attention inwards and it does not matter whether the eye is open or closed during meditation.   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or  
not like this: A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes

Ashtavakra Gita says : Yadi deham prtak kritya, chitti vishramya tistasi   
adhunaiva sukam shantam, bandha mukto bhavishyasi   
if you detach yourself from "Body" [including mind], and remain resting in  
Awareness   
Very soon [immediately ?], you shall find Bliss, Peace and release from all  
bondage.   
Relax into Awareness and detach from all external objects mentally.   
This is sadhana... A Valid method in all.   
Many people may have objection to his classification of saints. Some times  
saying Ramesh balsekar's teachings are not correct and some times about  
Lucknow. I am not sure why he makes these comments but i have my own  
agreements and disagreements on these mundane aspects.   
The method however is perfect.   
That said, is it the fastest method? I am not sure. A Bhakta might benefit  
from Surrender. But Self inquiry is not different from the method he is  
teaching.

Dear everyone,   
If one can take Awareness Wathing Awarness is Being Awareness,   
all problems do get solved.   
In another paragraph of the article of Michael Langford, I believe   
that he had said that there are 10 methods. This again poses   
problem. There is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being  
still.   
I checked up Michael James who has worked with Sri Sadhu Om,   
and who has thoroughly learnt Tamizh. He says about the   
practice and number of hours: 1\. There is no fixed time. One can keep regularity of say half an hour or 1  
hour per day. This may be increased in course of time.   
2\. During other times, one should do either work for his livelihood   
or necessity but not turn the mind outwards towards unwanted things., like  
watching the road, watching other people, watching   
useless programmes in TV or reading worthless books etc.,   
3. Regarding closed eyes and open eyes, Bhagavan Ramana said to Annamalai Swami that closing the eyes, would keep the mind free, without using the senses, and so the mind will be more vigorous   
in thinking about various things. It is like throwing a ball on a wall, by  
standing closer to the wall, the ball would bounce back more vigorously since  
the distance to be covered would be less. Keeping the eyes open, can at least  
tell you that you mind is going outwards and seeing things that are worthless.  
The mind plus   
open eyes is better controlled than the mind plus shut eyes.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Summa iru, is not a method.   
when i am not summa iru. .. i will do inquiry, who is not just be state? That  
dissolves the "i" and i just AM.   
Dissolution of "I" can happen various ways. Listen to Arunachala Siva. That is  
Self inquiry too, coz the i dissolves leaving u summa iru.   
Self surrender through Love of God. .. Listening to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is  
also Self inquiry, coz it just dissolves the "I" and leaves one as Self.   
How many ways are there to fall asleep ? One would suggest have a pillow.  
Another would suggest have a good bed. Someone may say. .. just get tired!   
Get Tired with the world   
The method if "Awareness Watching Awareness" is Mind watching Siva. Like Nandi  
watching Siva. Turning away from the world and placing the mind on Awareness  
is indeed Self inquiry. Slowly mind merges in that Awareness. Coz it has  
nothing else. When my attention is on an object, the mind merges with that. ..  
when turned towards Self, its mind turned inwards.   
We all wrote on similar lines elsewhere. .. Please dont mind this, I feel : saying that this method is wrong appears to me to be the scholar problem. If  
you see a group of 10 scholars, they will not agree to each other. they might  
be talking the same thing, but still keep saying the other is wrong !!

Dear srkudai,   
Muruganar says in Padamalai Verse 2399: Through His gentle smile, radiant Padam joyfully declares: "Why   
this distress? Be happy by just REMAINING till".   
This can also be viewed in the context of the following from   
Maharshi's Gospel: Bhagavan: Your duty is to be, and not to be this or that. 'I am   
that I am' sums up the whole truth. THE METHOD IS SUMMARIZED IN 'BE STILL'.   
And what does stillness mean? It means 'destroy yourself', because, every  
name and form is the cause of trouble. 'I-I' is   
the Self. 'I am this' is the ego. When the 'I' is kept up as the   
'I' only, it is the Self. When it flies off at a tangent and says,   
'I am this or that', I am such and such', it is the ego.   
Verse 1217: Since becoming established in the state of the Self is both the  
means and the goal to be attained, remain still.   
Talks No. 322 is as under:-   
Question: What should one do in order to remain free from thoughts as advised  
by you? Is it only enquiry 'Who am I?'   
Bhagavan: Only to remain still. Do it and see.   
Question: It is impossible.   
Bhagavan: Exactly. For the same reason, the enquiry 'Who am I?' is advised.   
Verse 2328: The wonderful meaning of the supreme world [summa iru] is to know  
and rest in the Atma Swarupa through the enquriy   
'Who am I?'   
Verse 2114: Except by remaining still [summa iruttal] by what great tapas can  
the Atma Swarupam be attained in the Heart?   
Arunachala Siva.

I find there to be some contradictions between Sri Bhagavan's and Michael  
Langford's teachings. Michael Langford says that awareness watching awareness  
should be always done eyes shut, but Sri Bhagavan said that it is totally  
immaterial in Self-Enquiry and actually sometimes advised vichara to be done  
eyes open.   
Also, here is a dialogue with Sri Bhagavan and a questioner: D.: I do not understand what I should do.   
M: **If it is anything objective the way can be shown objectively. This   
is subjective.**   
D.: But I do not understand.   
M.: What! Do you not understand that you are?   
D.: Please tell me the way.   
M.: **Is it necessary to show the way in the interior of your own home?   
This is within you.**   
And here is another one   
D: "How to make the Quest, Who am I?   
M: " **The way is subjective, not objective; so it cannot and need not be  
shown by another**. Is it necessary to show anyone the way inside his own  
house? If the seeker keeps his mind still, that will be enough."   
Michael Langford however, gives atleast ten descriptions of his practice.

Dear snow,   
I agree with you. The problem with commentators is that they   
vitiate the essence of original message of the Master. For example,   
take Sri Sankara. He said Advaitam, the One without a second.   
But his followers were trying to out-do Sri Sankara. Subsequently,   
as one may see in Panchadasi and other works, there are two schools under Sri  
Sankara, the Bamati School and the Bhatta School. One says that one will have  
still the sports of Maya veiling him, till he attains videha kaivalyam, that  
is leaving the body in liberated state. The other school says Maya stops the  
sports, once you kill the ego, which is only Maya-swarupam. Both have a set  
of arguments to support their views. The whole essence of Advaitam is lost in  
this lingual diarrohea of commentators. If one attains   
advaitic siddhi, one should stop commenting. If you start addressing someone  
as different from you, you accept duality.   
Arunachala Siva.

Ongoing through the comments on Awareness Watching Awareness of Micheal  
Langford,doubts are expressed by members of this forum that awareness  
watching awareness cannot be the state of BEING.If the members go through  
the complete text of Mr.Langford, it will be clear that it is same as self  
enquiry.Mr. Micheal very clearly explains that Awareness watching awareness is  
nothing but turning our attention inwards.He has categorically mentioned that  
Awareness Watching awareness is Awareness Being Awareness   
He has clarified that because of long ancient habit of looking outwards  
towards people places and things,the word watching is used in practice  
instructions and that way we take the same habit of watching the people places  
and things and we shut our eyes and turn inwards.That is why the word watching  
is used.   
My question to devotees is that whether any of the member is able to turn his  
attention inwards without effort.As for i am concerned, I am not able to turn  
my attention inwards with out effort and the moment effort is lost,  
immediately mind turns outwards.The effort is put by Ego and not by Self and  
when ego comes in, then the thinker comes into play and so the duality.When a  
question was put to bhagavan on Choiceless Awareness(effortless awareness)  
advocated by JK(which is same as state of being), Bhagavan replied that it is  
same as Summa Iru and if one can attain that state then it is fine.However  
Bhagavan says that due to age old vasanas, a person cannot attain Choiceless  
awareness without effort and hence continuous effort is   
required.Tamil being an ancient language any ideas can be expressed very  
clearly without any distortion in Tamil.Bhagavan has composed most of his  
works in Tamil.Once it is translated in other language especially english, due  
to want of proper words, the meaning gets distorted even though the author  
may like to give exact meaning.Watching also falls in that category.

Also, 'AWA-method' seems to be a practice that is done on certain hours, but  
Bhagavan said that vichara should be done throughout the entire waking state.

Dear Mr.Snow,   
With reference to your post as above, i reproduce below in italics from  
Mr.Langford's article from the web site <http://www.dosisnet.de/awa.pd>as wrt  
to duration of practice. _To change this long habit of looking outward you  
need to practice. Spend as many hours per day practicing as you can. If you  
only practice awareness watching awareness for 30 minutes per day and spend  
the other 23 and a half hours looking outward, you will not progress very  
quickly_   
From the above it is evident that Mr.Langford is inline with Bhagaan wrt  
duration of practice.

Yes, i have read that. But as Michael Langford says, "the Awareness Watching  
Awareness Method is always to be done with the eyes closed."   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or  
not like this: A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes   
it happens that when the eyes are closed the latent thoughts rush forth with  
great vigour. It may also be difficult to   
introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of mind to do so.  
The mind is contaminated when it takes in   
objects. Otherwise, it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind  
active in its own pursuit without taking in   
external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
And here is another quote: Question: Is it enough if I spend some time in the mornings and some time in  
the evenings for this atma-vichara? Or should I do it always, even when I am  
writing or walking?   
A: What is your real nature? Is it writing, walking or being? The one  
unalterable reality is being. Until you realize that state of pure being you  
should pursue the enquiry. If once you are established in it there will be no  
further worry.No one will enquire into the source of thoughts unless thoughts  
arise. So long as you think I am walking or I am writing, enquire who does  
it.

Friends,   
 If we do not get "dogmatic", I think Awareness Watching awareness is just Self Inquiry. I do not understand why we have a problem with this method.   
After all, what the author is saying is: 1\. "You are Awareness" [Awareness is Brahman - SAT CHIT ANANDA, All  
Scriptures say this]   
2\. "turn away from the objects and put all attention on awareness" [Drop all  
objects and meditate on Brahman alone].   
3. "Rest in awareness" [Let the "I" remain with its source]   
I do not see any problem with this teaching. How many amongst us are really  
convinced that "I am Awareness" ?   
Why are we not convinced, if we are not? Ramana said it, Scriptures say it !   
This person, I am not aware of his actual life style, is just saying turn away  
from all objects and remain as Self.   
When a thought comes "I am hurt", revert attention to that which is aware of  
this. Though the wordings may sound different this is EXACTLY SELF INQUIRY.   
Observing awareness is not Self inquiry. But detaching from everything and  
remaining as Awareness is Summa Iru - JUST BE. Only problem will be mind will  
not allow it, it moves out. So the practice is to bring it back to the  
Awareness.   
Sitting meditation or sitting with closed eyes will be useful intially. But  
eventually it has to be 24 hours, eyes open or closed.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Mr.Snow,   
 It is clear from the reply given by bhagavan that it is difficult to introvert the mind with eyes open. When you keep the eyes open, not only the thought of objects seen by eye comes up in mind and disturbs u,but also thought of past and future comes up in mind. if you close your eyes, only thoughts of past and future will haunt you..So it is better to keep eyes closed instead open so that you have only one distraction instead of two..May be that a very advanced sadhaka will be able to meditate with eyes open but I have not so far seen in meditation hall of Ramanasramam any serious and sincere sadhaka meditating with eyes open.For that matter majority of peoplemeditate with eyes closed.That is the reason Mr.Langford has suggested to close the eyes.Bhagavan himself has told that what is important is to turn our attention inwards and it does not matter whether the eye is open or closed during meditation.   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or

Ashtavakra Gita says : Yadi deham prtak kritya, chitti vishramya tistasi   
adhunaiva sukam shantam, bandha mukto bhavishyasi   
if you detach yourself from "Body" [including mind], and remain resting in  
Awareness   
Very soon [immediately ?], you shall find Bliss, Peace and release from all  
bondage.   
Relax into Awareness and detach from all external objects mentally.   
This is sadhana... A Valid method in all.   
Many people may have objection to his classification of saints. Some times  
saying Ramesh balsekar's teachings are not correct and some times about  
Lucknow. I am not sure why he makes these comments but i have my own  
agreements and disagreements on these mundane aspects.   
The method however is perfect.   
That said, is it the fastest method? I am not sure. A Bhakta might benefit  
from Surrender. But Self inquiry is not different from the method he is  
teaching.

Dear everyone,   
If one can take Awareness Wathing Awarness is Being Awareness,   
all problems do get solved.   
In another paragraph of the article of Michael Langford, I believe   
that he had said that there are 10 methods. This again poses   
problem. There is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being  
still.   
I checked up Michael James who has worked with Sri Sadhu Om,   
and who has thoroughly learnt Tamizh. He says about the   
practice and number of hours: 1\. There is no fixed time. One can keep regularity of say half an hour or 1  
hour per day. This may be increased in course of time.   
2\. During other times, one should do either work for his livelihood   
or necessity but not turn the mind outwards towards unwanted things., like  
watching the road, watching other people, watching   
useless programmes in TV or reading worthless books etc.,   
3. Regarding closed eyes and open eyes, Bhagavan Ramana said to Annamalai Swami that closing the eyes, would keep the mind free, without using the senses, and so the mind will be more vigorous   
in thinking about various things. It is like throwing a ball on a wall, by  
standing closer to the wall, the ball would bounce back more vigorously since  
the distance to be covered would be less. Keeping the eyes open, can at least  
tell you that you mind is going outwards and seeing things that are worthless.  
The mind plus   
open eyes is better controlled than the mind plus shut eyes.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Summa iru, is not a method.   
when i am not summa iru. .. i will do inquiry, who is not just be state? That  
dissolves the "i" and i just AM.   
Dissolution of "I" can happen various ways. Listen to Arunachala Siva. That is  
Self inquiry too, coz the i dissolves leaving u summa iru.   
Self surrender through Love of God. .. Listening to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is  
also Self inquiry, coz it just dissolves the "I" and leaves one as Self.   
How many ways are there to fall asleep ? One would suggest have a pillow.  
Another would suggest have a good bed. Someone may say. .. just get tired!   
Get Tired with the world   
The method if "Awareness Watching Awareness" is Mind watching Siva. Like Nandi  
watching Siva. Turning away from the world and placing the mind on Awareness  
is indeed Self inquiry. Slowly mind merges in that Awareness. Coz it has  
nothing else. When my attention is on an object, the mind merges with that. ..  
when turned towards Self, its mind turned inwards.   
We all wrote on similar lines elsewhere. .. Please dont mind this, I feel : saying that this method is wrong appears to me to be the scholar problem. If  
you see a group of 10 scholars, they will not agree to each other. they might  
be talking the same thing, but still keep saying the other is wrong !!   
Love!

Dear srkudai,   
Muruganar says in Padamalai Verse 2399: Through His gentle smile, radiant Padam joyfully declares: "Why   
this distress? Be happy by just REMAINING till".   
This can also be viewed in the context of the following from   
Maharshi's Gospel: Bhagavan: Your duty is to be, and not to be this or that. 'I am   
that I am' sums up the whole truth. THE METHOD IS SUMMARIZED IN 'BE STILL'.   
And what does stillness mean? It means 'destroy yourself', because, every  
name and form is the cause of trouble. 'I-I' is   
the Self. 'I am this' is the ego. When the 'I' is kept up as the   
'I' only, it is the Self. When it flies off at a tangent and says,   
'I am this or that', I am such and such', it is the ego.   
Verse 1217: Since becoming established in the state of the Self is both the  
means and the goal to be attained, remain still.   
Talks No. 322 is as under:-   
Question: What should one do in order to remain free from thoughts as advised  
by you? Is it only enquiry 'Who am I?'   
Bhagavan: Only to remain still. Do it and see.   
Question: It is impossible.   
Bhagavan: Exactly. For the same reason, the enquiry 'Who am I?' is advised.   
Verse 2328: The wonderful meaning of the supreme world [summa iru] is to know  
and rest in the Atma Swarupa through the enquriy   
'Who am I?'   
Verse 2114: Except by remaining still [summa iruttal] by what great tapas can  
the Atma Swarupam be attained in the Heart?   
Arunachala Siva.

I find there to be some contradictions between Sri Bhagavan's and Michael  
Langford's teachings. Michael Langford says that awareness watching awareness  
should be always done eyes shut, but Sri Bhagavan said that it is totally  
immaterial in Self-Enquiry and actually sometimes advised vichara to be done  
eyes open.   
Also, here is a dialogue with Sri Bhagavan and a questioner: D.: I do not understand what I should do.   
M: **If it is anything objective the way can be shown objectively. This   
is subjective.**   
D.: But I do not understand.   
M.: What! Do you not understand that you are?   
D.: Please tell me the way.   
M.: **Is it necessary to show the way in the interior of your own home?   
This is within you.**   
And here is another one   
D: "How to make the Quest, Who am I?   
M: " **The way is subjective, not objective; so it cannot and need not be  
shown by another**. Is it necessary to show anyone the way inside his own  
house? If the seeker keeps his mind still, that will be enough."   
Michael Langford however, gives atleast ten descriptions of his practice.

Dear snow,   
I agree with you. The problem with commentators is that they   
vitiate the essence of original message of the Master. For example,   
take Sri Sankara. He said Advaitam, the One without a second.   
But his followers were trying to out-do Sri Sankara. Subsequently,   
as one may see in Panchadasi and other works, there are two schools under Sri  
Sankara, the Bamati School and the Bhatta School. One says that one will have  
still the sports of Maya veiling him, till he attains videha kaivalyam, that  
is leaving the body in liberated state. The other school says Maya stops the  
sports, once you kill the ego, which is only Maya-swarupam. Both have a set  
of arguments to support their views. The whole essence of Advaitam is lost in  
this lingual diarrohea of commentators. If one attains   
advaitic siddhi, one should stop commenting. If you start addressing someone  
as different from you, you accept duality.   
Arunachala Siva.

Ongoing through the comments on Awareness Watching Awareness of Micheal  
Langford,doubts are expressed by members of this forum that awareness  
watching awareness cannot be the state of BEING.If the members go through  
the complete text of Mr.Langford, it will be clear that it is same as self  
enquiry.Mr. Micheal very clearly explains that Awareness watching awareness is  
nothing but turning our attention inwards.He has categorically mentioned that  
Awareness Watching awareness is Awareness Being Awareness   
He has clarified that because of long ancient habit of looking outwards  
towards people places and things,the word watching is used in practice  
instructions and that way we take the same habit of watching the people places  
and things and we shut our eyes and turn inwards.That is why the word watching  
is used.   
My question to devotees is that whether any of the member is able to turn his  
attention inwards without effort.As for i am concerned, I am not able to turn  
my attention inwards with out effort and the moment effort is lost,  
immediately mind turns outwards.The effort is put by Ego and not by Self and  
when ego comes in, then the thinker comes into play and so the duality.When a  
question was put to bhagavan on Choiceless Awareness(effortless awareness)  
advocated by JK(which is same as state of being), Bhagavan replied that it is  
same as Summa Iru and if one can attain that state then it is fine.However  
Bhagavan says that due to age old vasanas, a person cannot attain Choiceless  
awareness without effort and hence continuous effort is   
required.Tamil being an ancient language any ideas can be expressed very  
clearly without any distortion in Tamil.Bhagavan has composed most of his  
works in Tamil.Once it is translated in other language especially english, due  
to want of proper words, the meaning gets distorted even though the author  
may like to give exact meaning.Watching also falls in that category.

Also, 'AWA-method' seems to be a practice that is done on certain hours, but  
Bhagavan said that vichara should be done throughout the entire waking state.

Dear Mr.Snow,   
With reference to your post as above, i reproduce below in italics from  
Mr.Langford's article from the web site <http://www.dosisnet.de/awa.pd>as wrt  
to duration of practice. _To change this long habit of looking outward you  
need to practice. Spend as many hours per day practicing as you can. If you  
only practice awareness watching awareness for 30 minutes per day and spend  
the other 23 and a half hours looking outward, you will not progress very  
quickly_   
From the above it is evident that Mr.Langford is inline with Bhagaan wrt  
duration of practice.

Yes, i have read that. But as Michael Langford says, "the Awareness Watching  
Awareness Method is always to be done with the eyes closed."   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or  
not like this: A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes   
it happens that when the eyes are closed the latent thoughts rush forth with  
great vigour. It may also be difficult to   
introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of mind to do so.  
The mind is contaminated when it takes in   
objects. Otherwise, it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind  
active in its own pursuit without taking in   
external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
And here is another quote: Question: Is it enough if I spend some time in the mornings and some time in  
the evenings for this atma-vichara? Or should I do it always, even when I am  
writing or walking?   
A: What is your real nature? Is it writing, walking or being? The one  
unalterable reality is being. Until you realize that state of pure being you  
should pursue the enquiry. If once you are established in it there will be no  
further worry.No one will enquire into the source of thoughts unless thoughts  
arise. So long as you think I am walking or I am writing, enquire who does  
it.

Friends,   
 If we do not get "dogmatic", I think Awareness Watching awareness is just Self Inquiry. I do not understand why we have a problem with this method.   
After all, what the author is saying is: 1\. "You are Awareness" [Awareness is Brahman - SAT CHIT ANANDA, All  
Scriptures say this]   
2\. "turn away from the objects and put all attention on awareness" [Drop all  
objects and meditate on Brahman alone].   
3. "Rest in awareness" [Let the "I" remain with its source]   
I do not see any problem with this teaching. How many amongst us are really  
convinced that "I am Awareness" ?   
Why are we not convinced, if we are not? Ramana said it, Scriptures say it !   
This person, I am not aware of his actual life style, is just saying turn away  
from all objects and remain as Self.   
When a thought comes "I am hurt", revert attention to that which is aware of  
this. Though the wordings may sound different this is EXACTLY SELF INQUIRY.   
Observing awareness is not Self inquiry. But detaching from everything and  
remaining as Awareness is Summa Iru - JUST BE. Only problem will be mind will  
not allow it, it moves out. So the practice is to bring it back to the  
Awareness.   
Sitting meditation or sitting with closed eyes will be useful intially. But  
eventually it has to be 24 hours, eyes open or closed.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Mr.Snow,   
 It is clear from the reply given by bhagavan that it is difficult to introvert the mind with eyes open. When you keep the eyes open, not only the thought of objects seen by eye comes up in mind and disturbs u,but also thought of past and future comes up in mind. if you close your eyes, only thoughts of past and future will haunt you..So it is better to keep eyes closed instead open so that you have only one distraction instead of two..May be that a very advanced sadhaka will be able to meditate with eyes open but I have not so far seen in meditation hall of Ramanasramam any serious and sincere sadhaka meditating with eyes open.For that matter majority of peoplemeditate with eyes closed.That is the reason Mr.Langford has suggested to close the eyes.Bhagavan himself has told that what is important is to turn our attention inwards and it does not matter whether the eye is open or closed during meditation.   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or

Ashtavakra Gita says : Yadi deham prtak kritya, chitti vishramya tistasi   
adhunaiva sukam shantam, bandha mukto bhavishyasi   
if you detach yourself from "Body" [including mind], and remain resting in  
Awareness   
Very soon [immediately ?], you shall find Bliss, Peace and release from all  
bondage.   
Relax into Awareness and detach from all external objects mentally.   
This is sadhana... A Valid method in all.   
Many people may have objection to his classification of saints. Some times  
saying Ramesh balsekar's teachings are not correct and some times about  
Lucknow. I am not sure why he makes these comments but i have my own  
agreements and disagreements on these mundane aspects.   
The method however is perfect.   
That said, is it the fastest method? I am not sure. A Bhakta might benefit  
from Surrender. But Self inquiry is not different from the method he is  
teaching.

Dear everyone,   
If one can take Awareness Wathing Awarness is Being Awareness,   
all problems do get solved.   
In another paragraph of the article of Michael Langford, I believe   
that he had said that there are 10 methods. This again poses   
problem. There is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being  
still.   
I checked up Michael James who has worked with Sri Sadhu Om,   
and who has thoroughly learnt Tamizh. He says about the   
practice and number of hours: 1\. There is no fixed time. One can keep regularity of say half an hour or 1  
hour per day. This may be increased in course of time.   
2\. During other times, one should do either work for his livelihood   
or necessity but not turn the mind outwards towards unwanted things., like  
watching the road, watching other people, watching   
useless programmes in TV or reading worthless books etc.,   
3. Regarding closed eyes and open eyes, Bhagavan Ramana said to Annamalai Swami that closing the eyes, would keep the mind free, without using the senses, and so the mind will be more vigorous   
in thinking about various things. It is like throwing a ball on a wall, by  
standing closer to the wall, the ball would bounce back more vigorously since  
the distance to be covered would be less. Keeping the eyes open, can at least  
tell you that you mind is going outwards and seeing things that are worthless.  
The mind plus   
open eyes is better controlled than the mind plus shut eyes.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Summa iru, is not a method.   
when i am not summa iru. .. i will do inquiry, who is not just be state? That  
dissolves the "i" and i just AM.   
Dissolution of "I" can happen various ways. Listen to Arunachala Siva. That is  
Self inquiry too, coz the i dissolves leaving u summa iru.   
Self surrender through Love of God. .. Listening to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is  
also Self inquiry, coz it just dissolves the "I" and leaves one as Self.   
How many ways are there to fall asleep ? One would suggest have a pillow.  
Another would suggest have a good bed. Someone may say. .. just get tired!   
Get Tired with the world   
The method if "Awareness Watching Awareness" is Mind watching Siva. Like Nandi  
watching Siva. Turning away from the world and placing the mind on Awareness  
is indeed Self inquiry. Slowly mind merges in that Awareness. Coz it has  
nothing else. When my attention is on an object, the mind merges with that. ..  
when turned towards Self, its mind turned inwards.   
We all wrote on similar lines elsewhere. .. Please dont mind this, I feel : saying that this method is wrong appears to me to be the scholar problem. If  
you see a group of 10 scholars, they will not agree to each other. they might  
be talking the same thing, but still keep saying the other is wrong !!

Dear srkudai,   
Muruganar says in Padamalai Verse 2399: Through His gentle smile, radiant Padam joyfully declares: "Why   
this distress? Be happy by just REMAINING till".   
This can also be viewed in the context of the following from   
Maharshi's Gospel: Bhagavan: Your duty is to be, and not to be this or that. 'I am   
that I am' sums up the whole truth. THE METHOD IS SUMMARIZED IN 'BE STILL'.   
And what does stillness mean? It means 'destroy yourself', because, every  
name and form is the cause of trouble. 'I-I' is   
the Self. 'I am this' is the ego. When the 'I' is kept up as the   
'I' only, it is the Self. When it flies off at a tangent and says,   
'I am this or that', I am such and such', it is the ego.   
Verse 1217: Since becoming established in the state of the Self is both the  
means and the goal to be attained, remain still.   
Talks No. 322 is as under:-   
Question: What should one do in order to remain free from thoughts as advised  
by you? Is it only enquiry 'Who am I?'   
Bhagavan: Only to remain still. Do it and see.   
Question: It is impossible.   
Bhagavan: Exactly. For the same reason, the enquiry 'Who am I?' is advised.   
Verse 2328: The wonderful meaning of the supreme world [summa iru] is to know  
and rest in the Atma Swarupa through the enquriy   
'Who am I?'   
Verse 2114: Except by remaining still [summa iruttal] by what great tapas can  
the Atma Swarupam be attained in the Heart?   
Arunachala Siva.

I find there to be some contradictions between Sri Bhagavan's and Michael  
Langford's teachings. Michael Langford says that awareness watching awareness  
should be always done eyes shut, but Sri Bhagavan said that it is totally  
immaterial in Self-Enquiry and actually sometimes advised vichara to be done  
eyes open.   
Also, here is a dialogue with Sri Bhagavan and a questioner: D.: I do not understand what I should do.   
M: **If it is anything objective the way can be shown objectively. This   
is subjective.**   
D.: But I do not understand.   
M.: What! Do you not understand that you are?   
D.: Please tell me the way.   
M.: **Is it necessary to show the way in the interior of your own home?   
This is within you.**   
And here is another one   
D: "How to make the Quest, Who am I?   
M: " **The way is subjective, not objective; so it cannot and need not be  
shown by another**. Is it necessary to show anyone the way inside his own  
house? If the seeker keeps his mind still, that will be enough."   
Michael Langford however, gives atleast ten descriptions of his practice.

Dear snow,   
I agree with you. The problem with commentators is that they   
vitiate the essence of original message of the Master. For example,   
take Sri Sankara. He said Advaitam, the One without a second.   
But his followers were trying to out-do Sri Sankara. Subsequently,   
as one may see in Panchadasi and other works, there are two schools under Sri  
Sankara, the Bamati School and the Bhatta School. One says that one will have  
still the sports of Maya veiling him, till he attains videha kaivalyam, that  
is leaving the body in liberated state. The other school says Maya stops the  
sports, once you kill the ego, which is only Maya-swarupam. Both have a set  
of arguments to support their views. The whole essence of Advaitam is lost in  
this lingual diarrohea of commentators. If one attains   
advaitic siddhi, one should stop commenting. If you start addressing someone  
as different from you, you accept duality.   
Arunachala Siva.

Ongoing through the comments on Awareness Watching Awareness of Micheal  
Langford,doubts are expressed by members of this forum that awareness  
watching awareness cannot be the state of BEING.If the members go through  
the complete text of Mr.Langford, it will be clear that it is same as self  
enquiry.Mr. Micheal very clearly explains that Awareness watching awareness is  
nothing but turning our attention inwards.He has categorically mentioned that  
Awareness Watching awareness is Awareness Being Awareness   
He has clarified that because of long ancient habit of looking outwards  
towards people places and things,the word watching is used in practice  
instructions and that way we take the same habit of watching the people places  
and things and we shut our eyes and turn inwards.That is why the word watching  
is used.   
My question to devotees is that whether any of the member is able to turn his  
attention inwards without effort.As for i am concerned, I am not able to turn  
my attention inwards with out effort and the moment effort is lost,  
immediately mind turns outwards.The effort is put by Ego and not by Self and  
when ego comes in, then the thinker comes into play and so the duality.When a  
question was put to bhagavan on Choiceless Awareness(effortless awareness)  
advocated by JK(which is same as state of being), Bhagavan replied that it is  
same as Summa Iru and if one can attain that state then it is fine.However  
Bhagavan says that due to age old vasanas, a person cannot attain Choiceless  
awareness without effort and hence continuous effort is   
required.Tamil being an ancient language any ideas can be expressed very  
clearly without any distortion in Tamil.Bhagavan has composed most of his  
works in Tamil.Once it is translated in other language especially english, due  
to want of proper words, the meaning gets distorted even though the author  
may like to give exact meaning.Watching also falls in that category.

Dear Mr.Snow,   
With reference to your post as above, i reproduce below in italics from  
Mr.Langford's article from the web site <http://www.dosisnet.de/awa.pd>as wrt  
to duration of practice. _To change this long habit of looking outward you  
need to practice. Spend as many hours per day practicing as you can. If you  
only practice awareness watching awareness for 30 minutes per day and spend  
the other 23 and a half hours looking outward, you will not progress very  
quickly_   
From the above it is evident that Mr.Langford is inline with Bhagaan wrt  
duration of practice.

Also, 'AWA-method' seems to be a practice that is done on certain hours, but  
Bhagavan said that vichara should be done throughout the entire waking state.   
Dear Mr.Snow,   
With reference to your post as above, i reproduce below in italics from  
Mr.Langford's article from the web site <http://www.dosisnet.de/awa.pd>as wrt  
to duration of practice. _To change this long habit of looking outward you  
need to practice. Spend as many hours per day practicing as you can. If you  
only practice awareness watching awareness for 30 minutes per day and spend  
the other 23 and a half hours looking outward, you will not progress very  
quickly_   
From the above it is evident that Mr.Langford is inline with Bhagaan wrt  
duration of practice.   
Yes, i have read that. But as Michael Langford says, "the Awareness Watching  
Awareness Method is always to be done with the eyes closed."   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or  
not like this: A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes   
it happens that when the eyes are closed the latent thoughts rush forth with  
great vigour. It may also be difficult to   
introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of mind to do so.  
The mind is contaminated when it takes in   
objects. Otherwise, it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind  
active in its own pursuit without taking in   
external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
And here is another quote: Question: Is it enough if I spend some time in the mornings and some time in  
the evenings for this atma-vichara? Or should I do it always, even when I am  
writing or walking?   
A: What is your real nature? Is it writing, walking or being? The one  
unalterable reality is being. Until you realize that state of pure being you  
should pursue the enquiry. If once you are established in it there will be no  
further worry.No one will enquire into the source of thoughts unless thoughts  
arise. So long as you think I am walking or I am writing, enquire who does  
it.

Friends,   
 If we do not get "dogmatic", I think Awareness Watching awareness is just Self Inquiry. I do not understand why we have a problem with this method.   
After all, what the author is saying is: 1\. "You are Awareness" [Awareness is Brahman - SAT CHIT ANANDA, All  
Scriptures say this]   
2\. "turn away from the objects and put all attention on awareness" [Drop all  
objects and meditate on Brahman alone].   
3. "Rest in awareness" [Let the "I" remain with its source]   
I do not see any problem with this teaching. How many amongst us are really  
convinced that "I am Awareness" ?   
Why are we not convinced, if we are not? Ramana said it, Scriptures say it !   
This person, I am not aware of his actual life style, is just saying turn away  
from all objects and remain as Self.   
When a thought comes "I am hurt", revert attention to that which is aware of  
this. Though the wordings may sound different this is EXACTLY SELF INQUIRY.   
Observing awareness is not Self inquiry. But detaching from everything and  
remaining as Awareness is Summa Iru - JUST BE. Only problem will be mind will  
not allow it, it moves out. So the practice is to bring it back to the  
Awareness.   
Sitting meditation or sitting with closed eyes will be useful intially. But  
eventually it has to be 24 hours, eyes open or closed.   
Love!

Dear Mr.Snow,   
 It is clear from the reply given by bhagavan that it is difficult to introvert the mind with eyes open. When you keep the eyes open, not only the thought of objects seen by eye comes up in mind and disturbs u,but also thought of past and future comes up in mind. if you close your eyes, only thoughts of past and future will haunt you..So it is better to keep eyes closed instead open so that you have only one distraction instead of two..May be that a very advanced sadhaka will be able to meditate with eyes open but I have not so far seen in meditation hall of Ramanasramam any serious and sincere sadhaka meditating with eyes open.For that matter majority of peoplemeditate with eyes closed.That is the reason Mr.Langford has suggested to close the eyes.Bhagavan himself has told that what is important is to turn our attention inwards and it does not matter whether the eye is open or closed during meditation.   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or  
not like this: A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes   
it happens that when the eyes are closed the latent thoughts rush forth with

Ashtavakra Gita says : Yadi deham prtak kritya, chitti vishramya tistasi   
adhunaiva sukam shantam, bandha mukto bhavishyasi   
if you detach yourself from "Body" [including mind], and remain resting in  
Awareness   
Very soon [immediately ?], you shall find Bliss, Peace and release from all  
bondage.   
Relax into Awareness and detach from all external objects mentally.   
This is sadhana... A Valid method in all.   
Many people may have objection to his classification of saints. Some times  
saying Ramesh balsekar's teachings are not correct and some times about  
Lucknow. I am not sure why he makes these comments but i have my own  
agreements and disagreements on these mundane aspects.   
The method however is perfect.   
That said, is it the fastest method? I am not sure. A Bhakta might benefit  
from Surrender. But Self inquiry is not different from the method he is  
teaching.

Dear everyone,   
If one can take Awareness Wathing Awarness is Being Awareness,   
all problems do get solved.   
In another paragraph of the article of Michael Langford, I believe   
that he had said that there are 10 methods. This again poses   
problem. There is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being  
still.   
I checked up Michael James who has worked with Sri Sadhu Om,   
and who has thoroughly learnt Tamizh. He says about the   
practice and number of hours: 1\. There is no fixed time. One can keep regularity of say half an hour or 1  
hour per day. This may be increased in course of time.   
2\. During other times, one should do either work for his livelihood   
or necessity but not turn the mind outwards towards unwanted things., like  
watching the road, watching other people, watching   
useless programmes in TV or reading worthless books etc.,   
3. Regarding closed eyes and open eyes, Bhagavan Ramana said to Annamalai Swami that closing the eyes, would keep the mind free, without using the senses, and so the mind will be more vigorous   
in thinking about various things. It is like throwing a ball on a wall, by  
standing closer to the wall, the ball would bounce back more vigorously since  
the distance to be covered would be less. Keeping the eyes open, can at least  
tell you that you mind is going outwards and seeing things that are worthless.  
The mind plus   
open eyes is better controlled than the mind plus shut eyes.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Summa iru, is not a method.   
when i am not summa iru. .. i will do inquiry, who is not just be state? That  
dissolves the "i" and i just AM.   
Dissolution of "I" can happen various ways. Listen to Arunachala Siva. That is  
Self inquiry too, coz the i dissolves leaving u summa iru.   
Self surrender through Love of God. .. Listening to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is  
also Self inquiry, coz it just dissolves the "I" and leaves one as Self.   
How many ways are there to fall asleep ? One would suggest have a pillow.  
Another would suggest have a good bed. Someone may say. .. just get tired!   
Get Tired with the world   
The method if "Awareness Watching Awareness" is Mind watching Siva. Like Nandi  
watching Siva. Turning away from the world and placing the mind on Awareness  
is indeed Self inquiry. Slowly mind merges in that Awareness. Coz it has  
nothing else. When my attention is on an object, the mind merges with that. ..  
when turned towards Self, its mind turned inwards.   
We all wrote on similar lines elsewhere. .. Please dont mind this, I feel : saying that this method is wrong appears to me to be the scholar problem. If  
you see a group of 10 scholars, they will not agree to each other. they might  
be talking the same thing, but still keep saying the other is wrong !!

Dear srkudai,   
Muruganar says in Padamalai Verse 2399: Through His gentle smile, radiant Padam joyfully declares: "Why   
this distress? Be happy by just REMAINING till".   
This can also be viewed in the context of the following from   
Maharshi's Gospel: Bhagavan: Your duty is to be, and not to be this or that. 'I am   
that I am' sums up the whole truth. THE METHOD IS SUMMARIZED IN 'BE STILL'.   
And what does stillness mean? It means 'destroy yourself', because, every  
name and form is the cause of trouble. 'I-I' is   
the Self. 'I am this' is the ego. When the 'I' is kept up as the   
'I' only, it is the Self. When it flies off at a tangent and says,   
'I am this or that', I am such and such', it is the ego.   
Verse 1217: Since becoming established in the state of the Self is both the  
means and the goal to be attained, remain still.   
Talks No. 322 is as under:-   
Question: What should one do in order to remain free from thoughts as advised  
by you? Is it only enquiry 'Who am I?'   
Bhagavan: Only to remain still. Do it and see.   
Question: It is impossible.   
Bhagavan: Exactly. For the same reason, the enquiry 'Who am I?' is advised.   
Verse 2328: The wonderful meaning of the supreme world [summa iru] is to know  
and rest in the Atma Swarupa through the enquriy   
'Who am I?'   
Verse 2114: Except by remaining still [summa iruttal] by what great tapas can  
the Atma Swarupam be attained in the Heart?   
Arunachala Siva.

I find there to be some contradictions between Sri Bhagavan's and Michael  
Langford's teachings. Michael Langford says that awareness watching awareness  
should be always done eyes shut, but Sri Bhagavan said that it is totally  
immaterial in Self-Enquiry and actually sometimes advised vichara to be done  
eyes open.   
Also, here is a dialogue with Sri Bhagavan and a questioner: D.: I do not understand what I should do.   
M: **If it is anything objective the way can be shown objectively. This   
is subjective.**   
D.: But I do not understand.   
M.: What! Do you not understand that you are?   
D.: Please tell me the way.   
M.: **Is it necessary to show the way in the interior of your own home?   
This is within you.**   
And here is another one   
D: "How to make the Quest, Who am I?   
M: " **The way is subjective, not objective; so it cannot and need not be  
shown by another**. Is it necessary to show anyone the way inside his own  
house? If the seeker keeps his mind still, that will be enough."   
Michael Langford however, gives atleast ten descriptions of his practice.

Dear snow,   
I agree with you. The problem with commentators is that they   
vitiate the essence of original message of the Master. For example,   
take Sri Sankara. He said Advaitam, the One without a second.   
But his followers were trying to out-do Sri Sankara. Subsequently,   
as one may see in Panchadasi and other works, there are two schools under Sri  
Sankara, the Bamati School and the Bhatta School. One says that one will have  
still the sports of Maya veiling him, till he attains videha kaivalyam, that  
is leaving the body in liberated state. The other school says Maya stops the  
sports, once you kill the ego, which is only Maya-swarupam. Both have a set  
of arguments to support their views. The whole essence of Advaitam is lost in  
this lingual diarrohea of commentators. If one attains   
advaitic siddhi, one should stop commenting. If you start addressing someone  
as different from you, you accept duality.   
Arunachala Siva.

Ongoing through the comments on Awareness Watching Awareness of Micheal  
Langford,doubts are expressed by members of this forum that awareness  
watching awareness cannot be the state of BEING.If the members go through  
the complete text of Mr.Langford, it will be clear that it is same as self  
enquiry.Mr. Micheal very clearly explains that Awareness watching awareness is  
nothing but turning our attention inwards.He has categorically mentioned that  
Awareness Watching awareness is Awareness Being Awareness   
He has clarified that because of long ancient habit of looking outwards  
towards people places and things,the word watching is used in practice  
instructions and that way we take the same habit of watching the people places  
and things and we shut our eyes and turn inwards.That is why the word watching  
is used.   
My question to devotees is that whether any of the member is able to turn his  
attention inwards without effort.As for i am concerned, I am not able to turn  
my attention inwards with out effort and the moment effort is lost,  
immediately mind turns outwards.The effort is put by Ego and not by Self and  
when ego comes in, then the thinker comes into play and so the duality.When a  
question was put to bhagavan on Choiceless Awareness(effortless awareness)  
advocated by JK(which is same as state of being), Bhagavan replied that it is  
same as Summa Iru and if one can attain that state then it is fine.However  
Bhagavan says that due to age old vasanas, a person cannot attain Choiceless  
awareness without effort and hence continuous effort is   
required.Tamil being an ancient language any ideas can be expressed very  
clearly without any distortion in Tamil.Bhagavan has composed most of his  
works in Tamil.Once it is translated in other language especially english, due  
to want of proper words, the meaning gets distorted even though the author  
may like to give exact meaning.Watching also falls in that category.

Dear Mr.Snow,   
With reference to your post as above, i reproduce below in italics from  
Mr.Langford's article from the web site <http://www.dosisnet.de/awa.pd>as wrt  
to duration of practice. _To change this long habit of looking outward you  
need to practice. Spend as many hours per day practicing as you can. If you  
only practice awareness watching awareness for 30 minutes per day and spend

Yes, i have read that. But as Michael Langford says, "the Awareness Watching  
Awareness Method is always to be done with the eyes closed."   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or  
not like this: A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes   
it happens that when the eyes are closed the latent thoughts rush forth with  
great vigour. It may also be difficult to   
introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of mind to do so.  
The mind is contaminated when it takes in   
objects. Otherwise, it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind  
active in its own pursuit without taking in   
external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
And here is another quote: Question: Is it enough if I spend some time in the mornings and some time in  
the evenings for this atma-vichara? Or should I do it always, even when I am  
writing or walking?   
A: What is your real nature? Is it writing, walking or being? The one  
unalterable reality is being. Until you realize that state of pure being you  
should pursue the enquiry. If once you are established in it there will be no  
further worry.No one will enquire into the source of thoughts unless thoughts  
arise. So long as you think I am walking or I am writing, enquire who does  
it.

Friends,   
 If we do not get "dogmatic", I think Awareness Watching awareness is just Self Inquiry. I do not understand why we have a problem with this method.   
After all, what the author is saying is: 1\. "You are Awareness" [Awareness is Brahman - SAT CHIT ANANDA, All  
Scriptures say this]   
2\. "turn away from the objects and put all attention on awareness" [Drop all  
objects and meditate on Brahman alone].   
3. "Rest in awareness" [Let the "I" remain with its source]   
I do not see any problem with this teaching. How many amongst us are really  
convinced that "I am Awareness" ?   
Why are we not convinced, if we are not? Ramana said it, Scriptures say it !   
This person, I am not aware of his actual life style, is just saying turn away  
from all objects and remain as Self.   
When a thought comes "I am hurt", revert attention to that which is aware of  
this. Though the wordings may sound different this is EXACTLY SELF INQUIRY.   
Observing awareness is not Self inquiry. But detaching from everything and  
remaining as Awareness is Summa Iru - JUST BE. Only problem will be mind will  
not allow it, it moves out. So the practice is to bring it back to the  
Awareness.   
Sitting meditation or sitting with closed eyes will be useful intially. But  
eventually it has to be 24 hours, eyes open or closed.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Mr.Snow,   
 It is clear from the reply given by bhagavan that it is difficult to introvert the mind with eyes open. When you keep the eyes open, not only the thought of objects seen by eye comes up in mind and disturbs u,but also thought of past and future comes up in mind. if you close your eyes, only thoughts of past and future will haunt you..So it is better to keep eyes closed instead open so that you have only one distraction instead of two..May be that a very advanced sadhaka will be able to meditate with eyes open but I have not so far seen in meditation hall of Ramanasramam any serious and sincere sadhaka meditating with eyes open.For that matter majority of peoplemeditate with eyes closed.That is the reason Mr.Langford has suggested to close the eyes.Bhagavan himself has told that what is important is to turn our attention inwards and it does not matter whether the eye is open or closed during meditation.   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or  
not like this: A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes   
it happens that when the eyes are closed the latent thoughts rush forth with  
great vigour. **It may also be difficult to   
introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of mind to do so.  
The mind is contaminated when it takes in   
objects.** Otherwise, it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the  
mind active in its own pursuit without taking in   
external impressions or thinking of other matters

Ashtavakra Gita says : Yadi deham prtak kritya, chitti vishramya tistasi   
adhunaiva sukam shantam, bandha mukto bhavishyasi   
if you detach yourself from "Body" [including mind], and remain resting in  
Awareness   
Very soon [immediately ?], you shall find Bliss, Peace and release from all  
bondage.   
Relax into Awareness and detach from all external objects mentally.   
This is sadhana... A Valid method in all.   
Many people may have objection to his classification of saints. Some times  
saying Ramesh balsekar's teachings are not correct and some times about  
Lucknow. I am not sure why he makes these comments but i have my own  
agreements and disagreements on these mundane aspects.   
The method however is perfect.   
That said, is it the fastest method? I am not sure. A Bhakta might benefit  
from Surrender. But Self inquiry is not different from the method he is  
teaching.

Dear everyone,   
If one can take Awareness Wathing Awarness is Being Awareness,   
all problems do get solved.   
In another paragraph of the article of Michael Langford, I believe   
that he had said that there are 10 methods. This again poses   
problem. There is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being  
still.   
I checked up Michael James who has worked with Sri Sadhu Om,   
and who has thoroughly learnt Tamizh. He says about the   
practice and number of hours: 1\. There is no fixed time. One can keep regularity of say half an hour or 1  
hour per day. This may be increased in course of time.   
2\. During other times, one should do either work for his livelihood   
or necessity but not turn the mind outwards towards unwanted things., like  
watching the road, watching other people, watching   
useless programmes in TV or reading worthless books etc.,   
3. Regarding closed eyes and open eyes, Bhagavan Ramana said to Annamalai Swami that closing the eyes, would keep the mind free, without using the senses, and so the mind will be more vigorous   
in thinking about various things. It is like throwing a ball on a wall, by  
standing closer to the wall, the ball would bounce back more vigorously since  
the distance to be covered would be less. Keeping the eyes open, can at least  
tell you that you mind is going outwards and seeing things that are worthless.  
The mind plus   
open eyes is better controlled than the mind plus shut eyes.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Summa iru, is not a method.   
when i am not summa iru. .. i will do inquiry, who is not just be state? That  
dissolves the "i" and i just AM.   
Dissolution of "I" can happen various ways. Listen to Arunachala Siva. That is  
Self inquiry too, coz the i dissolves leaving u summa iru.   
Self surrender through Love of God. .. Listening to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is  
also Self inquiry, coz it just dissolves the "I" and leaves one as Self.   
How many ways are there to fall asleep ? One would suggest have a pillow.  
Another would suggest have a good bed. Someone may say. .. just get tired!   
Get Tired with the world   
The method if "Awareness Watching Awareness" is Mind watching Siva. Like Nandi  
watching Siva. Turning away from the world and placing the mind on Awareness  
is indeed Self inquiry. Slowly mind merges in that Awareness. Coz it has  
nothing else. When my attention is on an object, the mind merges with that. ..  
when turned towards Self, its mind turned inwards.   
We all wrote on similar lines elsewhere. .. Please dont mind this, I feel : saying that this method is wrong appears to me to be the scholar problem. If  
you see a group of 10 scholars, they will not agree to each other. they might  
be talking the same thing, but still keep saying the other is wrong !!

Dear srkudai,   
Muruganar says in Padamalai Verse 2399: Through His gentle smile, radiant Padam joyfully declares: "Why   
this distress? Be happy by just REMAINING till".   
This can also be viewed in the context of the following from   
Maharshi's Gospel: Bhagavan: Your duty is to be, and not to be this or that. 'I am   
that I am' sums up the whole truth. THE METHOD IS SUMMARIZED IN 'BE STILL'.   
And what does stillness mean? It means 'destroy yourself', because, every  
name and form is the cause of trouble. 'I-I' is   
the Self. 'I am this' is the ego. When the 'I' is kept up as the   
'I' only, it is the Self. When it flies off at a tangent and says,   
'I am this or that', I am such and such', it is the ego.   
Verse 1217: Since becoming established in the state of the Self is both the  
means and the goal to be attained, remain still.   
Talks No. 322 is as under:-   
Question: What should one do in order to remain free from thoughts as advised  
by you? Is it only enquiry 'Who am I?'   
Bhagavan: Only to remain still. Do it and see.   
Question: It is impossible.   
Bhagavan: Exactly. For the same reason, the enquiry 'Who am I?' is advised.   
Verse 2328: The wonderful meaning of the supreme world [summa iru] is to know  
and rest in the Atma Swarupa through the enquriy   
'Who am I?'   
Verse 2114: Except by remaining still [summa iruttal] by what great tapas can  
the Atma Swarupam be attained in the Heart?   
Arunachala Siva.

I find there to be some contradictions between Sri Bhagavan's and Michael  
Langford's teachings. Michael Langford says that awareness watching awareness  
should be always done eyes shut, but Sri Bhagavan said that it is totally  
immaterial in Self-Enquiry and actually sometimes advised vichara to be done  
eyes open.   
Also, here is a dialogue with Sri Bhagavan and a questioner: D.: I do not understand what I should do.   
M: **If it is anything objective the way can be shown objectively. This   
is subjective.**   
D.: But I do not understand.   
M.: What! Do you not understand that you are?   
D.: Please tell me the way.   
M.: **Is it necessary to show the way in the interior of your own home?   
This is within you.**   
And here is another one   
D: "How to make the Quest, Who am I?   
M: " **The way is subjective, not objective; so it cannot and need not be  
shown by another**. Is it necessary to show anyone the way inside his own  
house? If the seeker keeps his mind still, that will be enough."   
Michael Langford however, gives atleast ten descriptions of his practice.

Dear snow,   
I agree with you. The problem with commentators is that they   
vitiate the essence of original message of the Master. For example,   
take Sri Sankara. He said Advaitam, the One without a second.   
But his followers were trying to out-do Sri Sankara. Subsequently,   
as one may see in Panchadasi and other works, there are two schools under Sri  
Sankara, the Bamati School and the Bhatta School. One says that one will have  
still the sports of Maya veiling him, till he attains videha kaivalyam, that  
is leaving the body in liberated state. The other school says Maya stops the  
sports, once you kill the ego, which is only Maya-swarupam. Both have a set  
of arguments to support their views. The whole essence of Advaitam is lost in  
this lingual diarrohea of commentators. If one attains   
advaitic siddhi, one should stop commenting. If you start addressing someone  
as different from you, you accept duality.   
Arunachala Siva.

Ongoing through the comments on Awareness Watching Awareness of Micheal  
Langford,doubts are expressed by members of this forum that awareness  
watching awareness cannot be the state of BEING.If the members go through  
the complete text of Mr.Langford, it will be clear that it is same as self  
enquiry.Mr. Micheal very clearly explains that Awareness watching awareness is  
nothing but turning our attention inwards.He has categorically mentioned that  
Awareness Watching awareness is Awareness Being Awareness   
He has clarified that because of long ancient habit of looking outwards  
towards people places and things,the word watching is used in practice  
instructions and that way we take the same habit of watching the people places  
and things and we shut our eyes and turn inwards.That is why the word watching  
is used.   
My question to devotees is that whether any of the member is able to turn his  
attention inwards without effort.As for i am concerned, I am not able to turn  
my attention inwards with out effort and the moment effort is lost,  
immediately mind turns outwards.The effort is put by Ego and not by Self and  
when ego comes in, then the thinker comes into play and so the duality.When a  
question was put to bhagavan on Choiceless Awareness(effortless awareness)  
advocated by JK(which is same as state of being), Bhagavan replied that it is  
same as Summa Iru and if one can attain that state then it is fine.However  
Bhagavan says that due to age old vasanas, a person cannot attain Choiceless  
awareness without effort and hence continuous effort is   
required.Tamil being an ancient language any ideas can be expressed very  
clearly without any distortion in Tamil.Bhagavan has composed most of his  
works in Tamil.Once it is translated in other language especially english, due  
to want of proper words, the meaning gets distorted even though the author  
may like to give exact meaning.Watching also falls in that category.

Dear Mr.Snow,   
With reference to your post as above, i reproduce below in italics from  
Mr.Langford's article from the web site <http://www.dosisnet.de/awa.pd>as wrt  
to duration of practice. _To change this long habit of looking outward you  
need to practice. Spend as many hours per day practicing as you can. If you  
only practice awareness watching awareness for 30 minutes per day and spend  
the other 23 and a half hours looking outward, you will not progress very

From the above it is evident that Mr.Langford is inline with Bhagaan wrt

Yes, i have read that. But as Michael Langford says, "the Awareness Watching

And here is another quote: Question: Is it enough if I spend some time in the mornings and some time in  
the evenings for this atma-vichara? Or should I do it always, even when I am  
writing or walking?   
A: What is your real nature? Is it writing, walking or being? The one  
unalterable reality is being. Until you realize that state of pure being you  
should pursue the enquiry. If once you are established in it there will be no  
further worry.No one will enquire into the source of thoughts unless thoughts  
arise. So long as you think I am walking or I am writing, enquire who does  
it.

Friends,   
 If we do not get "dogmatic", I think Awareness Watching awareness is just Self Inquiry. I do not understand why we have a problem with this method.   
After all, what the author is saying is: 1\. "You are Awareness" [Awareness is Brahman - SAT CHIT ANANDA, All  
Scriptures say this]   
2\. "turn away from the objects and put all attention on awareness" [Drop all  
objects and meditate on Brahman alone].   
3. "Rest in awareness" [Let the "I" remain with its source]   
I do not see any problem with this teaching. How many amongst us are really  
convinced that "I am Awareness" ?   
Why are we not convinced, if we are not? Ramana said it, Scriptures say it !   
This person, I am not aware of his actual life style, is just saying turn away  
from all objects and remain as Self.   
When a thought comes "I am hurt", revert attention to that which is aware of  
this. Though the wordings may sound different this is EXACTLY SELF INQUIRY.   
Observing awareness is not Self inquiry. But detaching from everything and  
remaining as Awareness is Summa Iru - JUST BE. Only problem will be mind will  
not allow it, it moves out. So the practice is to bring it back to the  
Awareness.   
Sitting meditation or sitting with closed eyes will be useful intially. But  
eventually it has to be 24 hours, eyes open or closed.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Mr.Snow,   
 It is clear from the reply given by bhagavan that it is difficult to introvert the mind with eyes open. When you keep the eyes open, not only the thought of objects seen by eye comes up in mind and disturbs u,but also thought of past and future comes up in mind. if you close your eyes, only thoughts of past and future will haunt you..So it is better to keep eyes closed instead open so that you have only one distraction instead of two..May be that a very advanced sadhaka will be able to meditate with eyes open but I have not so far seen in meditation hall of Ramanasramam any serious and sincere sadhaka meditating with eyes open.For that matter majority of peoplemeditate with eyes closed.That is the reason Mr.Langford has suggested to close the eyes.Bhagavan himself has told that what is important is to turn our attention inwards and it does not matter whether the eye is open or closed during meditation.   
Where as Sri Bhagavan answer to the question whether eyes should be open or  
not like this: A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes   
it happens that when the eyes are closed the latent thoughts rush forth with  
great vigour. **It may also be difficult to   
introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of mind to do so.  
The mind is contaminated when it takes in   
objects.** Otherwise, it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the  
mind active in its own pursuit without taking in   
external impressions or thinking of other matters

Ashtavakra Gita says : Yadi deham prtak kritya, chitti vishramya tistasi   
adhunaiva sukam shantam, bandha mukto bhavishyasi   
if you detach yourself from "Body" [including mind], and remain resting in  
Awareness   
Very soon [immediately ?], you shall find Bliss, Peace and release from all  
bondage.   
Relax into Awareness and detach from all external objects mentally.   
This is sadhana... A Valid method in all.   
Many people may have objection to his classification of saints. Some times  
saying Ramesh balsekar's teachings are not correct and some times about  
Lucknow. I am not sure why he makes these comments but i have my own  
agreements and disagreements on these mundane aspects.   
The method however is perfect.   
That said, is it the fastest method? I am not sure. A Bhakta might benefit  
from Surrender. But Self inquiry is not different from the method he is  
teaching.

Dear everyone,   
If one can take Awareness Wathing Awarness is Being Awareness,   
all problems do get solved.   
In another paragraph of the article of Michael Langford, I believe   
that he had said that there are 10 methods. This again poses   
problem. There is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being  
still.   
I checked up Michael James who has worked with Sri Sadhu Om,   
and who has thoroughly learnt Tamizh. He says about the   
practice and number of hours: 1\. There is no fixed time. One can keep regularity of say half an hour or 1  
hour per day. This may be increased in course of time.   
2\. During other times, one should do either work for his livelihood   
or necessity but not turn the mind outwards towards unwanted things., like  
watching the road, watching other people, watching   
useless programmes in TV or reading worthless books etc.,   
3. Regarding closed eyes and open eyes, Bhagavan Ramana said to Annamalai Swami that closing the eyes, would keep the mind free, without using the senses, and so the mind will be more vigorous   
in thinking about various things. It is like throwing a ball on a wall, by  
standing closer to the wall, the ball would bounce back more vigorously since  
the distance to be covered would be less. Keeping the eyes open, can at least  
tell you that you mind is going outwards and seeing things that are worthless.  
The mind plus   
open eyes is better controlled than the mind plus shut eyes.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Summa iru, is not a method.   
when i am not summa iru. .. i will do inquiry, who is not just be state? That  
dissolves the "i" and i just AM.   
Dissolution of "I" can happen various ways. Listen to Arunachala Siva. That is  
Self inquiry too, coz the i dissolves leaving u summa iru.   
Self surrender through Love of God. .. Listening to Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is  
also Self inquiry, coz it just dissolves the "I" and leaves one as Self.   
How many ways are there to fall asleep ? One would suggest have a pillow.  
Another would suggest have a good bed. Someone may say. .. just get tired!   
Get Tired with the world   
The method if "Awareness Watching Awareness" is Mind watching Siva. Like Nandi  
watching Siva. Turning away from the world and placing the mind on Awareness  
is indeed Self inquiry. Slowly mind merges in that Awareness. Coz it has  
nothing else. When my attention is on an object, the mind merges with that. ..  
when turned towards Self, its mind turned inwards.   
We all wrote on similar lines elsewhere. .. Please dont mind this, I feel : saying that this method is wrong appears to me to be the scholar problem. If  
you see a group of 10 scholars, they will not agree to each other. they might  
be talking the same thing, but still keep saying the other is wrong !!

Dear srkudai,   
Muruganar says in Padamalai Verse 2399: Through His gentle smile, radiant Padam joyfully declares: "Why   
this distress? Be happy by just REMAINING till".   
This can also be viewed in the context of the following from   
Maharshi's Gospel: Bhagavan: Your duty is to be, and not to be this or that. 'I am   
that I am' sums up the whole truth. THE METHOD IS SUMMARIZED IN 'BE STILL'.   
And what does stillness mean? It means 'destroy yourself', because, every  
name and form is the cause of trouble. 'I-I' is   
the Self. 'I am this' is the ego. When the 'I' is kept up as the   
'I' only, it is the Self. When it flies off at a tangent and says,   
'I am this or that', I am such and such', it is the ego.   
Verse 1217: Since becoming established in the state of the Self is both the  
means and the goal to be attained, remain still.   
Talks No. 322 is as under:-   
Question: What should one do in order to remain free from thoughts as advised  
by you? Is it only enquiry 'Who am I?'   
Bhagavan: Only to remain still. Do it and see.   
Question: It is impossible.   
Bhagavan: Exactly. For the same reason, the enquiry 'Who am I?' is advised.   
Verse 2328: The wonderful meaning of the supreme world [summa iru] is to know  
and rest in the Atma Swarupa through the enquriy   
'Who am I?'   
Verse 2114: Except by remaining still [summa iruttal] by what great tapas can  
the Atma Swarupam be attained in the Heart?   
Arunachala Siva.

## Re:[30] Is 'Awareness Watching Awareness'-method same as Sri Bhagavan's Self- Attention?

Dear Devotees,   
 I would like to share some of my views on various comments by forum members. Members comments are given in bold and my comments are in italics.   
1\. AWA is not Self enquiry since the moment the word watching is used, then  
the   
 subject object relation ship comes into picture and hence it cannot be the state of   
 BEING..Also how can awareness be watched?   
 _  
Comments: Mr. Michael Langford has mentioned that Awareness Watching  
Awareness is Awareness Being Awareness and he also says that because of long  
ancient habit of looking outwards towards people places and things, the word  
watching is used in practice instructions. Also he says that that way we take  
that same habit of watching people, places and things and we shut our eyes and  
turn it inwards. That is why the word watching is used. **Mr.Michael Langford  
says that what is real is awareness watching awareness, looking inward. What  
is unreal is looking outward towards the world of people places and things.  
Hence AWA is in line with Bjhagavans Self Enquiry   
**There are some comments in the forum that how can awareness be watched? If  
the word watching is inappropriate, then a doubt arises in mind how the  
word enquiry is appropriate in Self enquiry. When the word enquiry is used  
then doubt arises about who should enquire and whether self can be enquired  
and if self can be enquired then there must be enquirer similar to watcher in  
the word watching. All these doubts do not arise if tamil word SUMMA IRU is  
used to denote self enquiry**. Bhagavan ramana maharishi has instructed my  
mother around 80 years ago when she was a child that she should read  
Bhagavans works in the same language in which it was originally composed.I  
remember to have read some where that Bhagavan has given similar  
instructions to Annamalai Swami. Bhagavan has composed his great works such  
as   
 Nan Yar, Upadesa Undiar, Ulladhu Naarpathu,Arunachala Akshara mana malai etc  
in Tamil and when it is translated in other languages, it does not convey the  
same meaning as in tamil.. **In this context, I would like members to go  
through the commentary in English on Nan Yar by Mr.Michel James where in he  
uses the same original tamil words in many places in his commentary to  
ensure that the meaning is not distorted.**_   
[/b]   
2.As per AWA, it should be done on certain hours.   
 _Comments:Mr Michael Langford says that spend as many hours per day  
practicing as you can. **If you only practice awareness watching awareness for  
30 minutes per day and spend the other 23 and a half hours looking outward,  
you will not progress very quickly. If you want rapid results, then drop your  
unnecessary activities to free up time so you can practice for many hours per  
day, everyday. Maybe once per week on one of your days off from work you can  
devote the whole day to just practicing awareness watching awareness. Again  
this is in line with Bhagavans teachings that vichara should be done  
throughout the entire waking state   
**_ [/b]   
3.As per AWA, one should practice with eyes closed.   
 _Comments:To a question put to Bhagavan whether eyes should be open or not  
like this Bhagaan answers thus   
A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes it happens that when the eyes are  
closed the latent thoughts rush forth with great vigour. It may also be  
difficult to introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of  
mind to do so. The mind is contaminated when it takes in objects. Otherwise,  
it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind active in its own  
pursuit without taking in external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
 **From the very first sentence in Bhagavan s answer, it is evident that it  
may be done either way.**   
_   
4.As per AWA,ten methods are suggested and how can there be 10 methods since  
there is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being still.   
 _Comments: In Hinduism, four margas(paths) are prescribed for realization  
and devotees can follow any marga to reach the goal of Self realization. In  
Guru Ramana Mr.Cohen, quotes Bhagavan and says that the ultimate goal is  
realize the self and the paths are left to individuals. In fact, Bhagavan has  
told that Bakthi and Jnana are one and the same. In this context, I would like  
to quote an explanation given by late Paramacharya of Kanchi Mutt Sri  
Chandrasekara Saraswathi Swamigal. A devotee had a genuine doubt and asked  
Paramacharya why Paramacharya is confined to pujas and rituals and does not  
perform siddhis(miracles) like Sri. Sathya Sai Baba.. Paramacharya replied  
that the goal of his and Sri.Sathya Sa Baba are one and the same ie to bring  
everybody in to divinity and only difference is that they adopt different  
techniques like marketing people adopt different techniques to sell the goods.   
Bhagvan has given all the spiritual instructions very crystal clear and in  
simple language. In spite of that, during his life time, we can find devotees  
going on questioning about self enquiry again and again and this is evident  
if we go through the bookTalks wherein similar questions on self enquiry  
are repeated at number of places by different devotees. These devotees who put  
questions to hagavan are not ordinary layman but intellectuals and highly  
learned. **In order to cater to needs of people with different caliber,  
Micheal has given different methods and he is not suggested to follow all  
methods. It is left to individuals to follow the method which suits him  
best.This is in line with Bhagavan suggesting two methods ie doing sadhana  
with closed eyes and with open eyes. Which ever suits a devotee, he can follow  
it. Ultimately, the goal is to turn our attention inwards to the subject from  
objects.**   
 **All 10 methods suggested by Mr.Michael boils down to turning the  
attention inwards only and nothing else. Once a devotee becomes proficient in  
practice, he can practice sadhana eyes closed/open, one hour a day to 24  
hours a day,walking/sitting /laying/at rest room/ brushing his teeth. Only  
time he cannot do is while at sleep and when he is actively engaged in any  
work.When he is engaged in any serious activity, he automatically goes into  
meditation since his full attention is on that activity and there no  
thoughts**.   
**To conclude, I am fully convinced by Bhagavans teaching that at some  
point of time, we should forget what we have learned, stop reading books and  
turn our attention inwards. By mere reading various scriptures and endless  
discussion does not lead to realization unless we practice what we have  
learned.. To quote swami Sivananda of Rishikesh, an ounce of practice is  
better than tons of reading. In Sanskrit, it is known as Sravanam, mananam and  
Nithidyasanam and in Tirukkural, Tiruvallur says Karka Kashadara  
Karka.karrapin Nirka Thaga when means read and understand well and then  
practice what you have learnt. Do we[/b_**]?

It is the tendancy of our nature that we complicate things by not only our own  
analysis but also analysis of analyses itself.   
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
These are just tools for 'I' so that it can simply continue in the garb of  
spiritual enquiry and enjoy its existence. It does not at akk matter if  
awareness is watching awareness or awareness is not watching awareness,  
whether Ramana's teachings are same as Michal James or different, whether  
Bhakti yoga is same as Jnana Yoga or different. Whether my point is accepted  
here or rejected. whether the discussions is helping or not.   
'I' \- just hold on to it, everything else is play and only play: Merry-  
Go-Round   
Self Enquiry is like the passive observer. A classic example which Shankara  
Bhagavatpadal has given is that of the bird Dove which lays eggs and carefully  
guards it everyday and accumulates food for it from various places and when  
the eggs are going to hatch, one day the crow comes pushes the eggs down from  
the nest and eats all the eggs and just born dove. The dove, which comes there  
just sees all this without reaction. It just remains.   
Such should be our enquiry.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Here is the classic pic taken from the famous movie Adi Shankaracharya. Its  
one of the best examples as to how our enquiry has to be carried on: Crow and dove.Crow is the doer, the active one.The dove is the passive  
observer, the atman(inner self) - our attention should be always focussed only  
on this.   
instead of focusing our attention on the 'I', if the Dove begins to fight with  
the crow, it is only going to cause damage and loss of peace. Just remaining  
indifferent to what is happening, remaining in the world, carrying out our  
duties, we should remain like the Dove with our attention focused on the Self  
till our Prarabhha karma is dissolved.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Mr.Nagaraj,   
 I agree with your comments as above.When we know that who am I is simply holding on to the "I", why so many posts in this forum on various headings on various topics?. **Bhagavan has given his first teaching "Naan Yar' crystal clear without any room for doubt and still do we require endless discussions on his teachings ?** **It is enough if only Bhagavan 's teachings alone are published in this site as being done by Sri Subramanian and Mr.Prasanth (Both of them are doing great service) and there are sufficient material for them to publish more of Bhagaan's works for many years**.This will help members who have not so far gone thro his books and for the one who has already gone through, it will help to refresh.Few years back, Swami Chinmayananda was invited to a Ramana function and was asked to deliver his talk on Bhagavan Ramana.He did not deliver lecture and instead sat in silence forsome time and at the end told the audience that this is what bhagavan's teaching. **Bhagavan says that Silence is ever speaking and it is interrupted by speaking.Are we following his teachings?

Dear viswanathan   
I agree with your detailed clarfifcations on the points of Michael   
Langford 'Awareness Watching Awareness'. The problems in   
any translation of the original work are that one has to compromise   
with some loss of beauty and cadence. A friend of mine, long time   
back, went to study Russian, to read Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace   
in original. But most of us cannot do that way. Why? Even Tamizhians today  
cannot properly read and understand classical   
Tamizh works like Bhagavan's ULLadu Narpadu. The untranslatatbility of Tamizh  
is quite high. In Tamizh, one often goes even without a verb. Nan Yaar means  
only "I Who" and not   
"Who am I?" Hence many problems have to be confronted by the   
translators. So long as Langford clarifies Watching means Being,   
then, as I already wrote, there is no problem. Even in Sanskrit,   
sometimes the word Darshan means not seeing but being. Siva darshan sometimes  
means Being Siva or Being in Sivam.   
As regards methods, again since every marga leads one ultimately to the one  
marga of self attention, there is no quarrel, in that sense.   
I also refer to Michael James as you have mentioned. He is the guy who read  
and mastered Tamizh while simultaneously venturing understanding and  
practicing Bhagavan Ramana's methods. Hence his books and translations are  
really of a higher order. In his   
Happiness and the Art of Being, he refers to ULLadu Narpadu   
verses and he always gives in italics the Tamizh word or phrases and again and  
again use many ways to describe the purport.   
Arunachala Siva.

OK   
How many of you tried "Awareness Watching Awareness" and found it different  
from Remaining as Self or Self inquiry?   
I tried it, and i see that its just the same. I do not find any difference.  
Whether one says, remain as Awareness within or Be Still, how does it matter?   
Its just the same!

 I agree with your comments as above.When we know that who am I is simply holding on to the "I", why so many posts in this forum on various headings on various topics?. **Bhagavan has given his first teaching "Naan Yar' crystal clear without any room for doubt and still do we require endless discussions on his teachings ?** **It is enough if only Bhagavan 's teachings alone are published in this site as being done by Sri Subramanian and Mr.Prasanth (Both of them are doing great service) and there are sufficient material for them to publish more of Bhagaan's works for many years**.This will help members who have not so far gone thro his books and for the one who has already gone through, it will help to refresh.Few years back, Swami Chinmayananda was invited to a Ramana function and was asked to deliver his talk on Bhagavan Ramana.He did not deliver lecture and instead sat in silence forsome time and at the end told the audience that this is what bhagavan's teaching. **Bhagavan says that Silence is ever speaking and it is interrupted by speaking.Are we following his teachings?**  
You are absolutely correct. The best course is to simply maintain silence. I  
have always found the tamizh works of Ramana more clearer than any of the  
other languages, it may be because it is my mother tongue, but I did not know  
how to read or write tamizh, but due to Bhagavan's grace, I am learning to  
read and write tamizh now atleast I am able to read it slowly though.   
Personally, I feel, Bhagavan's teachings are to be discussed within the Self  
alone, in the course of enquiry itself and not outside. One has to taste the  
tea himself to know its taste, no matter what elaboration anybody gives, is  
going to be of no avail.   
It is due to the Vasana of finding out answers to our questions that breeds  
questions and endless discussions. Bhagavans says, we need not know any  
answers at all. We fail to recognise the very presence of Bhagavan Ramana, if  
he is not there physically, does it mean that he is not going to clear our  
questions within? its because of this wrong notion, that we begin to discuss  
our issues or questions and it leads to analyses over analyses. What we need  
is a strong belief or Faith or Shraddha that Bhagavan will clear all doubts  
Himself and I need not ask anybody and that He himself will reveal it to me in  
any way, maybe an unknown person would come and say something in some other  
context, or through some incidents. We just need to remain alive and keep the  
enquiry always going. Like how Dhathathreya had 24 Gurus, most of them being  
animals, in a similar way, Bhagavan will bestow on us the clarity in some way  
or the other.   
To ask doubts and discussing it is going outwards. We have to remain within  
our self - holding on just to 'I' alone.   
In Talks: 253: Bhagavan has said The illiterates are certainly better off than the  
literates whose egos are not destroyed by the quest of the self.   
355: "Illiteracy is ignorance: education is learned ignorance. Both of them  
are ignorant of their true aim; whereas a sage is not ignorant because there  
is no aim for him."   
D.: Mind itself is very subtle and is also the same as the Atman.   
How shall we know the nature of the mind? You have said that all   
supports are useless. What should be our stand then?   
M.: Where does your mind stand?   
D.: Where does it stand?   
M.: Ask the mind itself.   
D.: I ask you now. Should we concentrate on mind then?   
M.: Um!   
D.: But what is the nature of the mind? It is formless. The problem   
is perplexing.   
M.: Why are you perplexed?   
D.: The sastras want us to concentrate and I cannot do so.   
M.: Through what sastras have we known our existence?   
D.: It is a matter of experience. But I want to concentrate.   
M.: Be free from thoughts. Do not hold on to anything. They do not   
hold you. Be yourself.   
D.: I do not yet understand as to where I take my stand and concentrate.   
Can I meditate on my mind?   
M.: Whose mind?   
D.: My own mind?   
M.: Who are you? The question now resolves itself all right.   
(All retired for lunch. The visitor returned at 2-30 p.m. and pursued   
the same question.)   
He said: Maharshi advises the seeker to get rid of thoughts. On what   
should I concentrate the mind after all the thoughts are expelled? I   
do not see where I stand then and on what I should concentrate.   
M.: For whom is the concentration?   
D.: For the mind.   
M.: Then concentrate the mind.   
D.: On what?   
M.: Answer the question yourself. What is the mind? Why should   
you concentrate?   
D.: I do not know what the mind is. I ask Maharshi.   
M.: Maharshi does not seek to know the mind. The questioner must   
question the mind itself as to what it is.   
 **D.: Maharshi advises that the mind should be divested of thoughts.   
M.: This is itself a thought.**   
D.: When all thoughts disappear what remains over?   
M.: Is the mind different from thoughts?   
 **D.: No. The mind is made up of thoughts. My point is this: When all   
thoughts are got rid of, how shall I concentrate the mind?   
M.: Is not this also a thought?**   
D.: Yes, but I am advised to concentrate.   
M.: Why should you concentrate? Why should you not allow your   
thoughts free play?   
D.: The sastras say that the thoughts, thus playing free, lead us astray,   
that is, to unreal and changeful things.   
M.: So then, you want not to be led to unreal and changeful things. Your   
thoughts are unreal and changeful. You want to hold the Reality. That   
is exactly what I say. The thoughts are unreal. Get rid of them.   
 **D.: I understand now. Yet there is a doubt. Not a trice can you remain   
inactive. How shall I be able to rid myself of thoughts?   
M.: The same Gita says: Although all actions take place, I am not the doer.   
It is like the sun towards the world activities. The Self always remains   
actionless, whereas thoughts arise and subside. The Self is Perfection; it   
is immutable; the mind is limited and changeful. You need only to cast   
off your limitations. Your perfection thus stands revealed.**   
D.: Grace is necessary for it.   
 _ **M.: Grace is ever present. All that is necessary is that you surrender to  
It.**_   
D.: I surrender and pray that even if I go wrong I may be forcibly   
drawn to it.   
 **M.: Is this surrender? Surrender to be complete must be   
unquestioning.**   
D.: Yes, I surrender. You say I must dive into the ocean of the Self   
like a pearl-diver into the sea.   
M.: Because you are now thinking that you are out of the ocean of   
Consciousness.   
D.: I practise pranayama. It generates heat in the body. What should   
I do?   
M.: The heat will pass away when the mind gains calm   
D.: That is true but most difficult.   
 **M.: This is again a thought which is an obstacle.

Thought is an obstacle if i am moving in the thought world.   
how can thought obstruct the Self?   
how can a building obstruct the space?   
I am not saying Sri Ramana is wrong.   
i am just saying, the person who recorded it might not have done it all that  
well!

I agree with Udai agru.   
Even Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami also says the same thing.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Mano Nasam means only destruction of  
ignorance in the mind but not destruction of mind.   
If really problems solve by killing our mind then it can be solved by taking  
some injection like anaesthesia. :-)   
So solution is to know that we are not the mind and it is mithya i.e dependent  
on our real naturre i.e sat-chit-ananda.

Dear I,   
I would rather put it this way: When the glass tumbler is half filled with water. One says its half filled and  
the other says its half empty.   
Thats all is the difference.

The point is : mind cannot be killed, coz its never alive to be killed.   
like the snake on a rope. should the snake be killed?   
i am awareness, right now -- there is no choice here.   
and as awareness, i "CANNOT" get sad, happy or anything else. AS AWareness, i  
a Every STillness.   
so its not "Be Still" \-- u R STILLNESS. .. no choice here!   
so when someone says "I WILL BE STILL" thats foolish. As Awareness there is no  
choice. One is STILLNESS ITSELF.   
AS mind, one cannot remain still... coz mind by nature is unreal. mind cannot  
become SAT.   
So, here is the problem. People want the mind to be Still... body to stop  
growing!! how is it ever possible.   
body by its nature has to grow old. mind by its nature has to change. Self  
cannot Change.   
This is the essence.   
Swami Suddhananda gives a nice example: Someone was asked "What is ur age", he  
said "30". "But u said the same thing 10 years ago", asked another who was  
present there. "That is right, i tell the truth and truth cannot change", was  
his reply!   
what kind of truth is that??   
The attempt to stop the mirage like world from appearing is also a mistake.  
coz it shall continue as long as one's prarabdha is there unfinished. no one  
can stop it.   
Love!   
Silence

The very entity which also says that mind cannot be killed is mind itself.   
In the snake and rope example, snake is an illusion - Mithya and the rope is  
Asat.

Awareness is completely pure. Why is there a need to affirm that I am  
awareness? and to whom is this made?

yes. its mind that is saying.   
and that knowledge "u r awareness" is required for mind only.   
coz, the Self never needs this knowledge. Body cannot have it.   
Its very simple.   
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too?   
is not the instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for  
mind.   
MITHYA and ASAT have one basic difference. Mithya is like a mirage. it appears  
to be present, though its purely ASAT.   
So one cannot stop the appearance. it continues.

Dear I,   
In total agreement with your points, I would like to bring in my views in the  
same example quoted by you: Quote from: srkudai on June 28, 2010, 12:47:37 PM  
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too? is not the instruction "u r not this,  
but that which is outside", its for mind.   
Silence  
when the sage comes on the screen and says u are not this, you are not that  
and etc... and what ever you decide to do: 1 Stop the movie,   
2 continue the movie   
3 follow the sage   
4 not listen the sage   
5 do self enquiry   
6 letting the movie continue by allowing the assitant director to decide on  
the next scenarios believing that it cannot affect me, etc...   
these are still part of the movie itself. These are all the various courses  
the mind has, as options in the movie, as the director. These are "Freewill"  
which the i believes it has, which it can use to do what i wants to.   
Movie is in reality, not there at all, movie exist only for the mind alone  
which is non-self. In ignorance, the character itself, is the one which has  
created the movie and various scenarios and also the sage who comes and says  
you are not this you are that is just another character in the movie created  
by the mind again to make the movie more interesting, thats all.   
Once the character discards his dress knowing its limitedness - means there is  
no more i at all, no director at all, there is no more movie anymore. Movie  
existed only for the mithya i.   
The instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for mind." is  
itself just Mithya as well. It is just a story in the movie, which the i gets  
identified with whereby 'i' mistakenly takes these instruction for itself and  
begins to enquire who am i, I am the Self, I am this and I am that. these are  
all again just illusions. There is no need for self enquiry as well.   
There is no movie at all.   
Appearance is only for the 'i' mind alone. as long as the mind exists  
appearances will continue, as appearances are all the creations of the mind  
alone. Where there are no appearances and where only  
awareness/consciousness/Self alone IS, is real. _Where appearances still are_  
, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.

Dear Devotees,   
 I would like to share some of my views on various comments by forum members. Members comments are given in bold and my comments are in italics.   
1\. AWA is not Self enquiry since the moment the word watching is used, then  
the   
 subject object relation ship comes into picture and hence it cannot be the state of   
 BEING..Also how can awareness be watched?   
 _  
Comments: Mr. Michael Langford has mentioned that Awareness Watching  
Awareness is Awareness Being Awareness and he also says that because of long  
ancient habit of looking outwards towards people places and things, the word  
watching is used in practice instructions. Also he says that that way we take  
that same habit of watching people, places and things and we shut our eyes and  
turn it inwards. That is why the word watching is used. **Mr.Michael Langford  
says that what is real is awareness watching awareness, looking inward. What  
is unreal is looking outward towards the world of people places and things.  
Hence AWA is in line with Bjhagavans Self Enquiry   
**There are some comments in the forum that how can awareness be watched? If  
the word watching is inappropriate, then a doubt arises in mind how the  
word enquiry is appropriate in Self enquiry. When the word enquiry is used  
then doubt arises about who should enquire and whether self can be enquired  
and if self can be enquired then there must be enquirer similar to watcher in  
the word watching. All these doubts do not arise if tamil word SUMMA IRU is  
used to denote self enquiry**. Bhagavan ramana maharishi has instructed my  
mother around 80 years ago when she was a child that she should read  
Bhagavans works in the same language in which it was originally composed.I  
remember to have read some where that Bhagavan has given similar  
instructions to Annamalai Swami. Bhagavan has composed his great works such  
as   
 Nan Yar, Upadesa Undiar, Ulladhu Naarpathu,Arunachala Akshara mana malai etc  
in Tamil and when it is translated in other languages, it does not convey the  
same meaning as in tamil.. **In this context, I would like members to go  
through the commentary in English on Nan Yar by Mr.Michel James where in he  
uses the same original tamil words in many places in his commentary to  
ensure that the meaning is not distorted.**_   
[/b]   
2.As per AWA, it should be done on certain hours.   
 _Comments:Mr Michael Langford says that spend as many hours per day  
practicing as you can. **If you only practice awareness watching awareness for  
30 minutes per day and spend the other 23 and a half hours looking outward,  
you will not progress very quickly. If you want rapid results, then drop your  
unnecessary activities to free up time so you can practice for many hours per  
day, everyday. Maybe once per week on one of your days off from work you can  
devote the whole day to just practicing awareness watching awareness. Again  
this is in line with Bhagavans teachings that vichara should be done  
throughout the entire waking state   
**_ [/b]   
3.As per AWA, one should practice with eyes closed.   
 _Comments:To a question put to Bhagavan whether eyes should be open or not  
like this Bhagaan answers thus   
A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes it happens that when the eyes are  
closed the latent thoughts rush forth with great vigour. It may also be  
difficult to introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of  
mind to do so. The mind is contaminated when it takes in objects. Otherwise,  
it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind active in its own  
pursuit without taking in external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
 **From the very first sentence in Bhagavan s answer, it is evident that it  
may be done either way.**   
_   
4.As per AWA,ten methods are suggested and how can there be 10 methods since  
there is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being still.   
 _Comments: In Hinduism, four margas(paths) are prescribed for realization  
and devotees can follow any marga to reach the goal of Self realization. In  
Guru Ramana Mr.Cohen, quotes Bhagavan and says that the ultimate goal is  
realize the self and the paths are left to individuals. In fact, Bhagavan has  
told that Bakthi and Jnana are one and the same. In this context, I would like  
to quote an explanation given by late Paramacharya of Kanchi Mutt Sri  
Chandrasekara Saraswathi Swamigal. A devotee had a genuine doubt and asked  
Paramacharya why Paramacharya is confined to pujas and rituals and does not  
perform siddhis(miracles) like Sri. Sathya Sai Baba.. Paramacharya replied  
that the goal of his and Sri.Sathya Sa Baba are one and the same ie to bring  
everybody in to divinity and only difference is that they adopt different  
techniques like marketing people adopt different techniques to sell the goods.   
Bhagvan has given all the spiritual instructions very crystal clear and in  
simple language. In spite of that, during his life time, we can find devotees  
going on questioning about self enquiry again and again and this is evident  
if we go through the bookTalks wherein similar questions on self enquiry  
are repeated at number of places by different devotees. These devotees who put  
questions to hagavan are not ordinary layman but intellectuals and highly  
learned. **In order to cater to needs of people with different caliber,  
Micheal has given different methods and he is not suggested to follow all  
methods. It is left to individuals to follow the method which suits him  
best.This is in line with Bhagavan suggesting two methods ie doing sadhana  
with closed eyes and with open eyes. Which ever suits a devotee, he can follow  
it. Ultimately, the goal is to turn our attention inwards to the subject from  
objects.**   
 **All 10 methods suggested by Mr.Michael boils down to turning the  
attention inwards only and nothing else. Once a devotee becomes proficient in  
practice, he can practice sadhana eyes closed/open, one hour a day to 24  
hours a day,walking/sitting /laying/at rest room/ brushing his teeth. Only  
time he cannot do is while at sleep and when he is actively engaged in any  
work.When he is engaged in any serious activity, he automatically goes into  
meditation since his full attention is on that activity and there no  
thoughts**.   
**To conclude, I am fully convinced by Bhagavans teaching that at some  
point of time, we should forget what we have learned, stop reading books and  
turn our attention inwards. By mere reading various scriptures and endless  
discussion does not lead to realization unless we practice what we have  
learned.. To quote swami Sivananda of Rishikesh, an ounce of practice is  
better than tons of reading. In Sanskrit, it is known as Sravanam, mananam and  
Nithidyasanam and in Tirukkural, Tiruvallur says Karka Kashadara  
Karka.karrapin Nirka Thaga when means read and understand well and then  
practice what you have learnt. Do we[/b_**]?

It is the tendancy of our nature that we complicate things by not only our own  
analysis but also analysis of analyses itself.   
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
These are just tools for 'I' so that it can simply continue in the garb of  
spiritual enquiry and enjoy its existence. It does not at akk matter if  
awareness is watching awareness or awareness is not watching awareness,  
whether Ramana's teachings are same as Michal James or different, whether  
Bhakti yoga is same as Jnana Yoga or different. Whether my point is accepted  
here or rejected. whether the discussions is helping or not.   
'I' \- just hold on to it, everything else is play and only play: Merry-  
Go-Round   
Self Enquiry is like the passive observer. A classic example which Shankara  
Bhagavatpadal has given is that of the bird Dove which lays eggs and carefully  
guards it everyday and accumulates food for it from various places and when  
the eggs are going to hatch, one day the crow comes pushes the eggs down from  
the nest and eats all the eggs and just born dove. The dove, which comes there  
just sees all this without reaction. It just remains.   
Such should be our enquiry.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Here is the classic pic taken from the famous movie Adi Shankaracharya. Its  
one of the best examples as to how our enquiry has to be carried on: Crow and dove.Crow is the doer, the active one.The dove is the passive  
observer, the atman(inner self) - our attention should be always focussed only  
on this.   
instead of focusing our attention on the 'I', if the Dove begins to fight with  
the crow, it is only going to cause damage and loss of peace. Just remaining  
indifferent to what is happening, remaining in the world, carrying out our  
duties, we should remain like the Dove with our attention focused on the Self  
till our Prarabhha karma is dissolved.

Dear Mr.Nagaraj,   
 I agree with your comments as above.When we know that who am I is simply holding on to the "I", why so many posts in this forum on various headings on various topics?. **Bhagavan has given his first teaching "Naan Yar' crystal clear without any room for doubt and still do we require endless discussions on his teachings ?** **It is enough if only Bhagavan 's teachings alone are published in this site as being done by Sri Subramanian and Mr.Prasanth (Both of them are doing great service) and there are sufficient material for them to publish more of Bhagaan's works for many years**.This will help members who have not so far gone thro his books and for the one who has already gone through, it will help to refresh.Few years back, Swami Chinmayananda was invited to a Ramana function and was asked to deliver his talk on Bhagavan Ramana.He did not deliver lecture and instead sat in silence forsome time and at the end told the audience that this is what bhagavan's teaching. **Bhagavan says that Silence is ever speaking and it is interrupted by speaking.Are we following his teachings?

Dear viswanathan   
I agree with your detailed clarfifcations on the points of Michael   
Langford 'Awareness Watching Awareness'. The problems in   
any translation of the original work are that one has to compromise   
with some loss of beauty and cadence. A friend of mine, long time   
back, went to study Russian, to read Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace   
in original. But most of us cannot do that way. Why? Even Tamizhians today  
cannot properly read and understand classical   
Tamizh works like Bhagavan's ULLadu Narpadu. The untranslatatbility of Tamizh  
is quite high. In Tamizh, one often goes even without a verb. Nan Yaar means  
only "I Who" and not   
"Who am I?" Hence many problems have to be confronted by the   
translators. So long as Langford clarifies Watching means Being,   
then, as I already wrote, there is no problem. Even in Sanskrit,   
sometimes the word Darshan means not seeing but being. Siva darshan sometimes  
means Being Siva or Being in Sivam.   
As regards methods, again since every marga leads one ultimately to the one  
marga of self attention, there is no quarrel, in that sense.   
I also refer to Michael James as you have mentioned. He is the guy who read  
and mastered Tamizh while simultaneously venturing understanding and  
practicing Bhagavan Ramana's methods. Hence his books and translations are  
really of a higher order. In his   
Happiness and the Art of Being, he refers to ULLadu Narpadu   
verses and he always gives in italics the Tamizh word or phrases and again and  
again use many ways to describe the purport.   
Arunachala Siva.

OK   
How many of you tried "Awareness Watching Awareness" and found it different  
from Remaining as Self or Self inquiry?   
I tried it, and i see that its just the same. I do not find any difference.  
Whether one says, remain as Awareness within or Be Still, how does it matter?   
Its just the same!

You are absolutely correct. The best course is to simply maintain silence. I  
have always found the tamizh works of Ramana more clearer than any of the  
other languages, it may be because it is my mother tongue, but I did not know  
how to read or write tamizh, but due to Bhagavan's grace, I am learning to  
read and write tamizh now atleast I am able to read it slowly though.   
Personally, I feel, Bhagavan's teachings are to be discussed within the Self  
alone, in the course of enquiry itself and not outside. One has to taste the  
tea himself to know its taste, no matter what elaboration anybody gives, is  
going to be of no avail.   
It is due to the Vasana of finding out answers to our questions that breeds  
questions and endless discussions. Bhagavans says, we need not know any  
answers at all. We fail to recognise the very presence of Bhagavan Ramana, if  
he is not there physically, does it mean that he is not going to clear our  
questions within? its because of this wrong notion, that we begin to discuss  
our issues or questions and it leads to analyses over analyses. What we need  
is a strong belief or Faith or Shraddha that Bhagavan will clear all doubts  
Himself and I need not ask anybody and that He himself will reveal it to me in  
any way, maybe an unknown person would come and say something in some other  
context, or through some incidents. We just need to remain alive and keep the  
enquiry always going. Like how Dhathathreya had 24 Gurus, most of them being  
animals, in a similar way, Bhagavan will bestow on us the clarity in some way  
or the other.   
To ask doubts and discussing it is going outwards. We have to remain within  
our self - holding on just to 'I' alone.   
In Talks: 253: Bhagavan has said The illiterates are certainly better off than the  
literates whose egos are not destroyed by the quest of the self.   
355: "Illiteracy is ignorance: education is learned ignorance. Both of them  
are ignorant of their true aim; whereas a sage is not ignorant because there  
is no aim for him."   
D.: Mind itself is very subtle and is also the same as the Atman.   
How shall we know the nature of the mind? You have said that all   
supports are useless. What should be our stand then?   
M.: Where does your mind stand?   
D.: Where does it stand?   
M.: Ask the mind itself.   
D.: I ask you now. Should we concentrate on mind then?   
M.: Um!   
D.: But what is the nature of the mind? It is formless. The problem   
is perplexing.   
M.: Why are you perplexed?   
D.: The sastras want us to concentrate and I cannot do so.   
M.: Through what sastras have we known our existence?   
D.: It is a matter of experience. But I want to concentrate.   
M.: Be free from thoughts. Do not hold on to anything. They do not   
hold you. Be yourself.   
D.: I do not yet understand as to where I take my stand and concentrate.   
Can I meditate on my mind?   
M.: Whose mind?   
D.: My own mind?   
M.: Who are you? The question now resolves itself all right.   
(All retired for lunch. The visitor returned at 2-30 p.m. and pursued   
the same question.)   
He said: Maharshi advises the seeker to get rid of thoughts. On what   
should I concentrate the mind after all the thoughts are expelled? I   
do not see where I stand then and on what I should concentrate.   
M.: For whom is the concentration?   
D.: For the mind.   
M.: Then concentrate the mind.   
D.: On what?   
M.: Answer the question yourself. What is the mind? Why should   
you concentrate?   
D.: I do not know what the mind is. I ask Maharshi.   
M.: Maharshi does not seek to know the mind. The questioner must   
question the mind itself as to what it is.   
 **D.: Maharshi advises that the mind should be divested of thoughts.   
M.: This is itself a thought.**   
D.: When all thoughts disappear what remains over?   
M.: Is the mind different from thoughts?   
 **D.: No. The mind is made up of thoughts. My point is this: When all   
thoughts are got rid of, how shall I concentrate the mind?   
M.: Is not this also a thought?**   
D.: Yes, but I am advised to concentrate.   
M.: Why should you concentrate? Why should you not allow your   
thoughts free play?   
D.: The sastras say that the thoughts, thus playing free, lead us astray,   
that is, to unreal and changeful things.   
M.: So then, you want not to be led to unreal and changeful things. Your   
thoughts are unreal and changeful. You want to hold the Reality. That   
is exactly what I say. The thoughts are unreal. Get rid of them.   
 **D.: I understand now. Yet there is a doubt. Not a trice can you remain   
inactive. How shall I be able to rid myself of thoughts?   
M.: The same Gita says: Although all actions take place, I am not the doer.   
It is like the sun towards the world activities. The Self always remains   
actionless, whereas thoughts arise and subside. The Self is Perfection; it   
is immutable; the mind is limited and changeful. You need only to cast   
off your limitations. Your perfection thus stands revealed.**   
D.: Grace is necessary for it.   
 _ **M.: Grace is ever present. All that is necessary is that you surrender to  
It.**_   
D.: I surrender and pray that even if I go wrong I may be forcibly   
drawn to it.   
 **M.: Is this surrender? Surrender to be complete must be   
unquestioning.**   
D.: Yes, I surrender. You say I must dive into the ocean of the Self   
like a pearl-diver into the sea.   
M.: Because you are now thinking that you are out of the ocean of   
Consciousness.   
D.: I practise pranayama. It generates heat in the body. What should   
I do?   
M.: The heat will pass away when the mind gains calm   
D.: That is true but most difficult.   
 **M.: This is again a thought which is an obstacle.

Thought is an obstacle if i am moving in the thought world.   
how can thought obstruct the Self?   
how can a building obstruct the space?   
I am not saying Sri Ramana is wrong.   
i am just saying, the person who recorded it might not have done it all that  
well!

I agree with Udai agru.   
Even Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami also says the same thing.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Mano Nasam means only destruction of  
ignorance in the mind but not destruction of mind.   
If really problems solve by killing our mind then it can be solved by taking  
some injection like anaesthesia. :-)   
So solution is to know that we are not the mind and it is mithya i.e dependent  
on our real naturre i.e sat-chit-ananda.

The point is : mind cannot be killed, coz its never alive to be killed.   
like the snake on a rope. should the snake be killed?   
i am awareness, right now -- there is no choice here.   
and as awareness, i "CANNOT" get sad, happy or anything else. AS AWareness, i  
a Every STillness.   
so its not "Be Still" \-- u R STILLNESS. .. no choice here!   
so when someone says "I WILL BE STILL" thats foolish. As Awareness there is no  
choice. One is STILLNESS ITSELF.   
AS mind, one cannot remain still... coz mind by nature is unreal. mind cannot  
become SAT.   
So, here is the problem. People want the mind to be Still... body to stop  
growing!! how is it ever possible.   
body by its nature has to grow old. mind by its nature has to change. Self  
cannot Change.   
This is the essence.   
Swami Suddhananda gives a nice example: Someone was asked "What is ur age", he  
said "30". "But u said the same thing 10 years ago", asked another who was  
present there. "That is right, i tell the truth and truth cannot change", was  
his reply!   
what kind of truth is that??   
The attempt to stop the mirage like world from appearing is also a mistake.  
coz it shall continue as long as one's prarabdha is there unfinished. no one  
can stop it.   
Love!

The very entity which also says that mind cannot be killed is mind itself.   
In the snake and rope example, snake is an illusion - Mithya and the rope is  
Asat.

Awareness is completely pure. Why is there a need to affirm that I am  
awareness? and to whom is this made?

yes. its mind that is saying.   
and that knowledge "u r awareness" is required for mind only.   
coz, the Self never needs this knowledge. Body cannot have it.   
Its very simple.   
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too?   
is not the instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for  
mind.   
MITHYA and ASAT have one basic difference. Mithya is like a mirage. it appears  
to be present, though its purely ASAT.   
So one cannot stop the appearance. it continues.

Dear I,   
In total agreement with your points, I would like to bring in my views in the  
same example quoted by you: Quote from: srkudai on June 28, 2010, 12:47:37 PM  
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too? is not the instruction "u r not this,  
but that which is outside", its for mind.   
Silence  
when the sage comes on the screen and says u are not this, you are not that  
and etc... and what ever you decide to do: 1 Stop the movie,   
2 continue the movie   
3 follow the sage   
4 not listen the sage   
5 do self enquiry   
6 letting the movie continue by allowing the assitant director to decide on  
the next scenarios believing that it cannot affect me, etc...   
these are still part of the movie itself. These are all the various courses  
the mind has, as options in the movie, as the director. These are "Freewill"  
which the i believes it has, which it can use to do what i wants to.   
Movie is in reality, not there at all, movie exist only for the mind alone  
which is non-self. In ignorance, the character itself, is the one which has  
created the movie and various scenarios and also the sage who comes and says  
you are not this you are that is just another character in the movie created  
by the mind again to make the movie more interesting, thats all.   
Once the character discards his dress knowing its limitedness - means there is  
no more i at all, no director at all, there is no more movie anymore. Movie  
existed only for the mithya i.   
The instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for mind." is  
itself just Mithya as well. It is just a story in the movie, which the i gets  
identified with whereby 'i' mistakenly takes these instruction for itself and  
begins to enquire who am i, I am the Self, I am this and I am that. these are  
all again just illusions. There is no need for self enquiry as well.   
There is no movie at all.   
Appearance is only for the 'i' mind alone. as long as the mind exists  
appearances will continue, as appearances are all the creations of the mind  
alone. Where there are no appearances and where only  
awareness/consciousness/Self alone IS, is real. _Where appearances still are_  
, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Devotees,   
 I would like to share some of my views on various comments by forum members. Members comments are given in bold and my comments are in italics.   
1\. AWA is not Self enquiry since the moment the word watching is used, then  
the   
 subject object relation ship comes into picture and hence it cannot be the state of   
 BEING..Also how can awareness be watched?   
 _  
Comments: Mr. Michael Langford has mentioned that Awareness Watching  
Awareness is Awareness Being Awareness and he also says that because of long  
ancient habit of looking outwards towards people places and things, the word  
watching is used in practice instructions. Also he says that that way we take  
that same habit of watching people, places and things and we shut our eyes and  
turn it inwards. That is why the word watching is used. **Mr.Michael Langford  
says that what is real is awareness watching awareness, looking inward. What  
is unreal is looking outward towards the world of people places and things.  
Hence AWA is in line with Bjhagavans Self Enquiry   
**There are some comments in the forum that how can awareness be watched? If  
the word watching is inappropriate, then a doubt arises in mind how the  
word enquiry is appropriate in Self enquiry. When the word enquiry is used  
then doubt arises about who should enquire and whether self can be enquired  
and if self can be enquired then there must be enquirer similar to watcher in  
the word watching. All these doubts do not arise if tamil word SUMMA IRU is  
used to denote self enquiry**. Bhagavan ramana maharishi has instructed my  
mother around 80 years ago when she was a child that she should read  
Bhagavans works in the same language in which it was originally composed.I  
remember to have read some where that Bhagavan has given similar  
instructions to Annamalai Swami. Bhagavan has composed his great works such  
as   
 Nan Yar, Upadesa Undiar, Ulladhu Naarpathu,Arunachala Akshara mana malai etc  
in Tamil and when it is translated in other languages, it does not convey the  
same meaning as in tamil.. **In this context, I would like members to go  
through the commentary in English on Nan Yar by Mr.Michel James where in he  
uses the same original tamil words in many places in his commentary to  
ensure that the meaning is not distorted.**_   
[/b]   
2.As per AWA, it should be done on certain hours.   
 _Comments:Mr Michael Langford says that spend as many hours per day  
practicing as you can. **If you only practice awareness watching awareness for  
30 minutes per day and spend the other 23 and a half hours looking outward,  
you will not progress very quickly. If you want rapid results, then drop your  
unnecessary activities to free up time so you can practice for many hours per  
day, everyday. Maybe once per week on one of your days off from work you can  
devote the whole day to just practicing awareness watching awareness. Again  
this is in line with Bhagavans teachings that vichara should be done  
throughout the entire waking state   
**_ [/b]   
3.As per AWA, one should practice with eyes closed.   
 _Comments:To a question put to Bhagavan whether eyes should be open or not  
like this Bhagaan answers thus   
A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes it happens that when the eyes are  
closed the latent thoughts rush forth with great vigour. It may also be  
difficult to introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of  
mind to do so. The mind is contaminated when it takes in objects. Otherwise,  
it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind active in its own  
pursuit without taking in external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
 **From the very first sentence in Bhagavan s answer, it is evident that it  
may be done either way.**   
_   
4.As per AWA,ten methods are suggested and how can there be 10 methods since  
there is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being still.   
 _Comments: In Hinduism, four margas(paths) are prescribed for realization  
and devotees can follow any marga to reach the goal of Self realization. In  
Guru Ramana Mr.Cohen, quotes Bhagavan and says that the ultimate goal is  
realize the self and the paths are left to individuals. In fact, Bhagavan has  
told that Bakthi and Jnana are one and the same. In this context, I would like  
to quote an explanation given by late Paramacharya of Kanchi Mutt Sri  
Chandrasekara Saraswathi Swamigal. A devotee had a genuine doubt and asked  
Paramacharya why Paramacharya is confined to pujas and rituals and does not  
perform siddhis(miracles) like Sri. Sathya Sai Baba.. Paramacharya replied  
that the goal of his and Sri.Sathya Sa Baba are one and the same ie to bring  
everybody in to divinity and only difference is that they adopt different  
techniques like marketing people adopt different techniques to sell the goods.   
Bhagvan has given all the spiritual instructions very crystal clear and in  
simple language. In spite of that, during his life time, we can find devotees  
going on questioning about self enquiry again and again and this is evident  
if we go through the bookTalks wherein similar questions on self enquiry  
are repeated at number of places by different devotees. These devotees who put  
questions to hagavan are not ordinary layman but intellectuals and highly  
learned. **In order to cater to needs of people with different caliber,  
Micheal has given different methods and he is not suggested to follow all  
methods. It is left to individuals to follow the method which suits him  
best.This is in line with Bhagavan suggesting two methods ie doing sadhana  
with closed eyes and with open eyes. Which ever suits a devotee, he can follow  
it. Ultimately, the goal is to turn our attention inwards to the subject from  
objects.**   
 **All 10 methods suggested by Mr.Michael boils down to turning the  
attention inwards only and nothing else. Once a devotee becomes proficient in  
practice, he can practice sadhana eyes closed/open, one hour a day to 24  
hours a day,walking/sitting /laying/at rest room/ brushing his teeth. Only  
time he cannot do is while at sleep and when he is actively engaged in any  
work.When he is engaged in any serious activity, he automatically goes into  
meditation since his full attention is on that activity and there no  
thoughts**.   
**To conclude, I am fully convinced by Bhagavans teaching that at some  
point of time, we should forget what we have learned, stop reading books and  
turn our attention inwards. By mere reading various scriptures and endless  
discussion does not lead to realization unless we practice what we have  
learned.. To quote swami Sivananda of Rishikesh, an ounce of practice is  
better than tons of reading. In Sanskrit, it is known as Sravanam, mananam and  
Nithidyasanam and in Tirukkural, Tiruvallur says Karka Kashadara  
Karka.karrapin Nirka Thaga when means read and understand well and then  
practice what you have learnt. Do we[/b_**]?

It is the tendancy of our nature that we complicate things by not only our own  
analysis but also analysis of analyses itself.   
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
These are just tools for 'I' so that it can simply continue in the garb of  
spiritual enquiry and enjoy its existence. It does not at akk matter if  
awareness is watching awareness or awareness is not watching awareness,  
whether Ramana's teachings are same as Michal James or different, whether  
Bhakti yoga is same as Jnana Yoga or different. Whether my point is accepted  
here or rejected. whether the discussions is helping or not.   
'I' \- just hold on to it, everything else is play and only play: Merry-  
Go-Round   
Self Enquiry is like the passive observer. A classic example which Shankara  
Bhagavatpadal has given is that of the bird Dove which lays eggs and carefully  
guards it everyday and accumulates food for it from various places and when  
the eggs are going to hatch, one day the crow comes pushes the eggs down from  
the nest and eats all the eggs and just born dove. The dove, which comes there  
just sees all this without reaction. It just remains.   
Such should be our enquiry.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Here is the classic pic taken from the famous movie Adi Shankaracharya. Its  
one of the best examples as to how our enquiry has to be carried on: Crow and dove.Crow is the doer, the active one.The dove is the passive  
observer, the atman(inner self) - our attention should be always focussed only  
on this.   
instead of focusing our attention on the 'I', if the Dove begins to fight with  
the crow, it is only going to cause damage and loss of peace. Just remaining  
indifferent to what is happening, remaining in the world, carrying out our  
duties, we should remain like the Dove with our attention focused on the Self  
till our Prarabhha karma is dissolved.

Dear Mr.Nagaraj,   
 I agree with your comments as above.When we know that who am I is simply holding on to the "I", why so many posts in this forum on various headings on various topics?. **Bhagavan has given his first teaching "Naan Yar' crystal clear without any room for doubt and still do we require endless discussions on his teachings ?** **It is enough if only Bhagavan 's teachings alone are published in this site as being done by Sri Subramanian and Mr.Prasanth (Both of them are doing great service) and there are sufficient material for them to publish more of Bhagaan's works for many years**.This will help members who have not so far gone thro his books and for the one who has already gone through, it will help to refresh.Few years back, Swami Chinmayananda was invited to a Ramana function and was asked to deliver his talk on Bhagavan Ramana.He did not deliver lecture and instead sat in silence forsome time and at the end told the audience that this is what bhagavan's teaching. **Bhagavan says that Silence is ever speaking and it is interrupted by speaking.Are we following his teachings?

## Re:[34] Is 'Awareness Watching Awareness'-method same as Sri Bhagavan's Self- Attention?

Dear viswanathan   
I agree with your detailed clarfifcations on the points of Michael   
Langford 'Awareness Watching Awareness'. The problems in   
any translation of the original work are that one has to compromise   
with some loss of beauty and cadence. A friend of mine, long time   
back, went to study Russian, to read Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace   
in original. But most of us cannot do that way. Why? Even Tamizhians today  
cannot properly read and understand classical   
Tamizh works like Bhagavan's ULLadu Narpadu. The untranslatatbility of Tamizh  
is quite high. In Tamizh, one often goes even without a verb. Nan Yaar means  
only "I Who" and not   
"Who am I?" Hence many problems have to be confronted by the   
translators. So long as Langford clarifies Watching means Being,   
then, as I already wrote, there is no problem. Even in Sanskrit,   
sometimes the word Darshan means not seeing but being. Siva darshan sometimes  
means Being Siva or Being in Sivam.   
As regards methods, again since every marga leads one ultimately to the one  
marga of self attention, there is no quarrel, in that sense.   
I also refer to Michael James as you have mentioned. He is the guy who read  
and mastered Tamizh while simultaneously venturing understanding and  
practicing Bhagavan Ramana's methods. Hence his books and translations are  
really of a higher order. In his   
Happiness and the Art of Being, he refers to ULLadu Narpadu   
verses and he always gives in italics the Tamizh word or phrases and again and  
again use many ways to describe the purport.   
Arunachala Siva.

OK   
How many of you tried "Awareness Watching Awareness" and found it different  
from Remaining as Self or Self inquiry?   
I tried it, and i see that its just the same. I do not find any difference.  
Whether one says, remain as Awareness within or Be Still, how does it matter?   
Its just the same!

Dear I,   
Quote from: viswanathan on June 28, 2010, 03:16:39 AM  
 I agree with your comments as above.When we know that who am I is simply holding on to the "I", why so many posts in this forum on various headings on various topics?. **Bhagavan has given his first teaching "Naan Yar' crystal clear without any room for doubt and still do we require endless discussions on his teachings ?** **It is enough if only Bhagavan 's teachings alone are published in this site as being done by Sri Subramanian and Mr.Prasanth (Both of them are doing great service) and there are sufficient material for them to publish more of Bhagaan's works for many years**.This will help members who have not so far gone thro his books and for the one who has already gone through, it will help to refresh.Few years back, Swami Chinmayananda was invited to a Ramana function and was asked to deliver his talk on Bhagavan Ramana.He did not deliver lecture and instead sat in silence forsome time and at the end told the audience that this is what bhagavan's teaching. **Bhagavan says that Silence is ever speaking and it is interrupted by speaking.Are we following his teachings?**  
You are absolutely correct. The best course is to simply maintain silence. I  
have always found the tamizh works of Ramana more clearer than any of the  
other languages, it may be because it is my mother tongue, but I did not know  
how to read or write tamizh, but due to Bhagavan's grace, I am learning to  
read and write tamizh now atleast I am able to read it slowly though.   
Personally, I feel, Bhagavan's teachings are to be discussed within the Self  
alone, in the course of enquiry itself and not outside. One has to taste the  
tea himself to know its taste, no matter what elaboration anybody gives, is  
going to be of no avail.   
It is due to the Vasana of finding out answers to our questions that breeds  
questions and endless discussions. Bhagavans says, we need not know any  
answers at all. We fail to recognise the very presence of Bhagavan Ramana, if  
he is not there physically, does it mean that he is not going to clear our  
questions within? its because of this wrong notion, that we begin to discuss  
our issues or questions and it leads to analyses over analyses. What we need  
is a strong belief or Faith or Shraddha that Bhagavan will clear all doubts  
Himself and I need not ask anybody and that He himself will reveal it to me in  
any way, maybe an unknown person would come and say something in some other  
context, or through some incidents. We just need to remain alive and keep the  
enquiry always going. Like how Dhathathreya had 24 Gurus, most of them being  
animals, in a similar way, Bhagavan will bestow on us the clarity in some way  
or the other.   
To ask doubts and discussing it is going outwards. We have to remain within  
our self - holding on just to 'I' alone.   
In Talks: 253: Bhagavan has said The illiterates are certainly better off than the  
literates whose egos are not destroyed by the quest of the self.   
355: "Illiteracy is ignorance: education is learned ignorance. Both of them  
are ignorant of their true aim; whereas a sage is not ignorant because there  
is no aim for him."   
D.: Mind itself is very subtle and is also the same as the Atman.   
How shall we know the nature of the mind? You have said that all   
supports are useless. What should be our stand then?   
M.: Where does your mind stand?   
D.: Where does it stand?   
M.: Ask the mind itself.   
D.: I ask you now. Should we concentrate on mind then?   
M.: Um!   
D.: But what is the nature of the mind? It is formless. The problem   
is perplexing.   
M.: Why are you perplexed?   
D.: The sastras want us to concentrate and I cannot do so.   
M.: Through what sastras have we known our existence?   
D.: It is a matter of experience. But I want to concentrate.   
M.: Be free from thoughts. Do not hold on to anything. They do not   
hold you. Be yourself.   
D.: I do not yet understand as to where I take my stand and concentrate.   
Can I meditate on my mind?   
M.: Whose mind?   
D.: My own mind?   
M.: Who are you? The question now resolves itself all right.   
(All retired for lunch. The visitor returned at 2-30 p.m. and pursued   
the same question.)   
He said: Maharshi advises the seeker to get rid of thoughts. On what   
should I concentrate the mind after all the thoughts are expelled? I   
do not see where I stand then and on what I should concentrate.   
M.: For whom is the concentration?   
D.: For the mind.   
M.: Then concentrate the mind.   
D.: On what?   
M.: Answer the question yourself. What is the mind? Why should   
you concentrate?   
D.: I do not know what the mind is. I ask Maharshi.   
M.: Maharshi does not seek to know the mind. The questioner must   
question the mind itself as to what it is.   
 **D.: Maharshi advises that the mind should be divested of thoughts.   
M.: This is itself a thought.**   
D.: When all thoughts disappear what remains over?   
M.: Is the mind different from thoughts?   
 **D.: No. The mind is made up of thoughts. My point is this: When all   
thoughts are got rid of, how shall I concentrate the mind?   
M.: Is not this also a thought?**   
D.: Yes, but I am advised to concentrate.   
M.: Why should you concentrate? Why should you not allow your   
thoughts free play?   
D.: The sastras say that the thoughts, thus playing free, lead us astray,   
that is, to unreal and changeful things.   
M.: So then, you want not to be led to unreal and changeful things. Your   
thoughts are unreal and changeful. You want to hold the Reality. That   
is exactly what I say. The thoughts are unreal. Get rid of them.   
 **D.: I understand now. Yet there is a doubt. Not a trice can you remain   
inactive. How shall I be able to rid myself of thoughts?   
M.: The same Gita says: Although all actions take place, I am not the doer.   
It is like the sun towards the world activities. The Self always remains   
actionless, whereas thoughts arise and subside. The Self is Perfection; it   
is immutable; the mind is limited and changeful. You need only to cast   
off your limitations. Your perfection thus stands revealed.**   
D.: Grace is necessary for it.   
 _ **M.: Grace is ever present. All that is necessary is that you surrender to  
It.**_   
D.: I surrender and pray that even if I go wrong I may be forcibly   
drawn to it.   
 **M.: Is this surrender? Surrender to be complete must be   
unquestioning.**   
D.: Yes, I surrender. You say I must dive into the ocean of the Self   
like a pearl-diver into the sea.   
M.: Because you are now thinking that you are out of the ocean of   
Consciousness.   
D.: I practise pranayama. It generates heat in the body. What should   
I do?   
M.: The heat will pass away when the mind gains calm   
D.: That is true but most difficult.   
 **M.: This is again a thought which is an obstacle.

Even Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami also says the same thing.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Mano Nasam means only destruction of  
ignorance in the mind but not destruction of mind.   
If really problems solve by killing our mind then it can be solved by taking  
some injection like anaesthesia. :-)   
So solution is to know that we are not the mind and it is mithya i.e dependent  
on our real naturre i.e sat-chit-ananda.

Dear I,   
I would rather put it this way: When the glass tumbler is half filled with water. One says its half filled and  
the other says its half empty.   
Thats all is the difference.

The point is : mind cannot be killed, coz its never alive to be killed.   
like the snake on a rope. should the snake be killed?   
i am awareness, right now -- there is no choice here.   
and as awareness, i "CANNOT" get sad, happy or anything else. AS AWareness, i  
a Every STillness.   
so its not "Be Still" \-- u R STILLNESS. .. no choice here!   
so when someone says "I WILL BE STILL" thats foolish. As Awareness there is no  
choice. One is STILLNESS ITSELF.   
AS mind, one cannot remain still... coz mind by nature is unreal. mind cannot  
become SAT.   
So, here is the problem. People want the mind to be Still... body to stop  
growing!! how is it ever possible.   
body by its nature has to grow old. mind by its nature has to change. Self  
cannot Change.   
This is the essence.   
Swami Suddhananda gives a nice example: Someone was asked "What is ur age", he  
said "30". "But u said the same thing 10 years ago", asked another who was  
present there. "That is right, i tell the truth and truth cannot change", was  
his reply!   
what kind of truth is that??   
The attempt to stop the mirage like world from appearing is also a mistake.  
coz it shall continue as long as one's prarabdha is there unfinished. no one  
can stop it.   
Love!   
Silence

The very entity which also says that mind cannot be killed is mind itself.   
In the snake and rope example, snake is an illusion - Mithya and the rope is  
Asat.

Awareness is completely pure. Why is there a need to affirm that I am  
awareness? and to whom is this made?

yes. its mind that is saying.   
and that knowledge "u r awareness" is required for mind only.   
coz, the Self never needs this knowledge. Body cannot have it.   
Its very simple.   
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too?   
is not the instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for  
mind.   
MITHYA and ASAT have one basic difference. Mithya is like a mirage. it appears  
to be present, though its purely ASAT.   
So one cannot stop the appearance. it continues.

Dear I,   
In total agreement with your points, I would like to bring in my views in the  
same example quoted by you: Quote from: srkudai on June 28, 2010, 12:47:37 PM  
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too? is not the instruction "u r not this,  
but that which is outside", its for mind.   
Silence  
when the sage comes on the screen and says u are not this, you are not that  
and etc... and what ever you decide to do: 1 Stop the movie,   
2 continue the movie   
3 follow the sage   
4 not listen the sage   
5 do self enquiry   
6 letting the movie continue by allowing the assitant director to decide on  
the next scenarios believing that it cannot affect me, etc...   
these are still part of the movie itself. These are all the various courses  
the mind has, as options in the movie, as the director. These are "Freewill"  
which the i believes it has, which it can use to do what i wants to.   
Movie is in reality, not there at all, movie exist only for the mind alone  
which is non-self. In ignorance, the character itself, is the one which has  
created the movie and various scenarios and also the sage who comes and says  
you are not this you are that is just another character in the movie created  
by the mind again to make the movie more interesting, thats all.   
Once the character discards his dress knowing its limitedness - means there is  
no more i at all, no director at all, there is no more movie anymore. Movie  
existed only for the mithya i.   
The instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for mind." is  
itself just Mithya as well. It is just a story in the movie, which the i gets  
identified with whereby 'i' mistakenly takes these instruction for itself and  
begins to enquire who am i, I am the Self, I am this and I am that. these are  
all again just illusions. There is no need for self enquiry as well.   
There is no movie at all.   
Appearance is only for the 'i' mind alone. as long as the mind exists  
appearances will continue, as appearances are all the creations of the mind  
alone. Where there are no appearances and where only  
awareness/consciousness/Self alone IS, is real. _Where appearances still are_  
, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.

## Re:[30] Is 'Awareness Watching Awareness'-method same as Sri Bhagavan's Self- Attention?

Dear Devotees,   
 I would like to share some of my views on various comments by forum members. Members comments are given in bold and my comments are in italics.   
1\. AWA is not Self enquiry since the moment the word watching is used, then  
the   
 subject object relation ship comes into picture and hence it cannot be the state of   
 BEING..Also how can awareness be watched?   
 _  
Comments: Mr. Michael Langford has mentioned that Awareness Watching  
Awareness is Awareness Being Awareness and he also says that because of long  
ancient habit of looking outwards towards people places and things, the word  
watching is used in practice instructions. Also he says that that way we take  
that same habit of watching people, places and things and we shut our eyes and  
turn it inwards. That is why the word watching is used. **Mr.Michael Langford  
says that what is real is awareness watching awareness, looking inward. What  
is unreal is looking outward towards the world of people places and things.  
Hence AWA is in line with Bjhagavans Self Enquiry   
**There are some comments in the forum that how can awareness be watched? If  
the word watching is inappropriate, then a doubt arises in mind how the  
word enquiry is appropriate in Self enquiry. When the word enquiry is used  
then doubt arises about who should enquire and whether self can be enquired  
and if self can be enquired then there must be enquirer similar to watcher in  
the word watching. All these doubts do not arise if tamil word SUMMA IRU is  
used to denote self enquiry**. Bhagavan ramana maharishi has instructed my  
mother around 80 years ago when she was a child that she should read  
Bhagavans works in the same language in which it was originally composed.I  
remember to have read some where that Bhagavan has given similar  
instructions to Annamalai Swami. Bhagavan has composed his great works such  
as   
 Nan Yar, Upadesa Undiar, Ulladhu Naarpathu,Arunachala Akshara mana malai etc  
in Tamil and when it is translated in other languages, it does not convey the  
same meaning as in tamil.. **In this context, I would like members to go  
through the commentary in English on Nan Yar by Mr.Michel James where in he  
uses the same original tamil words in many places in his commentary to  
ensure that the meaning is not distorted.**_   
[/b]   
2.As per AWA, it should be done on certain hours.   
 _Comments:Mr Michael Langford says that spend as many hours per day  
practicing as you can. **If you only practice awareness watching awareness for  
30 minutes per day and spend the other 23 and a half hours looking outward,  
you will not progress very quickly. If you want rapid results, then drop your  
unnecessary activities to free up time so you can practice for many hours per  
day, everyday. Maybe once per week on one of your days off from work you can  
devote the whole day to just practicing awareness watching awareness. Again  
this is in line with Bhagavans teachings that vichara should be done  
throughout the entire waking state   
**_ [/b]   
3.As per AWA, one should practice with eyes closed.   
 _Comments:To a question put to Bhagavan whether eyes should be open or not  
like this Bhagaan answers thus   
A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes it happens that when the eyes are  
closed the latent thoughts rush forth with great vigour. It may also be  
difficult to introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of  
mind to do so. The mind is contaminated when it takes in objects. Otherwise,  
it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind active in its own  
pursuit without taking in external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
 **From the very first sentence in Bhagavan s answer, it is evident that it  
may be done either way.**   
_   
4.As per AWA,ten methods are suggested and how can there be 10 methods since  
there is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being still.   
 _Comments: In Hinduism, four margas(paths) are prescribed for realization  
and devotees can follow any marga to reach the goal of Self realization. In  
Guru Ramana Mr.Cohen, quotes Bhagavan and says that the ultimate goal is  
realize the self and the paths are left to individuals. In fact, Bhagavan has  
told that Bakthi and Jnana are one and the same. In this context, I would like  
to quote an explanation given by late Paramacharya of Kanchi Mutt Sri  
Chandrasekara Saraswathi Swamigal. A devotee had a genuine doubt and asked  
Paramacharya why Paramacharya is confined to pujas and rituals and does not  
perform siddhis(miracles) like Sri. Sathya Sai Baba.. Paramacharya replied  
that the goal of his and Sri.Sathya Sa Baba are one and the same ie to bring  
everybody in to divinity and only difference is that they adopt different  
techniques like marketing people adopt different techniques to sell the goods.   
Bhagvan has given all the spiritual instructions very crystal clear and in  
simple language. In spite of that, during his life time, we can find devotees  
going on questioning about self enquiry again and again and this is evident  
if we go through the bookTalks wherein similar questions on self enquiry  
are repeated at number of places by different devotees. These devotees who put  
questions to hagavan are not ordinary layman but intellectuals and highly  
learned. **In order to cater to needs of people with different caliber,  
Micheal has given different methods and he is not suggested to follow all  
methods. It is left to individuals to follow the method which suits him  
best.This is in line with Bhagavan suggesting two methods ie doing sadhana  
with closed eyes and with open eyes. Which ever suits a devotee, he can follow  
it. Ultimately, the goal is to turn our attention inwards to the subject from  
objects.**   
 **All 10 methods suggested by Mr.Michael boils down to turning the  
attention inwards only and nothing else. Once a devotee becomes proficient in  
practice, he can practice sadhana eyes closed/open, one hour a day to 24  
hours a day,walking/sitting /laying/at rest room/ brushing his teeth. Only  
time he cannot do is while at sleep and when he is actively engaged in any  
work.When he is engaged in any serious activity, he automatically goes into  
meditation since his full attention is on that activity and there no  
thoughts**.   
**To conclude, I am fully convinced by Bhagavans teaching that at some  
point of time, we should forget what we have learned, stop reading books and  
turn our attention inwards. By mere reading various scriptures and endless  
discussion does not lead to realization unless we practice what we have  
learned.. To quote swami Sivananda of Rishikesh, an ounce of practice is  
better than tons of reading. In Sanskrit, it is known as Sravanam, mananam and  
Nithidyasanam and in Tirukkural, Tiruvallur says Karka Kashadara  
Karka.karrapin Nirka Thaga when means read and understand well and then  
practice what you have learnt. Do we[/b_**]?

It is the tendancy of our nature that we complicate things by not only our own  
analysis but also analysis of analyses itself.   
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
These are just tools for 'I' so that it can simply continue in the garb of  
spiritual enquiry and enjoy its existence. It does not at akk matter if  
awareness is watching awareness or awareness is not watching awareness,  
whether Ramana's teachings are same as Michal James or different, whether  
Bhakti yoga is same as Jnana Yoga or different. Whether my point is accepted  
here or rejected. whether the discussions is helping or not.   
'I' \- just hold on to it, everything else is play and only play: Merry-  
Go-Round   
Self Enquiry is like the passive observer. A classic example which Shankara  
Bhagavatpadal has given is that of the bird Dove which lays eggs and carefully  
guards it everyday and accumulates food for it from various places and when  
the eggs are going to hatch, one day the crow comes pushes the eggs down from  
the nest and eats all the eggs and just born dove. The dove, which comes there  
just sees all this without reaction. It just remains.   
Such should be our enquiry.

Here is the classic pic taken from the famous movie Adi Shankaracharya. Its  
one of the best examples as to how our enquiry has to be carried on: Crow and dove.Crow is the doer, the active one.The dove is the passive  
observer, the atman(inner self) - our attention should be always focussed only  
on this.   
instead of focusing our attention on the 'I', if the Dove begins to fight with  
the crow, it is only going to cause damage and loss of peace. Just remaining  
indifferent to what is happening, remaining in the world, carrying out our  
duties, we should remain like the Dove with our attention focused on the Self  
till our Prarabhha karma is dissolved.

Dear Mr.Nagaraj,   
 I agree with your comments as above.When we know that who am I is simply holding on to the "I", why so many posts in this forum on various headings on various topics?. **Bhagavan has given his first teaching "Naan Yar' crystal clear without any room for doubt and still do we require endless discussions on his teachings ?** **It is enough if only Bhagavan 's teachings alone are published in this site as being done by Sri Subramanian and Mr.Prasanth (Both of them are doing great service) and there are sufficient material for them to publish more of Bhagaan's works for many years**.This will help members who have not so far gone thro his books and for the one who has already gone through, it will help to refresh.Few years back, Swami Chinmayananda was invited to a Ramana function and was asked to deliver his talk on Bhagavan Ramana.He did not deliver lecture and instead sat in silence forsome time and at the end told the audience that this is what bhagavan's teaching. **Bhagavan says that Silence is ever speaking and it is interrupted by speaking.Are we following his teachings?

Dear viswanathan   
I agree with your detailed clarfifcations on the points of Michael   
Langford 'Awareness Watching Awareness'. The problems in   
any translation of the original work are that one has to compromise   
with some loss of beauty and cadence. A friend of mine, long time   
back, went to study Russian, to read Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace   
in original. But most of us cannot do that way. Why? Even Tamizhians today  
cannot properly read and understand classical   
Tamizh works like Bhagavan's ULLadu Narpadu. The untranslatatbility of Tamizh  
is quite high. In Tamizh, one often goes even without a verb. Nan Yaar means  
only "I Who" and not   
"Who am I?" Hence many problems have to be confronted by the   
translators. So long as Langford clarifies Watching means Being,   
then, as I already wrote, there is no problem. Even in Sanskrit,   
sometimes the word Darshan means not seeing but being. Siva darshan sometimes  
means Being Siva or Being in Sivam.   
As regards methods, again since every marga leads one ultimately to the one  
marga of self attention, there is no quarrel, in that sense.   
I also refer to Michael James as you have mentioned. He is the guy who read  
and mastered Tamizh while simultaneously venturing understanding and  
practicing Bhagavan Ramana's methods. Hence his books and translations are  
really of a higher order. In his   
Happiness and the Art of Being, he refers to ULLadu Narpadu   
verses and he always gives in italics the Tamizh word or phrases and again and  
again use many ways to describe the purport.   
Arunachala Siva.

OK   
How many of you tried "Awareness Watching Awareness" and found it different  
from Remaining as Self or Self inquiry?   
I tried it, and i see that its just the same. I do not find any difference.  
Whether one says, remain as Awareness within or Be Still, how does it matter?   
Its just the same!

Dear I,   
Quote from: viswanathan on June 28, 2010, 03:16:39 AM  
 I agree with your comments as above.When we know that who am I is simply holding on to the "I", why so many posts in this forum on various headings on various topics?. **Bhagavan has given his first teaching "Naan Yar' crystal clear without any room for doubt and still do we require endless discussions on his teachings ?** **It is enough if only Bhagavan 's teachings alone are published in this site as being done by Sri Subramanian and Mr.Prasanth (Both of them are doing great service) and there are sufficient material for them to publish more of Bhagaan's works for many years**.This will help members who have not so far gone thro his books and for the one who has already gone through, it will help to refresh.Few years back, Swami Chinmayananda was invited to a Ramana function and was asked to deliver his talk on Bhagavan Ramana.He did not deliver lecture and instead sat in silence forsome time and at the end told the audience that this is what bhagavan's teaching. **Bhagavan says that Silence is ever speaking and it is interrupted by speaking.Are we following his teachings?**  
You are absolutely correct. The best course is to simply maintain silence. I  
have always found the tamizh works of Ramana more clearer than any of the  
other languages, it may be because it is my mother tongue, but I did not know  
how to read or write tamizh, but due to Bhagavan's grace, I am learning to  
read and write tamizh now atleast I am able to read it slowly though.   
Personally, I feel, Bhagavan's teachings are to be discussed within the Self  
alone, in the course of enquiry itself and not outside. One has to taste the  
tea himself to know its taste, no matter what elaboration anybody gives, is  
going to be of no avail.   
It is due to the Vasana of finding out answers to our questions that breeds  
questions and endless discussions. Bhagavans says, we need not know any  
answers at all. We fail to recognise the very presence of Bhagavan Ramana, if  
he is not there physically, does it mean that he is not going to clear our  
questions within? its because of this wrong notion, that we begin to discuss  
our issues or questions and it leads to analyses over analyses. What we need  
is a strong belief or Faith or Shraddha that Bhagavan will clear all doubts  
Himself and I need not ask anybody and that He himself will reveal it to me in  
any way, maybe an unknown person would come and say something in some other  
context, or through some incidents. We just need to remain alive and keep the  
enquiry always going. Like how Dhathathreya had 24 Gurus, most of them being  
animals, in a similar way, Bhagavan will bestow on us the clarity in some way  
or the other.   
To ask doubts and discussing it is going outwards. We have to remain within  
our self - holding on just to 'I' alone.   
In Talks: 253: Bhagavan has said The illiterates are certainly better off than the  
literates whose egos are not destroyed by the quest of the self.   
355: "Illiteracy is ignorance: education is learned ignorance. Both of them  
are ignorant of their true aim; whereas a sage is not ignorant because there  
is no aim for him."   
D.: Mind itself is very subtle and is also the same as the Atman.   
How shall we know the nature of the mind? You have said that all   
supports are useless. What should be our stand then?   
M.: Where does your mind stand?   
D.: Where does it stand?   
M.: Ask the mind itself.   
D.: I ask you now. Should we concentrate on mind then?   
M.: Um!   
D.: But what is the nature of the mind? It is formless. The problem   
is perplexing.   
M.: Why are you perplexed?   
D.: The sastras want us to concentrate and I cannot do so.   
M.: Through what sastras have we known our existence?   
D.: It is a matter of experience. But I want to concentrate.   
M.: Be free from thoughts. Do not hold on to anything. They do not   
hold you. Be yourself.   
D.: I do not yet understand as to where I take my stand and concentrate.   
Can I meditate on my mind?   
M.: Whose mind?   
D.: My own mind?   
M.: Who are you? The question now resolves itself all right.   
(All retired for lunch. The visitor returned at 2-30 p.m. and pursued   
the same question.)   
He said: Maharshi advises the seeker to get rid of thoughts. On what   
should I concentrate the mind after all the thoughts are expelled? I   
do not see where I stand then and on what I should concentrate.   
M.: For whom is the concentration?   
D.: For the mind.   
M.: Then concentrate the mind.   
D.: On what?   
M.: Answer the question yourself. What is the mind? Why should   
you concentrate?   
D.: I do not know what the mind is. I ask Maharshi.   
M.: Maharshi does not seek to know the mind. The questioner must   
question the mind itself as to what it is.   
 **D.: Maharshi advises that the mind should be divested of thoughts.   
M.: This is itself a thought.**   
D.: When all thoughts disappear what remains over?   
M.: Is the mind different from thoughts?   
 **D.: No. The mind is made up of thoughts. My point is this: When all   
thoughts are got rid of, how shall I concentrate the mind?   
M.: Is not this also a thought?**   
D.: Yes, but I am advised to concentrate.   
M.: Why should you concentrate? Why should you not allow your   
thoughts free play?   
D.: The sastras say that the thoughts, thus playing free, lead us astray,   
that is, to unreal and changeful things.   
M.: So then, you want not to be led to unreal and changeful things. Your   
thoughts are unreal and changeful. You want to hold the Reality. That   
is exactly what I say. The thoughts are unreal. Get rid of them.   
 **D.: I understand now. Yet there is a doubt. Not a trice can you remain   
inactive. How shall I be able to rid myself of thoughts?   
M.: The same Gita says: Although all actions take place, I am not the doer.   
It is like the sun towards the world activities. The Self always remains   
actionless, whereas thoughts arise and subside. The Self is Perfection; it   
is immutable; the mind is limited and changeful. You need only to cast   
off your limitations. Your perfection thus stands revealed.**   
D.: Grace is necessary for it.   
 _ **M.: Grace is ever present. All that is necessary is that you surrender to  
It.**_   
D.: I surrender and pray that even if I go wrong I may be forcibly   
drawn to it.   
 **M.: Is this surrender? Surrender to be complete must be   
unquestioning.**   
D.: Yes, I surrender. You say I must dive into the ocean of the Self   
like a pearl-diver into the sea.   
M.: Because you are now thinking that you are out of the ocean of   
Consciousness.   
D.: I practise pranayama. It generates heat in the body. What should   
I do?   
M.: The heat will pass away when the mind gains calm   
D.: That is true but most difficult.   
 **M.: This is again a thought which is an obstacle.

Thought is an obstacle if i am moving in the thought world.   
how can thought obstruct the Self?   
how can a building obstruct the space?   
I am not saying Sri Ramana is wrong.   
i am just saying, the person who recorded it might not have done it all that  
well!

I agree with Udai agru.   
Even Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami also says the same thing.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Mano Nasam means only destruction of  
ignorance in the mind but not destruction of mind.   
If really problems solve by killing our mind then it can be solved by taking  
some injection like anaesthesia. :-)   
So solution is to know that we are not the mind and it is mithya i.e dependent  
on our real naturre i.e sat-chit-ananda.

Dear I,   
I would rather put it this way: When the glass tumbler is half filled with water. One says its half filled and  
the other says its half empty.   
Thats all is the difference.

The point is : mind cannot be killed, coz its never alive to be killed.   
like the snake on a rope. should the snake be killed?   
i am awareness, right now -- there is no choice here.   
and as awareness, i "CANNOT" get sad, happy or anything else. AS AWareness, i  
a Every STillness.   
so its not "Be Still" \-- u R STILLNESS. .. no choice here!   
so when someone says "I WILL BE STILL" thats foolish. As Awareness there is no  
choice. One is STILLNESS ITSELF.   
AS mind, one cannot remain still... coz mind by nature is unreal. mind cannot  
become SAT.   
So, here is the problem. People want the mind to be Still... body to stop  
growing!! how is it ever possible.   
body by its nature has to grow old. mind by its nature has to change. Self  
cannot Change.   
This is the essence.   
Swami Suddhananda gives a nice example: Someone was asked "What is ur age", he  
said "30". "But u said the same thing 10 years ago", asked another who was  
present there. "That is right, i tell the truth and truth cannot change", was  
his reply!   
what kind of truth is that??   
The attempt to stop the mirage like world from appearing is also a mistake.  
coz it shall continue as long as one's prarabdha is there unfinished. no one  
can stop it.   
Love!   
Silence

The very entity which also says that mind cannot be killed is mind itself.   
In the snake and rope example, snake is an illusion - Mithya and the rope is  
Asat.

Awareness is completely pure. Why is there a need to affirm that I am  
awareness? and to whom is this made?

yes. its mind that is saying.   
and that knowledge "u r awareness" is required for mind only.   
coz, the Self never needs this knowledge. Body cannot have it.   
Its very simple.   
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too?   
is not the instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for  
mind.   
MITHYA and ASAT have one basic difference. Mithya is like a mirage. it appears  
to be present, though its purely ASAT.   
So one cannot stop the appearance. it continues.

Dear I,   
In total agreement with your points, I would like to bring in my views in the  
same example quoted by you: Quote from: srkudai on June 28, 2010, 12:47:37 PM  
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too? is not the instruction "u r not this,  
but that which is outside", its for mind.   
Silence  
when the sage comes on the screen and says u are not this, you are not that  
and etc... and what ever you decide to do: 1 Stop the movie,   
2 continue the movie   
3 follow the sage   
4 not listen the sage   
5 do self enquiry   
6 letting the movie continue by allowing the assitant director to decide on  
the next scenarios believing that it cannot affect me, etc...   
these are still part of the movie itself. These are all the various courses  
the mind has, as options in the movie, as the director. These are "Freewill"  
which the i believes it has, which it can use to do what i wants to.   
Movie is in reality, not there at all, movie exist only for the mind alone  
which is non-self. In ignorance, the character itself, is the one which has  
created the movie and various scenarios and also the sage who comes and says  
you are not this you are that is just another character in the movie created  
by the mind again to make the movie more interesting, thats all.   
Once the character discards his dress knowing its limitedness - means there is  
no more i at all, no director at all, there is no more movie anymore. Movie  
existed only for the mithya i.   
The instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for mind." is  
itself just Mithya as well. It is just a story in the movie, which the i gets  
identified with whereby 'i' mistakenly takes these instruction for itself and  
begins to enquire who am i, I am the Self, I am this and I am that. these are  
all again just illusions. There is no need for self enquiry as well.   
There is no movie at all.   
Appearance is only for the 'i' mind alone. as long as the mind exists  
appearances will continue, as appearances are all the creations of the mind  
alone. Where there are no appearances and where only  
awareness/consciousness/Self alone IS, is real. _Where appearances still are_  
, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.

Dear Devotees,   
 I would like to share some of my views on various comments by forum members. Members comments are given in bold and my comments are in italics.   
1\. AWA is not Self enquiry since the moment the word watching is used, then  
the   
 subject object relation ship comes into picture and hence it cannot be the state of   
 BEING..Also how can awareness be watched?   
 _  
Comments: Mr. Michael Langford has mentioned that Awareness Watching  
Awareness is Awareness Being Awareness and he also says that because of long  
ancient habit of looking outwards towards people places and things, the word  
watching is used in practice instructions. Also he says that that way we take  
that same habit of watching people, places and things and we shut our eyes and  
turn it inwards. That is why the word watching is used. **Mr.Michael Langford  
says that what is real is awareness watching awareness, looking inward. What  
is unreal is looking outward towards the world of people places and things.  
Hence AWA is in line with Bjhagavans Self Enquiry   
**There are some comments in the forum that how can awareness be watched? If  
the word watching is inappropriate, then a doubt arises in mind how the  
word enquiry is appropriate in Self enquiry. When the word enquiry is used  
then doubt arises about who should enquire and whether self can be enquired  
and if self can be enquired then there must be enquirer similar to watcher in  
the word watching. All these doubts do not arise if tamil word SUMMA IRU is  
used to denote self enquiry**. Bhagavan ramana maharishi has instructed my  
mother around 80 years ago when she was a child that she should read  
Bhagavans works in the same language in which it was originally composed.I  
remember to have read some where that Bhagavan has given similar  
instructions to Annamalai Swami. Bhagavan has composed his great works such  
as   
 Nan Yar, Upadesa Undiar, Ulladhu Naarpathu,Arunachala Akshara mana malai etc  
in Tamil and when it is translated in other languages, it does not convey the  
same meaning as in tamil.. **In this context, I would like members to go  
through the commentary in English on Nan Yar by Mr.Michel James where in he  
uses the same original tamil words in many places in his commentary to  
ensure that the meaning is not distorted.**_   
[/b]   
2.As per AWA, it should be done on certain hours.   
 _Comments:Mr Michael Langford says that spend as many hours per day  
practicing as you can. **If you only practice awareness watching awareness for  
30 minutes per day and spend the other 23 and a half hours looking outward,  
you will not progress very quickly. If you want rapid results, then drop your  
unnecessary activities to free up time so you can practice for many hours per  
day, everyday. Maybe once per week on one of your days off from work you can  
devote the whole day to just practicing awareness watching awareness. Again  
this is in line with Bhagavans teachings that vichara should be done  
throughout the entire waking state   
**_ [/b]   
3.As per AWA, one should practice with eyes closed.   
 _Comments:To a question put to Bhagavan whether eyes should be open or not  
like this Bhagaan answers thus   
A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes it happens that when the eyes are  
closed the latent thoughts rush forth with great vigour. It may also be  
difficult to introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of  
mind to do so. The mind is contaminated when it takes in objects. Otherwise,  
it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind active in its own  
pursuit without taking in external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
 **From the very first sentence in Bhagavan s answer, it is evident that it  
may be done either way.**   
_   
4.As per AWA,ten methods are suggested and how can there be 10 methods since  
there is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being still.   
 _Comments: In Hinduism, four margas(paths) are prescribed for realization  
and devotees can follow any marga to reach the goal of Self realization. In  
Guru Ramana Mr.Cohen, quotes Bhagavan and says that the ultimate goal is  
realize the self and the paths are left to individuals. In fact, Bhagavan has  
told that Bakthi and Jnana are one and the same. In this context, I would like  
to quote an explanation given by late Paramacharya of Kanchi Mutt Sri  
Chandrasekara Saraswathi Swamigal. A devotee had a genuine doubt and asked  
Paramacharya why Paramacharya is confined to pujas and rituals and does not  
perform siddhis(miracles) like Sri. Sathya Sai Baba.. Paramacharya replied  
that the goal of his and Sri.Sathya Sa Baba are one and the same ie to bring  
everybody in to divinity and only difference is that they adopt different  
techniques like marketing people adopt different techniques to sell the goods.   
Bhagvan has given all the spiritual instructions very crystal clear and in  
simple language. In spite of that, during his life time, we can find devotees  
going on questioning about self enquiry again and again and this is evident  
if we go through the bookTalks wherein similar questions on self enquiry  
are repeated at number of places by different devotees. These devotees who put  
questions to hagavan are not ordinary layman but intellectuals and highly  
learned. **In order to cater to needs of people with different caliber,  
Micheal has given different methods and he is not suggested to follow all  
methods. It is left to individuals to follow the method which suits him  
best.This is in line with Bhagavan suggesting two methods ie doing sadhana  
with closed eyes and with open eyes. Which ever suits a devotee, he can follow  
it. Ultimately, the goal is to turn our attention inwards to the subject from  
objects.**   
 **All 10 methods suggested by Mr.Michael boils down to turning the  
attention inwards only and nothing else. Once a devotee becomes proficient in  
practice, he can practice sadhana eyes closed/open, one hour a day to 24  
hours a day,walking/sitting /laying/at rest room/ brushing his teeth. Only  
time he cannot do is while at sleep and when he is actively engaged in any  
work.When he is engaged in any serious activity, he automatically goes into  
meditation since his full attention is on that activity and there no  
thoughts**.   
**To conclude, I am fully convinced by Bhagavans teaching that at some  
point of time, we should forget what we have learned, stop reading books and  
turn our attention inwards. By mere reading various scriptures and endless  
discussion does not lead to realization unless we practice what we have  
learned.. To quote swami Sivananda of Rishikesh, an ounce of practice is  
better than tons of reading. In Sanskrit, it is known as Sravanam, mananam and

It is the tendancy of our nature that we complicate things by not only our own  
analysis but also analysis of analyses itself.   
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
These are just tools for 'I' so that it can simply continue in the garb of  
spiritual enquiry and enjoy its existence. It does not at akk matter if  
awareness is watching awareness or awareness is not watching awareness,  
whether Ramana's teachings are same as Michal James or different, whether  
Bhakti yoga is same as Jnana Yoga or different. Whether my point is accepted  
here or rejected. whether the discussions is helping or not.   
'I' \- just hold on to it, everything else is play and only play: Merry-  
Go-Round   
Self Enquiry is like the passive observer. A classic example which Shankara  
Bhagavatpadal has given is that of the bird Dove which lays eggs and carefully  
guards it everyday and accumulates food for it from various places and when  
the eggs are going to hatch, one day the crow comes pushes the eggs down from  
the nest and eats all the eggs and just born dove. The dove, which comes there  
just sees all this without reaction. It just remains.   
Such should be our enquiry.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Here is the classic pic taken from the famous movie Adi Shankaracharya. Its  
one of the best examples as to how our enquiry has to be carried on: Crow and dove.Crow is the doer, the active one.The dove is the passive  
observer, the atman(inner self) - our attention should be always focussed only  
on this.   
instead of focusing our attention on the 'I', if the Dove begins to fight with  
the crow, it is only going to cause damage and loss of peace. Just remaining  
indifferent to what is happening, remaining in the world, carrying out our  
duties, we should remain like the Dove with our attention focused on the Self  
till our Prarabhha karma is dissolved.

Dear Mr.Nagaraj,   
 I agree with your comments as above.When we know that who am I is simply holding on to the "I", why so many posts in this forum on various headings on various topics?. **Bhagavan has given his first teaching "Naan Yar' crystal clear without any room for doubt and still do we require endless discussions on his teachings ?** **It is enough if only Bhagavan 's teachings alone are published in this site as being done by Sri Subramanian and Mr.Prasanth (Both of them are doing great service) and there are sufficient material for them to publish more of Bhagaan's works for many years**.This will help members who have not so far gone thro his books and for the one who has already gone through, it will help to refresh.Few years back, Swami Chinmayananda was invited to a Ramana function and was asked to deliver his talk on Bhagavan Ramana.He did not deliver lecture and instead sat in silence forsome time and at the end told the audience that this is what bhagavan's teaching. **Bhagavan says that Silence is ever speaking and it is interrupted by speaking.Are we following his teachings?

Dear viswanathan   
I agree with your detailed clarfifcations on the points of Michael   
Langford 'Awareness Watching Awareness'. The problems in   
any translation of the original work are that one has to compromise   
with some loss of beauty and cadence. A friend of mine, long time   
back, went to study Russian, to read Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace   
in original. But most of us cannot do that way. Why? Even Tamizhians today  
cannot properly read and understand classical   
Tamizh works like Bhagavan's ULLadu Narpadu. The untranslatatbility of Tamizh  
is quite high. In Tamizh, one often goes even without a verb. Nan Yaar means  
only "I Who" and not   
"Who am I?" Hence many problems have to be confronted by the   
translators. So long as Langford clarifies Watching means Being,   
then, as I already wrote, there is no problem. Even in Sanskrit,   
sometimes the word Darshan means not seeing but being. Siva darshan sometimes  
means Being Siva or Being in Sivam.   
As regards methods, again since every marga leads one ultimately to the one  
marga of self attention, there is no quarrel, in that sense.   
I also refer to Michael James as you have mentioned. He is the guy who read  
and mastered Tamizh while simultaneously venturing understanding and  
practicing Bhagavan Ramana's methods. Hence his books and translations are  
really of a higher order. In his   
Happiness and the Art of Being, he refers to ULLadu Narpadu   
verses and he always gives in italics the Tamizh word or phrases and again and  
again use many ways to describe the purport.   
Arunachala Siva.

OK   
How many of you tried "Awareness Watching Awareness" and found it different  
from Remaining as Self or Self inquiry?   
I tried it, and i see that its just the same. I do not find any difference.  
Whether one says, remain as Awareness within or Be Still, how does it matter?   
Its just the same!

You are absolutely correct. The best course is to simply maintain silence. I  
have always found the tamizh works of Ramana more clearer than any of the  
other languages, it may be because it is my mother tongue, but I did not know  
how to read or write tamizh, but due to Bhagavan's grace, I am learning to  
read and write tamizh now atleast I am able to read it slowly though.   
Personally, I feel, Bhagavan's teachings are to be discussed within the Self  
alone, in the course of enquiry itself and not outside. One has to taste the  
tea himself to know its taste, no matter what elaboration anybody gives, is  
going to be of no avail.   
It is due to the Vasana of finding out answers to our questions that breeds  
questions and endless discussions. Bhagavans says, we need not know any  
answers at all. We fail to recognise the very presence of Bhagavan Ramana, if  
he is not there physically, does it mean that he is not going to clear our  
questions within? its because of this wrong notion, that we begin to discuss  
our issues or questions and it leads to analyses over analyses. What we need  
is a strong belief or Faith or Shraddha that Bhagavan will clear all doubts  
Himself and I need not ask anybody and that He himself will reveal it to me in  
any way, maybe an unknown person would come and say something in some other  
context, or through some incidents. We just need to remain alive and keep the  
enquiry always going. Like how Dhathathreya had 24 Gurus, most of them being  
animals, in a similar way, Bhagavan will bestow on us the clarity in some way  
or the other.   
To ask doubts and discussing it is going outwards. We have to remain within  
our self - holding on just to 'I' alone.   
In Talks: 253: Bhagavan has said The illiterates are certainly better off than the  
literates whose egos are not destroyed by the quest of the self.   
355: "Illiteracy is ignorance: education is learned ignorance. Both of them  
are ignorant of their true aim; whereas a sage is not ignorant because there  
is no aim for him."   
D.: Mind itself is very subtle and is also the same as the Atman.   
How shall we know the nature of the mind? You have said that all   
supports are useless. What should be our stand then?   
M.: Where does your mind stand?   
D.: Where does it stand?   
M.: Ask the mind itself.   
D.: I ask you now. Should we concentrate on mind then?   
M.: Um!   
D.: But what is the nature of the mind? It is formless. The problem   
is perplexing.   
M.: Why are you perplexed?   
D.: The sastras want us to concentrate and I cannot do so.   
M.: Through what sastras have we known our existence?   
D.: It is a matter of experience. But I want to concentrate.   
M.: Be free from thoughts. Do not hold on to anything. They do not   
hold you. Be yourself.   
D.: I do not yet understand as to where I take my stand and concentrate.   
Can I meditate on my mind?   
M.: Whose mind?   
D.: My own mind?   
M.: Who are you? The question now resolves itself all right.   
(All retired for lunch. The visitor returned at 2-30 p.m. and pursued   
the same question.)   
He said: Maharshi advises the seeker to get rid of thoughts. On what   
should I concentrate the mind after all the thoughts are expelled? I   
do not see where I stand then and on what I should concentrate.   
M.: For whom is the concentration?   
D.: For the mind.   
M.: Then concentrate the mind.   
D.: On what?   
M.: Answer the question yourself. What is the mind? Why should   
you concentrate?   
D.: I do not know what the mind is. I ask Maharshi.   
M.: Maharshi does not seek to know the mind. The questioner must   
question the mind itself as to what it is.   
 **D.: Maharshi advises that the mind should be divested of thoughts.   
M.: This is itself a thought.**   
D.: When all thoughts disappear what remains over?   
M.: Is the mind different from thoughts?   
 **D.: No. The mind is made up of thoughts. My point is this: When all   
thoughts are got rid of, how shall I concentrate the mind?   
M.: Is not this also a thought?**   
D.: Yes, but I am advised to concentrate.   
M.: Why should you concentrate? Why should you not allow your   
thoughts free play?   
D.: The sastras say that the thoughts, thus playing free, lead us astray,   
that is, to unreal and changeful things.   
M.: So then, you want not to be led to unreal and changeful things. Your   
thoughts are unreal and changeful. You want to hold the Reality. That   
is exactly what I say. The thoughts are unreal. Get rid of them.   
 **D.: I understand now. Yet there is a doubt. Not a trice can you remain   
inactive. How shall I be able to rid myself of thoughts?   
M.: The same Gita says: Although all actions take place, I am not the doer.   
It is like the sun towards the world activities. The Self always remains   
actionless, whereas thoughts arise and subside. The Self is Perfection; it   
is immutable; the mind is limited and changeful. You need only to cast   
off your limitations. Your perfection thus stands revealed.**   
D.: Grace is necessary for it.   
 _ **M.: Grace is ever present. All that is necessary is that you surrender to  
It.**_   
D.: I surrender and pray that even if I go wrong I may be forcibly   
drawn to it.   
 **M.: Is this surrender? Surrender to be complete must be   
unquestioning.**   
D.: Yes, I surrender. You say I must dive into the ocean of the Self   
like a pearl-diver into the sea.   
M.: Because you are now thinking that you are out of the ocean of   
Consciousness.   
D.: I practise pranayama. It generates heat in the body. What should   
I do?   
M.: The heat will pass away when the mind gains calm   
D.: That is true but most difficult.   
 **M.: This is again a thought which is an obstacle.

how can thought obstruct the Self?   
how can a building obstruct the space?

I agree with Udai agru.   
Even Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami also says the same thing.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Mano Nasam means only destruction of  
ignorance in the mind but not destruction of mind.   
If really problems solve by killing our mind then it can be solved by taking  
some injection like anaesthesia. :-)   
So solution is to know that we are not the mind and it is mithya i.e dependent  
on our real naturre i.e sat-chit-ananda.

The point is : mind cannot be killed, coz its never alive to be killed.   
like the snake on a rope. should the snake be killed?   
i am awareness, right now -- there is no choice here.   
and as awareness, i "CANNOT" get sad, happy or anything else. AS AWareness, i  
a Every STillness.   
so its not "Be Still" \-- u R STILLNESS. .. no choice here!   
so when someone says "I WILL BE STILL" thats foolish. As Awareness there is no  
choice. One is STILLNESS ITSELF.   
AS mind, one cannot remain still... coz mind by nature is unreal. mind cannot  
become SAT.   
So, here is the problem. People want the mind to be Still... body to stop  
growing!! how is it ever possible.   
body by its nature has to grow old. mind by its nature has to change. Self  
cannot Change.   
This is the essence.   
Swami Suddhananda gives a nice example: Someone was asked "What is ur age", he  
said "30". "But u said the same thing 10 years ago", asked another who was  
present there. "That is right, i tell the truth and truth cannot change", was  
his reply!   
what kind of truth is that??   
The attempt to stop the mirage like world from appearing is also a mistake.  
coz it shall continue as long as one's prarabdha is there unfinished. no one  
can stop it.   
Love!

The very entity which also says that mind cannot be killed is mind itself.   
In the snake and rope example, snake is an illusion - Mithya and the rope is  
Asat.

Awareness is completely pure. Why is there a need to affirm that I am  
awareness? and to whom is this made?

yes. its mind that is saying.   
and that knowledge "u r awareness" is required for mind only.   
coz, the Self never needs this knowledge. Body cannot have it.   
Its very simple.   
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too?   
is not the instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for  
mind.   
MITHYA and ASAT have one basic difference. Mithya is like a mirage. it appears  
to be present, though its purely ASAT.   
So one cannot stop the appearance. it continues.

Dear I,   
In total agreement with your points, I would like to bring in my views in the  
same example quoted by you: Quote from: srkudai on June 28, 2010, 12:47:37 PM  
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r

but that which is outside", its for mind.   
Silence  
when the sage comes on the screen and says u are not this, you are not that  
and etc... and what ever you decide to do: 1 Stop the movie,   
2 continue the movie   
3 follow the sage   
4 not listen the sage   
5 do self enquiry   
6 letting the movie continue by allowing the assitant director to decide on  
the next scenarios believing that it cannot affect me, etc...   
these are still part of the movie itself. These are all the various courses  
the mind has, as options in the movie, as the director. These are "Freewill"  
which the i believes it has, which it can use to do what i wants to.   
Movie is in reality, not there at all, movie exist only for the mind alone  
which is non-self. In ignorance, the character itself, is the one which has  
created the movie and various scenarios and also the sage who comes and says  
you are not this you are that is just another character in the movie created  
by the mind again to make the movie more interesting, thats all.   
Once the character discards his dress knowing its limitedness - means there is  
no more i at all, no director at all, there is no more movie anymore. Movie  
existed only for the mithya i.   
The instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for mind." is  
itself just Mithya as well. It is just a story in the movie, which the i gets  
identified with whereby 'i' mistakenly takes these instruction for itself and  
begins to enquire who am i, I am the Self, I am this and I am that. these are  
all again just illusions. There is no need for self enquiry as well.   
There is no movie at all.   
Appearance is only for the 'i' mind alone. as long as the mind exists  
appearances will continue, as appearances are all the creations of the mind  
alone. Where there are no appearances and where only  
awareness/consciousness/Self alone IS, is real. _Where appearances still are_  
, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Devotees,   
 I would like to share some of my views on various comments by forum members. Members comments are given in bold and my comments are in italics.   
1\. AWA is not Self enquiry since the moment the word watching is used, then  
the   
 subject object relation ship comes into picture and hence it cannot be the state of   
 BEING..Also how can awareness be watched?   
 _  
Comments: Mr. Michael Langford has mentioned that Awareness Watching  
Awareness is Awareness Being Awareness and he also says that because of long  
ancient habit of looking outwards towards people places and things, the word  
watching is used in practice instructions. Also he says that that way we take  
that same habit of watching people, places and things and we shut our eyes and  
turn it inwards. That is why the word watching is used. **Mr.Michael Langford  
says that what is real is awareness watching awareness, looking inward. What  
is unreal is looking outward towards the world of people places and things.  
Hence AWA is in line with Bjhagavans Self Enquiry   
**There are some comments in the forum that how can awareness be watched? If  
the word watching is inappropriate, then a doubt arises in mind how the  
word enquiry is appropriate in Self enquiry. When the word enquiry is used  
then doubt arises about who should enquire and whether self can be enquired  
and if self can be enquired then there must be enquirer similar to watcher in  
the word watching. All these doubts do not arise if tamil word SUMMA IRU is  
used to denote self enquiry**. Bhagavan ramana maharishi has instructed my  
mother around 80 years ago when she was a child that she should read  
Bhagavans works in the same language in which it was originally composed.I  
remember to have read some where that Bhagavan has given similar  
instructions to Annamalai Swami. Bhagavan has composed his great works such  
as   
 Nan Yar, Upadesa Undiar, Ulladhu Naarpathu,Arunachala Akshara mana malai etc  
in Tamil and when it is translated in other languages, it does not convey the  
same meaning as in tamil.. **In this context, I would like members to go  
through the commentary in English on Nan Yar by Mr.Michel James where in he  
uses the same original tamil words in many places in his commentary to  
ensure that the meaning is not distorted.**_   
[/b]   
2.As per AWA, it should be done on certain hours.   
 _Comments:Mr Michael Langford says that spend as many hours per day  
practicing as you can. **If you only practice awareness watching awareness for  
30 minutes per day and spend the other 23 and a half hours looking outward,  
you will not progress very quickly. If you want rapid results, then drop your  
unnecessary activities to free up time so you can practice for many hours per  
day, everyday. Maybe once per week on one of your days off from work you can  
devote the whole day to just practicing awareness watching awareness. Again  
this is in line with Bhagavans teachings that vichara should be done  
throughout the entire waking state   
**_ [/b]   
3.As per AWA, one should practice with eyes closed.   
 _Comments:To a question put to Bhagavan whether eyes should be open or not  
like this Bhagaan answers thus   
A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes it happens that when the eyes are  
closed the latent thoughts rush forth with great vigour. It may also be  
difficult to introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of  
mind to do so. The mind is contaminated when it takes in objects. Otherwise,  
it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind active in its own  
pursuit without taking in external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
 **From the very first sentence in Bhagavan s answer, it is evident that it  
may be done either way.**   
_   
4.As per AWA,ten methods are suggested and how can there be 10 methods since  
there is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being still.   
 _Comments: In Hinduism, four margas(paths) are prescribed for realization  
and devotees can follow any marga to reach the goal of Self realization. In  
Guru Ramana Mr.Cohen, quotes Bhagavan and says that the ultimate goal is  
realize the self and the paths are left to individuals. In fact, Bhagavan has  
told that Bakthi and Jnana are one and the same. In this context, I would like  
to quote an explanation given by late Paramacharya of Kanchi Mutt Sri  
Chandrasekara Saraswathi Swamigal. A devotee had a genuine doubt and asked  
Paramacharya why Paramacharya is confined to pujas and rituals and does not  
perform siddhis(miracles) like Sri. Sathya Sai Baba.. Paramacharya replied  
that the goal of his and Sri.Sathya Sa Baba are one and the same ie to bring  
everybody in to divinity and only difference is that they adopt different  
techniques like marketing people adopt different techniques to sell the goods.   
Bhagvan has given all the spiritual instructions very crystal clear and in  
simple language. In spite of that, during his life time, we can find devotees  
going on questioning about self enquiry again and again and this is evident  
if we go through the bookTalks wherein similar questions on self enquiry  
are repeated at number of places by different devotees. These devotees who put  
questions to hagavan are not ordinary layman but intellectuals and highly  
learned. **In order to cater to needs of people with different caliber,  
Micheal has given different methods and he is not suggested to follow all  
methods. It is left to individuals to follow the method which suits him  
best.This is in line with Bhagavan suggesting two methods ie doing sadhana  
with closed eyes and with open eyes. Which ever suits a devotee, he can follow  
it. Ultimately, the goal is to turn our attention inwards to the subject from  
objects.**   
 **All 10 methods suggested by Mr.Michael boils down to turning the  
attention inwards only and nothing else. Once a devotee becomes proficient in  
practice, he can practice sadhana eyes closed/open, one hour a day to 24  
hours a day,walking/sitting /laying/at rest room/ brushing his teeth. Only  
time he cannot do is while at sleep and when he is actively engaged in any  
work.When he is engaged in any serious activity, he automatically goes into  
meditation since his full attention is on that activity and there no  
thoughts**.   
**To conclude, I am fully convinced by Bhagavans teaching that at some  
point of time, we should forget what we have learned, stop reading books and  
turn our attention inwards. By mere reading various scriptures and endless  
discussion does not lead to realization unless we practice what we have  
learned.. To quote swami Sivananda of Rishikesh, an ounce of practice is  
better than tons of reading. In Sanskrit, it is known as Sravanam, mananam and  
Nithidyasanam and in Tirukkural, Tiruvallur says Karka Kashadara  
Karka.karrapin Nirka Thaga when means read and understand well and then  
practice what you have learnt. Do we[/b_**]?

It is the tendancy of our nature that we complicate things by not only our own  
analysis but also analysis of analyses itself.   
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
These are just tools for 'I' so that it can simply continue in the garb of  
spiritual enquiry and enjoy its existence. It does not at akk matter if  
awareness is watching awareness or awareness is not watching awareness,  
whether Ramana's teachings are same as Michal James or different, whether  
Bhakti yoga is same as Jnana Yoga or different. Whether my point is accepted  
here or rejected. whether the discussions is helping or not.   
'I' \- just hold on to it, everything else is play and only play: Merry-  
Go-Round   
Self Enquiry is like the passive observer. A classic example which Shankara  
Bhagavatpadal has given is that of the bird Dove which lays eggs and carefully  
guards it everyday and accumulates food for it from various places and when  
the eggs are going to hatch, one day the crow comes pushes the eggs down from  
the nest and eats all the eggs and just born dove. The dove, which comes there  
just sees all this without reaction. It just remains.   
Such should be our enquiry.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Here is the classic pic taken from the famous movie Adi Shankaracharya. Its  
one of the best examples as to how our enquiry has to be carried on: Crow and dove.Crow is the doer, the active one.The dove is the passive  
observer, the atman(inner self) - our attention should be always focussed only  
on this.   
instead of focusing our attention on the 'I', if the Dove begins to fight with  
the crow, it is only going to cause damage and loss of peace. Just remaining  
indifferent to what is happening, remaining in the world, carrying out our  
duties, we should remain like the Dove with our attention focused on the Self  
till our Prarabhha karma is dissolved.

Dear Mr.Nagaraj,   
 I agree with your comments as above.When we know that who am I is simply holding on to the "I", why so many posts in this forum on various headings on various topics?. **Bhagavan has given his first teaching "Naan Yar' crystal clear without any room for doubt and still do we require endless discussions on his teachings ?** **It is enough if only Bhagavan 's teachings alone are published in this site as being done by Sri Subramanian and Mr.Prasanth (Both of them are doing great service) and there are sufficient material for them to publish more of Bhagaan's works for many years**.This will help members who have not so far gone thro his books and for the one who has already gone through, it will help to refresh.Few years back, Swami Chinmayananda was invited to a Ramana function and was asked to deliver his talk on Bhagavan Ramana.He did not deliver lecture and instead sat in silence forsome time and at the end told the audience that this is what bhagavan's teaching. **Bhagavan says that Silence is ever speaking and it is interrupted by speaking.Are we following his teachings?

## Re:[34] Is 'Awareness Watching Awareness'-method same as Sri Bhagavan's Self- Attention?

Dear viswanathan   
I agree with your detailed clarfifcations on the points of Michael   
Langford 'Awareness Watching Awareness'. The problems in   
any translation of the original work are that one has to compromise   
with some loss of beauty and cadence. A friend of mine, long time   
back, went to study Russian, to read Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace   
in original. But most of us cannot do that way. Why? Even Tamizhians today  
cannot properly read and understand classical   
Tamizh works like Bhagavan's ULLadu Narpadu. The untranslatatbility of Tamizh  
is quite high. In Tamizh, one often goes even without a verb. Nan Yaar means  
only "I Who" and not   
"Who am I?" Hence many problems have to be confronted by the   
translators. So long as Langford clarifies Watching means Being,   
then, as I already wrote, there is no problem. Even in Sanskrit,   
sometimes the word Darshan means not seeing but being. Siva darshan sometimes  
means Being Siva or Being in Sivam.   
As regards methods, again since every marga leads one ultimately to the one  
marga of self attention, there is no quarrel, in that sense.   
I also refer to Michael James as you have mentioned. He is the guy who read  
and mastered Tamizh while simultaneously venturing understanding and  
practicing Bhagavan Ramana's methods. Hence his books and translations are  
really of a higher order. In his   
Happiness and the Art of Being, he refers to ULLadu Narpadu   
verses and he always gives in italics the Tamizh word or phrases and again and  
again use many ways to describe the purport.   
Arunachala Siva.

OK   
How many of you tried "Awareness Watching Awareness" and found it different  
from Remaining as Self or Self inquiry?   
I tried it, and i see that its just the same. I do not find any difference.  
Whether one says, remain as Awareness within or Be Still, how does it matter?   
Its just the same!

Dear I,   
Quote from: viswanathan on June 28, 2010, 03:16:39 AM  
 I agree with your comments as above.When we know that who am I is simply holding on to the "I", why so many posts in this forum on various headings on various topics?. **Bhagavan has given his first teaching "Naan Yar' crystal clear without any room for doubt and still do we require endless discussions on his teachings ?** **It is enough if only Bhagavan 's teachings alone are published in this site as being done by Sri Subramanian and Mr.Prasanth (Both of them are doing great service) and there are sufficient material for them to publish more of Bhagaan's works for many years**.This will help members who have not so far gone thro his books and for the one who has already gone through, it will help to refresh.Few years back, Swami Chinmayananda was invited to a Ramana function and was asked to deliver his talk on Bhagavan Ramana.He did not deliver lecture and instead sat in silence forsome time and at the end told the audience that this is what bhagavan's teaching. **Bhagavan says that Silence is ever speaking and it is interrupted by speaking.Are we following his teachings?**  
You are absolutely correct. The best course is to simply maintain silence. I  
have always found the tamizh works of Ramana more clearer than any of the  
other languages, it may be because it is my mother tongue, but I did not know  
how to read or write tamizh, but due to Bhagavan's grace, I am learning to  
read and write tamizh now atleast I am able to read it slowly though.   
Personally, I feel, Bhagavan's teachings are to be discussed within the Self  
alone, in the course of enquiry itself and not outside. One has to taste the  
tea himself to know its taste, no matter what elaboration anybody gives, is  
going to be of no avail.   
It is due to the Vasana of finding out answers to our questions that breeds  
questions and endless discussions. Bhagavans says, we need not know any  
answers at all. We fail to recognise the very presence of Bhagavan Ramana, if  
he is not there physically, does it mean that he is not going to clear our  
questions within? its because of this wrong notion, that we begin to discuss  
our issues or questions and it leads to analyses over analyses. What we need  
is a strong belief or Faith or Shraddha that Bhagavan will clear all doubts  
Himself and I need not ask anybody and that He himself will reveal it to me in  
any way, maybe an unknown person would come and say something in some other  
context, or through some incidents. We just need to remain alive and keep the  
enquiry always going. Like how Dhathathreya had 24 Gurus, most of them being  
animals, in a similar way, Bhagavan will bestow on us the clarity in some way  
or the other.   
To ask doubts and discussing it is going outwards. We have to remain within  
our self - holding on just to 'I' alone.   
In Talks: 253: Bhagavan has said The illiterates are certainly better off than the  
literates whose egos are not destroyed by the quest of the self.   
355: "Illiteracy is ignorance: education is learned ignorance. Both of them  
are ignorant of their true aim; whereas a sage is not ignorant because there  
is no aim for him."   
D.: Mind itself is very subtle and is also the same as the Atman.   
How shall we know the nature of the mind? You have said that all   
supports are useless. What should be our stand then?   
M.: Where does your mind stand?   
D.: Where does it stand?   
M.: Ask the mind itself.   
D.: I ask you now. Should we concentrate on mind then?   
M.: Um!   
D.: But what is the nature of the mind? It is formless. The problem   
is perplexing.   
M.: Why are you perplexed?   
D.: The sastras want us to concentrate and I cannot do so.   
M.: Through what sastras have we known our existence?   
D.: It is a matter of experience. But I want to concentrate.   
M.: Be free from thoughts. Do not hold on to anything. They do not   
hold you. Be yourself.   
D.: I do not yet understand as to where I take my stand and concentrate.   
Can I meditate on my mind?   
M.: Whose mind?   
D.: My own mind?   
M.: Who are you? The question now resolves itself all right.   
(All retired for lunch. The visitor returned at 2-30 p.m. and pursued   
the same question.)   
He said: Maharshi advises the seeker to get rid of thoughts. On what   
should I concentrate the mind after all the thoughts are expelled? I   
do not see where I stand then and on what I should concentrate.   
M.: For whom is the concentration?   
D.: For the mind.   
M.: Then concentrate the mind.   
D.: On what?   
M.: Answer the question yourself. What is the mind? Why should   
you concentrate?   
D.: I do not know what the mind is. I ask Maharshi.   
M.: Maharshi does not seek to know the mind. The questioner must   
question the mind itself as to what it is.   
 **D.: Maharshi advises that the mind should be divested of thoughts.   
M.: This is itself a thought.**   
D.: When all thoughts disappear what remains over?   
M.: Is the mind different from thoughts?   
 **D.: No. The mind is made up of thoughts. My point is this: When all   
thoughts are got rid of, how shall I concentrate the mind?   
M.: Is not this also a thought?**   
D.: Yes, but I am advised to concentrate.   
M.: Why should you concentrate? Why should you not allow your   
thoughts free play?   
D.: The sastras say that the thoughts, thus playing free, lead us astray,   
that is, to unreal and changeful things.   
M.: So then, you want not to be led to unreal and changeful things. Your   
thoughts are unreal and changeful. You want to hold the Reality. That   
is exactly what I say. The thoughts are unreal. Get rid of them.   
 **D.: I understand now. Yet there is a doubt. Not a trice can you remain   
inactive. How shall I be able to rid myself of thoughts?   
M.: The same Gita says: Although all actions take place, I am not the doer.   
It is like the sun towards the world activities. The Self always remains   
actionless, whereas thoughts arise and subside. The Self is Perfection; it   
is immutable; the mind is limited and changeful. You need only to cast   
off your limitations. Your perfection thus stands revealed.**   
D.: Grace is necessary for it.   
 _ **M.: Grace is ever present. All that is necessary is that you surrender to  
It.**_   
D.: I surrender and pray that even if I go wrong I may be forcibly   
drawn to it.   
 **M.: Is this surrender? Surrender to be complete must be   
unquestioning.**   
D.: Yes, I surrender. You say I must dive into the ocean of the Self   
like a pearl-diver into the sea.   
M.: Because you are now thinking that you are out of the ocean of   
Consciousness.   
D.: I practise pranayama. It generates heat in the body. What should   
I do?   
M.: The heat will pass away when the mind gains calm   
D.: That is true but most difficult.   
 **M.: This is again a thought which is an obstacle.

I agree with Udai agru.   
Even Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami also says the same thing.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Mano Nasam means only destruction of  
ignorance in the mind but not destruction of mind.   
If really problems solve by killing our mind then it can be solved by taking  
some injection like anaesthesia. :-)   
So solution is to know that we are not the mind and it is mithya i.e dependent  
on our real naturre i.e sat-chit-ananda.

Dear I,   
I would rather put it this way: When the glass tumbler is half filled with water. One says its half filled and  
the other says its half empty.   
Thats all is the difference.

The point is : mind cannot be killed, coz its never alive to be killed.   
like the snake on a rope. should the snake be killed?   
i am awareness, right now -- there is no choice here.   
and as awareness, i "CANNOT" get sad, happy or anything else. AS AWareness, i  
a Every STillness.   
so its not "Be Still" \-- u R STILLNESS. .. no choice here!   
so when someone says "I WILL BE STILL" thats foolish. As Awareness there is no  
choice. One is STILLNESS ITSELF.   
AS mind, one cannot remain still... coz mind by nature is unreal. mind cannot  
become SAT.   
So, here is the problem. People want the mind to be Still... body to stop  
growing!! how is it ever possible.   
body by its nature has to grow old. mind by its nature has to change. Self  
cannot Change.   
This is the essence.   
Swami Suddhananda gives a nice example: Someone was asked "What is ur age", he  
said "30". "But u said the same thing 10 years ago", asked another who was  
present there. "That is right, i tell the truth and truth cannot change", was  
his reply!   
what kind of truth is that??   
The attempt to stop the mirage like world from appearing is also a mistake.  
coz it shall continue as long as one's prarabdha is there unfinished. no one  
can stop it.   
Love!   
Silence

The very entity which also says that mind cannot be killed is mind itself.   
In the snake and rope example, snake is an illusion - Mithya and the rope is  
Asat.

Awareness is completely pure. Why is there a need to affirm that I am  
awareness? and to whom is this made?

yes. its mind that is saying.   
and that knowledge "u r awareness" is required for mind only.   
coz, the Self never needs this knowledge. Body cannot have it.   
Its very simple.   
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too?   
is not the instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for  
mind.   
MITHYA and ASAT have one basic difference. Mithya is like a mirage. it appears  
to be present, though its purely ASAT.   
So one cannot stop the appearance. it continues.

Dear I,   
In total agreement with your points, I would like to bring in my views in the  
same example quoted by you: Quote from: srkudai on June 28, 2010, 12:47:37 PM  
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too? is not the instruction "u r not this,  
but that which is outside", its for mind.   
Silence  
when the sage comes on the screen and says u are not this, you are not that  
and etc... and what ever you decide to do: 1 Stop the movie,   
2 continue the movie   
3 follow the sage   
4 not listen the sage   
5 do self enquiry   
6 letting the movie continue by allowing the assitant director to decide on  
the next scenarios believing that it cannot affect me, etc...   
these are still part of the movie itself. These are all the various courses  
the mind has, as options in the movie, as the director. These are "Freewill"  
which the i believes it has, which it can use to do what i wants to.   
Movie is in reality, not there at all, movie exist only for the mind alone  
which is non-self. In ignorance, the character itself, is the one which has  
created the movie and various scenarios and also the sage who comes and says  
you are not this you are that is just another character in the movie created  
by the mind again to make the movie more interesting, thats all.   
Once the character discards his dress knowing its limitedness - means there is  
no more i at all, no director at all, there is no more movie anymore. Movie  
existed only for the mithya i.   
The instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for mind." is  
itself just Mithya as well. It is just a story in the movie, which the i gets  
identified with whereby 'i' mistakenly takes these instruction for itself and  
begins to enquire who am i, I am the Self, I am this and I am that. these are  
all again just illusions. There is no need for self enquiry as well.   
There is no movie at all.   
Appearance is only for the 'i' mind alone. as long as the mind exists  
appearances will continue, as appearances are all the creations of the mind  
alone. Where there are no appearances and where only  
awareness/consciousness/Self alone IS, is real. _Where appearances still are_  
, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.

Dear Devotees,   
 I would like to share some of my views on various comments by forum members. Members comments are given in bold and my comments are in italics.   
1\. AWA is not Self enquiry since the moment the word watching is used, then  
the   
 subject object relation ship comes into picture and hence it cannot be the state of   
 BEING..Also how can awareness be watched?   
 _  
Comments: Mr. Michael Langford has mentioned that Awareness Watching  
Awareness is Awareness Being Awareness and he also says that because of long  
ancient habit of looking outwards towards people places and things, the word  
watching is used in practice instructions. Also he says that that way we take  
that same habit of watching people, places and things and we shut our eyes and  
turn it inwards. That is why the word watching is used. **Mr.Michael Langford  
says that what is real is awareness watching awareness, looking inward. What  
is unreal is looking outward towards the world of people places and things.  
Hence AWA is in line with Bjhagavans Self Enquiry   
**There are some comments in the forum that how can awareness be watched? If  
the word watching is inappropriate, then a doubt arises in mind how the  
word enquiry is appropriate in Self enquiry. When the word enquiry is used  
then doubt arises about who should enquire and whether self can be enquired  
and if self can be enquired then there must be enquirer similar to watcher in  
the word watching. All these doubts do not arise if tamil word SUMMA IRU is  
used to denote self enquiry**. Bhagavan ramana maharishi has instructed my  
mother around 80 years ago when she was a child that she should read  
Bhagavans works in the same language in which it was originally composed.I  
remember to have read some where that Bhagavan has given similar  
instructions to Annamalai Swami. Bhagavan has composed his great works such  
as   
 Nan Yar, Upadesa Undiar, Ulladhu Naarpathu,Arunachala Akshara mana malai etc  
in Tamil and when it is translated in other languages, it does not convey the  
same meaning as in tamil.. **In this context, I would like members to go  
through the commentary in English on Nan Yar by Mr.Michel James where in he  
uses the same original tamil words in many places in his commentary to  
ensure that the meaning is not distorted.**_   
[/b]   
2.As per AWA, it should be done on certain hours.   
 _Comments:Mr Michael Langford says that spend as many hours per day  
practicing as you can. **If you only practice awareness watching awareness for  
30 minutes per day and spend the other 23 and a half hours looking outward,  
you will not progress very quickly. If you want rapid results, then drop your  
unnecessary activities to free up time so you can practice for many hours per  
day, everyday. Maybe once per week on one of your days off from work you can  
devote the whole day to just practicing awareness watching awareness. Again  
this is in line with Bhagavans teachings that vichara should be done  
throughout the entire waking state   
**_ [/b]   
3.As per AWA, one should practice with eyes closed.   
 _Comments:To a question put to Bhagavan whether eyes should be open or not  
like this Bhagaan answers thus   
A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes it happens that when the eyes are  
closed the latent thoughts rush forth with great vigour. It may also be  
difficult to introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of  
mind to do so. The mind is contaminated when it takes in objects. Otherwise,  
it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind active in its own  
pursuit without taking in external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
 **From the very first sentence in Bhagavan s answer, it is evident that it  
may be done either way.**   
_   
4.As per AWA,ten methods are suggested and how can there be 10 methods since  
there is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being still.   
 _Comments: In Hinduism, four margas(paths) are prescribed for realization  
and devotees can follow any marga to reach the goal of Self realization. In  
Guru Ramana Mr.Cohen, quotes Bhagavan and says that the ultimate goal is  
realize the self and the paths are left to individuals. In fact, Bhagavan has  
told that Bakthi and Jnana are one and the same. In this context, I would like  
to quote an explanation given by late Paramacharya of Kanchi Mutt Sri  
Chandrasekara Saraswathi Swamigal. A devotee had a genuine doubt and asked  
Paramacharya why Paramacharya is confined to pujas and rituals and does not  
perform siddhis(miracles) like Sri. Sathya Sai Baba.. Paramacharya replied  
that the goal of his and Sri.Sathya Sa Baba are one and the same ie to bring  
everybody in to divinity and only difference is that they adopt different  
techniques like marketing people adopt different techniques to sell the goods.   
Bhagvan has given all the spiritual instructions very crystal clear and in  
simple language. In spite of that, during his life time, we can find devotees  
going on questioning about self enquiry again and again and this is evident  
if we go through the bookTalks wherein similar questions on self enquiry  
are repeated at number of places by different devotees. These devotees who put  
questions to hagavan are not ordinary layman but intellectuals and highly  
learned. **In order to cater to needs of people with different caliber,  
Micheal has given different methods and he is not suggested to follow all  
methods. It is left to individuals to follow the method which suits him  
best.This is in line with Bhagavan suggesting two methods ie doing sadhana  
with closed eyes and with open eyes. Which ever suits a devotee, he can follow  
it. Ultimately, the goal is to turn our attention inwards to the subject from  
objects.**   
 **All 10 methods suggested by Mr.Michael boils down to turning the  
attention inwards only and nothing else. Once a devotee becomes proficient in  
practice, he can practice sadhana eyes closed/open, one hour a day to 24  
hours a day,walking/sitting /laying/at rest room/ brushing his teeth. Only  
time he cannot do is while at sleep and when he is actively engaged in any  
work.When he is engaged in any serious activity, he automatically goes into  
meditation since his full attention is on that activity and there no  
thoughts**.   
**To conclude, I am fully convinced by Bhagavans teaching that at some  
point of time, we should forget what we have learned, stop reading books and  
turn our attention inwards. By mere reading various scriptures and endless  
discussion does not lead to realization unless we practice what we have  
learned.. To quote swami Sivananda of Rishikesh, an ounce of practice is  
better than tons of reading. In Sanskrit, it is known as Sravanam, mananam and  
Nithidyasanam and in Tirukkural, Tiruvallur says Karka Kashadara  
Karka.karrapin Nirka Thaga when means read and understand well and then  
practice what you have learnt. Do we[/b_**]?

It is the tendancy of our nature that we complicate things by not only our own  
analysis but also analysis of analyses itself.   
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
These are just tools for 'I' so that it can simply continue in the garb of  
spiritual enquiry and enjoy its existence. It does not at akk matter if  
awareness is watching awareness or awareness is not watching awareness,  
whether Ramana's teachings are same as Michal James or different, whether  
Bhakti yoga is same as Jnana Yoga or different. Whether my point is accepted  
here or rejected. whether the discussions is helping or not.   
'I' \- just hold on to it, everything else is play and only play: Merry-  
Go-Round   
Self Enquiry is like the passive observer. A classic example which Shankara  
Bhagavatpadal has given is that of the bird Dove which lays eggs and carefully  
guards it everyday and accumulates food for it from various places and when  
the eggs are going to hatch, one day the crow comes pushes the eggs down from  
the nest and eats all the eggs and just born dove. The dove, which comes there  
just sees all this without reaction. It just remains.   
Such should be our enquiry.

Here is the classic pic taken from the famous movie Adi Shankaracharya. Its  
one of the best examples as to how our enquiry has to be carried on: Crow and dove.Crow is the doer, the active one.The dove is the passive  
observer, the atman(inner self) - our attention should be always focussed only  
on this.   
instead of focusing our attention on the 'I', if the Dove begins to fight with  
the crow, it is only going to cause damage and loss of peace. Just remaining  
indifferent to what is happening, remaining in the world, carrying out our  
duties, we should remain like the Dove with our attention focused on the Self  
till our Prarabhha karma is dissolved.

Dear Mr.Nagaraj,   
 I agree with your comments as above.When we know that who am I is simply holding on to the "I", why so many posts in this forum on various headings on various topics?. **Bhagavan has given his first teaching "Naan Yar' crystal clear without any room for doubt and still do we require endless discussions on his teachings ?** **It is enough if only Bhagavan 's teachings alone are published in this site as being done by Sri Subramanian and Mr.Prasanth (Both of them are doing great service) and there are sufficient material for them to publish more of Bhagaan's works for many years**.This will help members who have not so far gone thro his books and for the one who has already gone through, it will help to refresh.Few years back, Swami Chinmayananda was invited to a Ramana function and was asked to deliver his talk on Bhagavan Ramana.He did not deliver lecture and instead sat in silence forsome time and at the end told the audience that this is what bhagavan's teaching. **Bhagavan says that Silence is ever speaking and it is interrupted by speaking.Are we following his teachings?

Dear viswanathan   
I agree with your detailed clarfifcations on the points of Michael   
Langford 'Awareness Watching Awareness'. The problems in   
any translation of the original work are that one has to compromise   
with some loss of beauty and cadence. A friend of mine, long time   
back, went to study Russian, to read Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace   
in original. But most of us cannot do that way. Why? Even Tamizhians today  
cannot properly read and understand classical   
Tamizh works like Bhagavan's ULLadu Narpadu. The untranslatatbility of Tamizh  
is quite high. In Tamizh, one often goes even without a verb. Nan Yaar means  
only "I Who" and not   
"Who am I?" Hence many problems have to be confronted by the   
translators. So long as Langford clarifies Watching means Being,   
then, as I already wrote, there is no problem. Even in Sanskrit,   
sometimes the word Darshan means not seeing but being. Siva darshan sometimes  
means Being Siva or Being in Sivam.   
As regards methods, again since every marga leads one ultimately to the one  
marga of self attention, there is no quarrel, in that sense.   
I also refer to Michael James as you have mentioned. He is the guy who read  
and mastered Tamizh while simultaneously venturing understanding and  
practicing Bhagavan Ramana's methods. Hence his books and translations are  
really of a higher order. In his   
Happiness and the Art of Being, he refers to ULLadu Narpadu   
verses and he always gives in italics the Tamizh word or phrases and again and  
again use many ways to describe the purport.   
Arunachala Siva.

How many of you tried "Awareness Watching Awareness" and found it different  
from Remaining as Self or Self inquiry?   
I tried it, and i see that its just the same. I do not find any difference.  
Whether one says, remain as Awareness within or Be Still, how does it matter?   
Its just the same!

Dear I,   
Quote from: viswanathan on June 28, 2010, 03:16:39 AM  
 I agree with your comments as above.When we know that who am I is simply holding on to the "I", why so many posts in this forum on various headings on various topics?. **Bhagavan has given his first teaching "Naan Yar' crystal clear without any room for doubt and still do we require endless discussions on his teachings ?** **It is enough if only Bhagavan 's teachings alone are published in this site as being done by Sri Subramanian and Mr.Prasanth (Both of them are doing great service) and there are sufficient material for them to publish more of Bhagaan's works for many years**.This will help members who have not so far gone thro his books and for the one who has already gone through, it will help to refresh.Few years back, Swami Chinmayananda was invited to a Ramana function and was asked to deliver his talk on Bhagavan Ramana.He did not deliver lecture and instead sat in silence forsome time and at the end told the audience that this is what bhagavan's teaching. **Bhagavan says that Silence is ever speaking and it is interrupted by speaking.Are we following his teachings?**  
You are absolutely correct. The best course is to simply maintain silence. I  
have always found the tamizh works of Ramana more clearer than any of the  
other languages, it may be because it is my mother tongue, but I did not know  
how to read or write tamizh, but due to Bhagavan's grace, I am learning to  
read and write tamizh now atleast I am able to read it slowly though.   
Personally, I feel, Bhagavan's teachings are to be discussed within the Self  
alone, in the course of enquiry itself and not outside. One has to taste the  
tea himself to know its taste, no matter what elaboration anybody gives, is  
going to be of no avail.   
It is due to the Vasana of finding out answers to our questions that breeds  
questions and endless discussions. Bhagavans says, we need not know any  
answers at all. We fail to recognise the very presence of Bhagavan Ramana, if  
he is not there physically, does it mean that he is not going to clear our  
questions within? its because of this wrong notion, that we begin to discuss  
our issues or questions and it leads to analyses over analyses. What we need  
is a strong belief or Faith or Shraddha that Bhagavan will clear all doubts  
Himself and I need not ask anybody and that He himself will reveal it to me in  
any way, maybe an unknown person would come and say something in some other  
context, or through some incidents. We just need to remain alive and keep the  
enquiry always going. Like how Dhathathreya had 24 Gurus, most of them being  
animals, in a similar way, Bhagavan will bestow on us the clarity in some way  
or the other.   
To ask doubts and discussing it is going outwards. We have to remain within  
our self - holding on just to 'I' alone.   
In Talks: 253: Bhagavan has said The illiterates are certainly better off than the  
literates whose egos are not destroyed by the quest of the self.   
355: "Illiteracy is ignorance: education is learned ignorance. Both of them  
are ignorant of their true aim; whereas a sage is not ignorant because there  
is no aim for him."   
D.: Mind itself is very subtle and is also the same as the Atman.   
How shall we know the nature of the mind? You have said that all   
supports are useless. What should be our stand then?   
M.: Where does your mind stand?   
D.: Where does it stand?   
M.: Ask the mind itself.   
D.: I ask you now. Should we concentrate on mind then?   
M.: Um!   
D.: But what is the nature of the mind? It is formless. The problem   
is perplexing.   
M.: Why are you perplexed?   
D.: The sastras want us to concentrate and I cannot do so.   
M.: Through what sastras have we known our existence?   
D.: It is a matter of experience. But I want to concentrate.   
M.: Be free from thoughts. Do not hold on to anything. They do not   
hold you. Be yourself.   
D.: I do not yet understand as to where I take my stand and concentrate.   
Can I meditate on my mind?   
M.: Whose mind?   
D.: My own mind?   
M.: Who are you? The question now resolves itself all right.   
(All retired for lunch. The visitor returned at 2-30 p.m. and pursued   
the same question.)   
He said: Maharshi advises the seeker to get rid of thoughts. On what   
should I concentrate the mind after all the thoughts are expelled? I   
do not see where I stand then and on what I should concentrate.   
M.: For whom is the concentration?   
D.: For the mind.   
M.: Then concentrate the mind.   
D.: On what?   
M.: Answer the question yourself. What is the mind? Why should   
you concentrate?   
D.: I do not know what the mind is. I ask Maharshi.   
M.: Maharshi does not seek to know the mind. The questioner must   
question the mind itself as to what it is.   
 **D.: Maharshi advises that the mind should be divested of thoughts.   
M.: This is itself a thought.**   
D.: When all thoughts disappear what remains over?   
M.: Is the mind different from thoughts?   
 **D.: No. The mind is made up of thoughts. My point is this: When all   
thoughts are got rid of, how shall I concentrate the mind?   
M.: Is not this also a thought?**   
D.: Yes, but I am advised to concentrate.   
M.: Why should you concentrate? Why should you not allow your   
thoughts free play?   
D.: The sastras say that the thoughts, thus playing free, lead us astray,   
that is, to unreal and changeful things.   
M.: So then, you want not to be led to unreal and changeful things. Your   
thoughts are unreal and changeful. You want to hold the Reality. That   
is exactly what I say. The thoughts are unreal. Get rid of them.   
 **D.: I understand now. Yet there is a doubt. Not a trice can you remain   
inactive. How shall I be able to rid myself of thoughts?   
M.: The same Gita says: Although all actions take place, I am not the doer.   
It is like the sun towards the world activities. The Self always remains   
actionless, whereas thoughts arise and subside. The Self is Perfection; it   
is immutable; the mind is limited and changeful. You need only to cast   
off your limitations. Your perfection thus stands revealed.**   
D.: Grace is necessary for it.   
 _ **M.: Grace is ever present. All that is necessary is that you surrender to  
It.**_   
D.: I surrender and pray that even if I go wrong I may be forcibly   
drawn to it.   
 **M.: Is this surrender? Surrender to be complete must be   
unquestioning.**   
D.: Yes, I surrender. You say I must dive into the ocean of the Self   
like a pearl-diver into the sea.   
M.: Because you are now thinking that you are out of the ocean of   
Consciousness.   
D.: I practise pranayama. It generates heat in the body. What should   
I do?   
M.: The heat will pass away when the mind gains calm   
D.: That is true but most difficult.   
 **M.: This is again a thought which is an obstacle.

Thought is an obstacle if i am moving in the thought world.   
how can thought obstruct the Self?   
how can a building obstruct the space?   
I am not saying Sri Ramana is wrong.   
i am just saying, the person who recorded it might not have done it all that  
well!

I agree with Udai agru.   
Even Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami also says the same thing.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Mano Nasam means only destruction of  
ignorance in the mind but not destruction of mind.   
If really problems solve by killing our mind then it can be solved by taking  
some injection like anaesthesia. :-)   
So solution is to know that we are not the mind and it is mithya i.e dependent  
on our real naturre i.e sat-chit-ananda.

Dear I,   
I would rather put it this way: When the glass tumbler is half filled with water. One says its half filled and  
the other says its half empty.   
Thats all is the difference.

The point is : mind cannot be killed, coz its never alive to be killed.   
like the snake on a rope. should the snake be killed?   
i am awareness, right now -- there is no choice here.   
and as awareness, i "CANNOT" get sad, happy or anything else. AS AWareness, i  
a Every STillness.   
so its not "Be Still" \-- u R STILLNESS. .. no choice here!   
so when someone says "I WILL BE STILL" thats foolish. As Awareness there is no  
choice. One is STILLNESS ITSELF.   
AS mind, one cannot remain still... coz mind by nature is unreal. mind cannot  
become SAT.   
So, here is the problem. People want the mind to be Still... body to stop  
growing!! how is it ever possible.   
body by its nature has to grow old. mind by its nature has to change. Self  
cannot Change.   
This is the essence.   
Swami Suddhananda gives a nice example: Someone was asked "What is ur age", he  
said "30". "But u said the same thing 10 years ago", asked another who was  
present there. "That is right, i tell the truth and truth cannot change", was  
his reply!   
what kind of truth is that??   
The attempt to stop the mirage like world from appearing is also a mistake.  
coz it shall continue as long as one's prarabdha is there unfinished. no one  
can stop it.   
Love!   
Silence

The very entity which also says that mind cannot be killed is mind itself.   
In the snake and rope example, snake is an illusion - Mithya and the rope is  
Asat.

Awareness is completely pure. Why is there a need to affirm that I am  
awareness? and to whom is this made?

yes. its mind that is saying.   
and that knowledge "u r awareness" is required for mind only.   
coz, the Self never needs this knowledge. Body cannot have it.   
Its very simple.   
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too?   
is not the instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for  
mind.   
MITHYA and ASAT have one basic difference. Mithya is like a mirage. it appears  
to be present, though its purely ASAT.   
So one cannot stop the appearance. it continues.

Dear I,   
In total agreement with your points, I would like to bring in my views in the  
same example quoted by you: Quote from: srkudai on June 28, 2010, 12:47:37 PM  
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too? is not the instruction "u r not this,  
but that which is outside", its for mind.   
Silence  
when the sage comes on the screen and says u are not this, you are not that  
and etc... and what ever you decide to do: 1 Stop the movie,   
2 continue the movie   
3 follow the sage   
4 not listen the sage   
5 do self enquiry   
6 letting the movie continue by allowing the assitant director to decide on  
the next scenarios believing that it cannot affect me, etc...   
these are still part of the movie itself. These are all the various courses  
the mind has, as options in the movie, as the director. These are "Freewill"  
which the i believes it has, which it can use to do what i wants to.   
Movie is in reality, not there at all, movie exist only for the mind alone  
which is non-self. In ignorance, the character itself, is the one which has  
created the movie and various scenarios and also the sage who comes and says  
you are not this you are that is just another character in the movie created  
by the mind again to make the movie more interesting, thats all.   
Once the character discards his dress knowing its limitedness - means there is  
no more i at all, no director at all, there is no more movie anymore. Movie  
existed only for the mithya i.   
The instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for mind." is  
itself just Mithya as well. It is just a story in the movie, which the i gets  
identified with whereby 'i' mistakenly takes these instruction for itself and  
begins to enquire who am i, I am the Self, I am this and I am that. these are  
all again just illusions. There is no need for self enquiry as well.   
There is no movie at all.   
Appearance is only for the 'i' mind alone. as long as the mind exists  
appearances will continue, as appearances are all the creations of the mind  
alone. Where there are no appearances and where only  
awareness/consciousness/Self alone IS, is real. _Where appearances still are_  
, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.

Dear Devotees,   
 I would like to share some of my views on various comments by forum members. Members comments are given in bold and my comments are in italics.   
1\. AWA is not Self enquiry since the moment the word watching is used, then  
the   
 subject object relation ship comes into picture and hence it cannot be the state of   
 BEING..Also how can awareness be watched?   
 _  
Comments: Mr. Michael Langford has mentioned that Awareness Watching  
Awareness is Awareness Being Awareness and he also says that because of long  
ancient habit of looking outwards towards people places and things, the word  
watching is used in practice instructions. Also he says that that way we take  
that same habit of watching people, places and things and we shut our eyes and  
turn it inwards. That is why the word watching is used. **Mr.Michael Langford  
says that what is real is awareness watching awareness, looking inward. What  
is unreal is looking outward towards the world of people places and things.  
Hence AWA is in line with Bjhagavans Self Enquiry   
**There are some comments in the forum that how can awareness be watched? If  
the word watching is inappropriate, then a doubt arises in mind how the  
word enquiry is appropriate in Self enquiry. When the word enquiry is used  
then doubt arises about who should enquire and whether self can be enquired  
and if self can be enquired then there must be enquirer similar to watcher in  
the word watching. All these doubts do not arise if tamil word SUMMA IRU is  
used to denote self enquiry**. Bhagavan ramana maharishi has instructed my  
mother around 80 years ago when she was a child that she should read  
Bhagavans works in the same language in which it was originally composed.I  
remember to have read some where that Bhagavan has given similar  
instructions to Annamalai Swami. Bhagavan has composed his great works such  
as   
 Nan Yar, Upadesa Undiar, Ulladhu Naarpathu,Arunachala Akshara mana malai etc  
in Tamil and when it is translated in other languages, it does not convey the  
same meaning as in tamil.. **In this context, I would like members to go  
through the commentary in English on Nan Yar by Mr.Michel James where in he  
uses the same original tamil words in many places in his commentary to  
ensure that the meaning is not distorted.**_   
[/b]   
2.As per AWA, it should be done on certain hours.   
 _Comments:Mr Michael Langford says that spend as many hours per day  
practicing as you can. **If you only practice awareness watching awareness for  
30 minutes per day and spend the other 23 and a half hours looking outward,  
you will not progress very quickly. If you want rapid results, then drop your  
unnecessary activities to free up time so you can practice for many hours per  
day, everyday. Maybe once per week on one of your days off from work you can  
devote the whole day to just practicing awareness watching awareness. Again  
this is in line with Bhagavans teachings that vichara should be done  
throughout the entire waking state   
**_ [/b]   
3.As per AWA, one should practice with eyes closed.   
 _Comments:To a question put to Bhagavan whether eyes should be open or not  
like this Bhagaan answers thus   
A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes it happens that when the eyes are  
closed the latent thoughts rush forth with great vigour. It may also be  
difficult to introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of  
mind to do so. The mind is contaminated when it takes in objects. Otherwise,  
it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind active in its own  
pursuit without taking in external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
 **From the very first sentence in Bhagavan s answer, it is evident that it  
may be done either way.**   
_   
4.As per AWA,ten methods are suggested and how can there be 10 methods since  
there is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being still.   
 _Comments: In Hinduism, four margas(paths) are prescribed for realization  
and devotees can follow any marga to reach the goal of Self realization. In  
Guru Ramana Mr.Cohen, quotes Bhagavan and says that the ultimate goal is  
realize the self and the paths are left to individuals. In fact, Bhagavan has  
told that Bakthi and Jnana are one and the same. In this context, I would like  
to quote an explanation given by late Paramacharya of Kanchi Mutt Sri  
Chandrasekara Saraswathi Swamigal. A devotee had a genuine doubt and asked  
Paramacharya why Paramacharya is confined to pujas and rituals and does not  
perform siddhis(miracles) like Sri. Sathya Sai Baba.. Paramacharya replied  
that the goal of his and Sri.Sathya Sa Baba are one and the same ie to bring  
everybody in to divinity and only difference is that they adopt different  
techniques like marketing people adopt different techniques to sell the goods.   
Bhagvan has given all the spiritual instructions very crystal clear and in  
simple language. In spite of that, during his life time, we can find devotees  
going on questioning about self enquiry again and again and this is evident  
if we go through the bookTalks wherein similar questions on self enquiry  
are repeated at number of places by different devotees. These devotees who put  
questions to hagavan are not ordinary layman but intellectuals and highly  
learned. **In order to cater to needs of people with different caliber,  
Micheal has given different methods and he is not suggested to follow all  
methods. It is left to individuals to follow the method which suits him  
best.This is in line with Bhagavan suggesting two methods ie doing sadhana  
with closed eyes and with open eyes. Which ever suits a devotee, he can follow  
it. Ultimately, the goal is to turn our attention inwards to the subject from  
objects.**   
 **All 10 methods suggested by Mr.Michael boils down to turning the  
attention inwards only and nothing else. Once a devotee becomes proficient in  
practice, he can practice sadhana eyes closed/open, one hour a day to 24  
hours a day,walking/sitting /laying/at rest room/ brushing his teeth. Only  
time he cannot do is while at sleep and when he is actively engaged in any  
work.When he is engaged in any serious activity, he automatically goes into  
meditation since his full attention is on that activity and there no  
thoughts**.   
**To conclude, I am fully convinced by Bhagavans teaching that at some  
point of time, we should forget what we have learned, stop reading books and  
turn our attention inwards. By mere reading various scriptures and endless  
discussion does not lead to realization unless we practice what we have  
learned.. To quote swami Sivananda of Rishikesh, an ounce of practice is  
better than tons of reading. In Sanskrit, it is known as Sravanam, mananam and  
Nithidyasanam and in Tirukkural, Tiruvallur says Karka Kashadara  
Karka.karrapin Nirka Thaga when means read and understand well and then  
practice what you have learnt. Do we[/b_**]?

It is the tendancy of our nature that we complicate things by not only our own  
analysis but also analysis of analyses itself.   
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
These are just tools for 'I' so that it can simply continue in the garb of  
spiritual enquiry and enjoy its existence. It does not at akk matter if  
awareness is watching awareness or awareness is not watching awareness,  
whether Ramana's teachings are same as Michal James or different, whether  
Bhakti yoga is same as Jnana Yoga or different. Whether my point is accepted  
here or rejected. whether the discussions is helping or not.   
'I' \- just hold on to it, everything else is play and only play: Merry-  
Go-Round   
Self Enquiry is like the passive observer. A classic example which Shankara  
Bhagavatpadal has given is that of the bird Dove which lays eggs and carefully  
guards it everyday and accumulates food for it from various places and when  
the eggs are going to hatch, one day the crow comes pushes the eggs down from  
the nest and eats all the eggs and just born dove. The dove, which comes there  
just sees all this without reaction. It just remains.   
Such should be our enquiry.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Here is the classic pic taken from the famous movie Adi Shankaracharya. Its  
one of the best examples as to how our enquiry has to be carried on: Crow and dove.Crow is the doer, the active one.The dove is the passive  
observer, the atman(inner self) - our attention should be always focussed only  
on this.   
instead of focusing our attention on the 'I', if the Dove begins to fight with  
the crow, it is only going to cause damage and loss of peace. Just remaining  
indifferent to what is happening, remaining in the world, carrying out our  
duties, we should remain like the Dove with our attention focused on the Self  
till our Prarabhha karma is dissolved.

Dear Mr.Nagaraj,   
 I agree with your comments as above.When we know that who am I is simply holding on to the "I", why so many posts in this forum on various headings on various topics?. **Bhagavan has given his first teaching "Naan Yar' crystal clear without any room for doubt and still do we require endless discussions on his teachings ?** **It is enough if only Bhagavan 's teachings alone are published in this site as being done by Sri Subramanian and Mr.Prasanth (Both of them are doing great service) and there are sufficient material for them to publish more of Bhagaan's works for many years**.This will help members who have not so far gone thro his books and for the one who has already gone through, it will help to refresh.Few years back, Swami Chinmayananda was invited to a Ramana function and was asked to deliver his talk on Bhagavan Ramana.He did not deliver lecture and instead sat in silence forsome time and at the end told the audience that this is what bhagavan's teaching. **Bhagavan says that Silence is ever speaking and it is interrupted by speaking.Are we following his teachings?

Dear viswanathan   
I agree with your detailed clarfifcations on the points of Michael   
Langford 'Awareness Watching Awareness'. The problems in   
any translation of the original work are that one has to compromise   
with some loss of beauty and cadence. A friend of mine, long time   
back, went to study Russian, to read Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace   
in original. But most of us cannot do that way. Why? Even Tamizhians today  
cannot properly read and understand classical   
Tamizh works like Bhagavan's ULLadu Narpadu. The untranslatatbility of Tamizh  
is quite high. In Tamizh, one often goes even without a verb. Nan Yaar means  
only "I Who" and not   
"Who am I?" Hence many problems have to be confronted by the   
translators. So long as Langford clarifies Watching means Being,   
then, as I already wrote, there is no problem. Even in Sanskrit,   
sometimes the word Darshan means not seeing but being. Siva darshan sometimes  
means Being Siva or Being in Sivam.   
As regards methods, again since every marga leads one ultimately to the one  
marga of self attention, there is no quarrel, in that sense.   
I also refer to Michael James as you have mentioned. He is the guy who read  
and mastered Tamizh while simultaneously venturing understanding and  
practicing Bhagavan Ramana's methods. Hence his books and translations are  
really of a higher order. In his   
Happiness and the Art of Being, he refers to ULLadu Narpadu   
verses and he always gives in italics the Tamizh word or phrases and again and  
again use many ways to describe the purport.   
Arunachala Siva.

OK   
How many of you tried "Awareness Watching Awareness" and found it different  
from Remaining as Self or Self inquiry?   
I tried it, and i see that its just the same. I do not find any difference.  
Whether one says, remain as Awareness within or Be Still, how does it matter?   
Its just the same!

You are absolutely correct. The best course is to simply maintain silence. I  
have always found the tamizh works of Ramana more clearer than any of the  
other languages, it may be because it is my mother tongue, but I did not know  
how to read or write tamizh, but due to Bhagavan's grace, I am learning to  
read and write tamizh now atleast I am able to read it slowly though.   
Personally, I feel, Bhagavan's teachings are to be discussed within the Self  
alone, in the course of enquiry itself and not outside. One has to taste the  
tea himself to know its taste, no matter what elaboration anybody gives, is  
going to be of no avail.   
It is due to the Vasana of finding out answers to our questions that breeds  
questions and endless discussions. Bhagavans says, we need not know any  
answers at all. We fail to recognise the very presence of Bhagavan Ramana, if  
he is not there physically, does it mean that he is not going to clear our  
questions within? its because of this wrong notion, that we begin to discuss  
our issues or questions and it leads to analyses over analyses. What we need  
is a strong belief or Faith or Shraddha that Bhagavan will clear all doubts  
Himself and I need not ask anybody and that He himself will reveal it to me in  
any way, maybe an unknown person would come and say something in some other  
context, or through some incidents. We just need to remain alive and keep the  
enquiry always going. Like how Dhathathreya had 24 Gurus, most of them being  
animals, in a similar way, Bhagavan will bestow on us the clarity in some way  
or the other.   
To ask doubts and discussing it is going outwards. We have to remain within  
our self - holding on just to 'I' alone.   
In Talks: 253: Bhagavan has said The illiterates are certainly better off than the  
literates whose egos are not destroyed by the quest of the self.   
355: "Illiteracy is ignorance: education is learned ignorance. Both of them  
are ignorant of their true aim; whereas a sage is not ignorant because there  
is no aim for him."   
D.: Mind itself is very subtle and is also the same as the Atman.   
How shall we know the nature of the mind? You have said that all   
supports are useless. What should be our stand then?   
M.: Where does your mind stand?   
D.: Where does it stand?   
M.: Ask the mind itself.   
D.: I ask you now. Should we concentrate on mind then?   
M.: Um!   
D.: But what is the nature of the mind? It is formless. The problem   
is perplexing.   
M.: Why are you perplexed?   
D.: The sastras want us to concentrate and I cannot do so.   
M.: Through what sastras have we known our existence?   
D.: It is a matter of experience. But I want to concentrate.   
M.: Be free from thoughts. Do not hold on to anything. They do not   
hold you. Be yourself.   
D.: I do not yet understand as to where I take my stand and concentrate.   
Can I meditate on my mind?   
M.: Whose mind?   
D.: My own mind?   
M.: Who are you? The question now resolves itself all right.   
(All retired for lunch. The visitor returned at 2-30 p.m. and pursued   
the same question.)   
He said: Maharshi advises the seeker to get rid of thoughts. On what   
should I concentrate the mind after all the thoughts are expelled? I   
do not see where I stand then and on what I should concentrate.   
M.: For whom is the concentration?   
D.: For the mind.   
M.: Then concentrate the mind.   
D.: On what?   
M.: Answer the question yourself. What is the mind? Why should   
you concentrate?   
D.: I do not know what the mind is. I ask Maharshi.   
M.: Maharshi does not seek to know the mind. The questioner must   
question the mind itself as to what it is.   
 **D.: Maharshi advises that the mind should be divested of thoughts.   
M.: This is itself a thought.**   
D.: When all thoughts disappear what remains over?   
M.: Is the mind different from thoughts?   
 **D.: No. The mind is made up of thoughts. My point is this: When all   
thoughts are got rid of, how shall I concentrate the mind?   
M.: Is not this also a thought?**   
D.: Yes, but I am advised to concentrate.   
M.: Why should you concentrate? Why should you not allow your   
thoughts free play?   
D.: The sastras say that the thoughts, thus playing free, lead us astray,   
that is, to unreal and changeful things.   
M.: So then, you want not to be led to unreal and changeful things. Your   
thoughts are unreal and changeful. You want to hold the Reality. That   
is exactly what I say. The thoughts are unreal. Get rid of them.   
 **D.: I understand now. Yet there is a doubt. Not a trice can you remain   
inactive. How shall I be able to rid myself of thoughts?   
M.: The same Gita says: Although all actions take place, I am not the doer.   
It is like the sun towards the world activities. The Self always remains   
actionless, whereas thoughts arise and subside. The Self is Perfection; it   
is immutable; the mind is limited and changeful. You need only to cast   
off your limitations. Your perfection thus stands revealed.**   
D.: Grace is necessary for it.   
 _ **M.: Grace is ever present. All that is necessary is that you surrender to  
It.**_   
D.: I surrender and pray that even if I go wrong I may be forcibly   
drawn to it.   
 **M.: Is this surrender? Surrender to be complete must be   
unquestioning.**   
D.: Yes, I surrender. You say I must dive into the ocean of the Self   
like a pearl-diver into the sea.   
M.: Because you are now thinking that you are out of the ocean of   
Consciousness.   
D.: I practise pranayama. It generates heat in the body. What should   
I do?   
M.: The heat will pass away when the mind gains calm   
D.: That is true but most difficult.   
 **M.: This is again a thought which is an obstacle.

I agree with Udai agru.   
Even Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami also says the same thing.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Mano Nasam means only destruction of  
ignorance in the mind but not destruction of mind.   
If really problems solve by killing our mind then it can be solved by taking  
some injection like anaesthesia. :-)   
So solution is to know that we are not the mind and it is mithya i.e dependent  
on our real naturre i.e sat-chit-ananda.

The point is : mind cannot be killed, coz its never alive to be killed.   
like the snake on a rope. should the snake be killed?   
i am awareness, right now -- there is no choice here.   
and as awareness, i "CANNOT" get sad, happy or anything else. AS AWareness, i  
a Every STillness.   
so its not "Be Still" \-- u R STILLNESS. .. no choice here!   
so when someone says "I WILL BE STILL" thats foolish. As Awareness there is no  
choice. One is STILLNESS ITSELF.   
AS mind, one cannot remain still... coz mind by nature is unreal. mind cannot  
become SAT.   
So, here is the problem. People want the mind to be Still... body to stop  
growing!! how is it ever possible.   
body by its nature has to grow old. mind by its nature has to change. Self  
cannot Change.   
This is the essence.   
Swami Suddhananda gives a nice example: Someone was asked "What is ur age", he  
said "30". "But u said the same thing 10 years ago", asked another who was  
present there. "That is right, i tell the truth and truth cannot change", was  
his reply!   
what kind of truth is that??   
The attempt to stop the mirage like world from appearing is also a mistake.  
coz it shall continue as long as one's prarabdha is there unfinished. no one  
can stop it.   
Love!

The very entity which also says that mind cannot be killed is mind itself.   
In the snake and rope example, snake is an illusion - Mithya and the rope is  
Asat.

Awareness is completely pure. Why is there a need to affirm that I am  
awareness? and to whom is this made?

yes. its mind that is saying.   
and that knowledge "u r awareness" is required for mind only.   
coz, the Self never needs this knowledge. Body cannot have it.   
Its very simple.   
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too?   
is not the instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for  
mind.   
MITHYA and ASAT have one basic difference. Mithya is like a mirage. it appears  
to be present, though its purely ASAT.   
So one cannot stop the appearance. it continues.

Dear I,   
In total agreement with your points, I would like to bring in my views in the  
same example quoted by you: Quote from: srkudai on June 28, 2010, 12:47:37 PM

when the sage comes on the screen and says u are not this, you are not that  
and etc... and what ever you decide to do: 1 Stop the movie,   
2 continue the movie   
3 follow the sage   
4 not listen the sage   
5 do self enquiry   
6 letting the movie continue by allowing the assitant director to decide on  
the next scenarios believing that it cannot affect me, etc...   
these are still part of the movie itself. These are all the various courses  
the mind has, as options in the movie, as the director. These are "Freewill"  
which the i believes it has, which it can use to do what i wants to.   
Movie is in reality, not there at all, movie exist only for the mind alone  
which is non-self. In ignorance, the character itself, is the one which has  
created the movie and various scenarios and also the sage who comes and says  
you are not this you are that is just another character in the movie created  
by the mind again to make the movie more interesting, thats all.   
Once the character discards his dress knowing its limitedness - means there is  
no more i at all, no director at all, there is no more movie anymore. Movie  
existed only for the mithya i.   
The instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for mind." is  
itself just Mithya as well. It is just a story in the movie, which the i gets  
identified with whereby 'i' mistakenly takes these instruction for itself and  
begins to enquire who am i, I am the Self, I am this and I am that. these are  
all again just illusions. There is no need for self enquiry as well.   
There is no movie at all.   
Appearance is only for the 'i' mind alone. as long as the mind exists  
appearances will continue, as appearances are all the creations of the mind  
alone. Where there are no appearances and where only  
awareness/consciousness/Self alone IS, is real. _Where appearances still are_  
, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Devotees,   
 I would like to share some of my views on various comments by forum members. Members comments are given in bold and my comments are in italics.   
1\. AWA is not Self enquiry since the moment the word watching is used, then  
the   
 subject object relation ship comes into picture and hence it cannot be the state of   
 BEING..Also how can awareness be watched?   
 _  
Comments: Mr. Michael Langford has mentioned that Awareness Watching  
Awareness is Awareness Being Awareness and he also says that because of long  
ancient habit of looking outwards towards people places and things, the word  
watching is used in practice instructions. Also he says that that way we take  
that same habit of watching people, places and things and we shut our eyes and  
turn it inwards. That is why the word watching is used. **Mr.Michael Langford  
says that what is real is awareness watching awareness, looking inward. What  
is unreal is looking outward towards the world of people places and things.  
Hence AWA is in line with Bjhagavans Self Enquiry   
**There are some comments in the forum that how can awareness be watched? If  
the word watching is inappropriate, then a doubt arises in mind how the  
word enquiry is appropriate in Self enquiry. When the word enquiry is used  
then doubt arises about who should enquire and whether self can be enquired  
and if self can be enquired then there must be enquirer similar to watcher in  
the word watching. All these doubts do not arise if tamil word SUMMA IRU is  
used to denote self enquiry**. Bhagavan ramana maharishi has instructed my  
mother around 80 years ago when she was a child that she should read  
Bhagavans works in the same language in which it was originally composed.I  
remember to have read some where that Bhagavan has given similar  
instructions to Annamalai Swami. Bhagavan has composed his great works such  
as   
 Nan Yar, Upadesa Undiar, Ulladhu Naarpathu,Arunachala Akshara mana malai etc  
in Tamil and when it is translated in other languages, it does not convey the  
same meaning as in tamil.. **In this context, I would like members to go  
through the commentary in English on Nan Yar by Mr.Michel James where in he  
uses the same original tamil words in many places in his commentary to  
ensure that the meaning is not distorted.**_   
[/b]   
2.As per AWA, it should be done on certain hours.   
 _Comments:Mr Michael Langford says that spend as many hours per day  
practicing as you can. **If you only practice awareness watching awareness for  
30 minutes per day and spend the other 23 and a half hours looking outward,  
you will not progress very quickly. If you want rapid results, then drop your  
unnecessary activities to free up time so you can practice for many hours per  
day, everyday. Maybe once per week on one of your days off from work you can  
devote the whole day to just practicing awareness watching awareness. Again  
this is in line with Bhagavans teachings that vichara should be done  
throughout the entire waking state   
**_ [/b]   
3.As per AWA, one should practice with eyes closed.   
 _Comments:To a question put to Bhagavan whether eyes should be open or not  
like this Bhagaan answers thus   
A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes it happens that when the eyes are  
closed the latent thoughts rush forth with great vigour. It may also be  
difficult to introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of  
mind to do so. The mind is contaminated when it takes in objects. Otherwise,  
it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind active in its own  
pursuit without taking in external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
 **From the very first sentence in Bhagavan s answer, it is evident that it  
may be done either way.**   
_   
4.As per AWA,ten methods are suggested and how can there be 10 methods since  
there is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being still.   
 _Comments: In Hinduism, four margas(paths) are prescribed for realization  
and devotees can follow any marga to reach the goal of Self realization. In  
Guru Ramana Mr.Cohen, quotes Bhagavan and says that the ultimate goal is  
realize the self and the paths are left to individuals. In fact, Bhagavan has  
told that Bakthi and Jnana are one and the same. In this context, I would like  
to quote an explanation given by late Paramacharya of Kanchi Mutt Sri  
Chandrasekara Saraswathi Swamigal. A devotee had a genuine doubt and asked  
Paramacharya why Paramacharya is confined to pujas and rituals and does not  
perform siddhis(miracles) like Sri. Sathya Sai Baba.. Paramacharya replied  
that the goal of his and Sri.Sathya Sa Baba are one and the same ie to bring  
everybody in to divinity and only difference is that they adopt different  
techniques like marketing people adopt different techniques to sell the goods.   
Bhagvan has given all the spiritual instructions very crystal clear and in  
simple language. In spite of that, during his life time, we can find devotees  
going on questioning about self enquiry again and again and this is evident  
if we go through the bookTalks wherein similar questions on self enquiry  
are repeated at number of places by different devotees. These devotees who put  
questions to hagavan are not ordinary layman but intellectuals and highly  
learned. **In order to cater to needs of people with different caliber,  
Micheal has given different methods and he is not suggested to follow all  
methods. It is left to individuals to follow the method which suits him  
best.This is in line with Bhagavan suggesting two methods ie doing sadhana  
with closed eyes and with open eyes. Which ever suits a devotee, he can follow  
it. Ultimately, the goal is to turn our attention inwards to the subject from  
objects.**   
 **All 10 methods suggested by Mr.Michael boils down to turning the  
attention inwards only and nothing else. Once a devotee becomes proficient in  
practice, he can practice sadhana eyes closed/open, one hour a day to 24  
hours a day,walking/sitting /laying/at rest room/ brushing his teeth. Only  
time he cannot do is while at sleep and when he is actively engaged in any  
work.When he is engaged in any serious activity, he automatically goes into  
meditation since his full attention is on that activity and there no  
thoughts**.   
**To conclude, I am fully convinced by Bhagavans teaching that at some  
point of time, we should forget what we have learned, stop reading books and  
turn our attention inwards. By mere reading various scriptures and endless  
discussion does not lead to realization unless we practice what we have  
learned.. To quote swami Sivananda of Rishikesh, an ounce of practice is  
better than tons of reading. In Sanskrit, it is known as Sravanam, mananam and  
Nithidyasanam and in Tirukkural, Tiruvallur says Karka Kashadara  
Karka.karrapin Nirka Thaga when means read and understand well and then  
practice what you have learnt. Do we[/b_**]?

It is the tendancy of our nature that we complicate things by not only our own  
analysis but also analysis of analyses itself.   
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
These are just tools for 'I' so that it can simply continue in the garb of  
spiritual enquiry and enjoy its existence. It does not at akk matter if  
awareness is watching awareness or awareness is not watching awareness,  
whether Ramana's teachings are same as Michal James or different, whether  
Bhakti yoga is same as Jnana Yoga or different. Whether my point is accepted  
here or rejected. whether the discussions is helping or not.   
'I' \- just hold on to it, everything else is play and only play: Merry-  
Go-Round   
Self Enquiry is like the passive observer. A classic example which Shankara  
Bhagavatpadal has given is that of the bird Dove which lays eggs and carefully  
guards it everyday and accumulates food for it from various places and when  
the eggs are going to hatch, one day the crow comes pushes the eggs down from  
the nest and eats all the eggs and just born dove. The dove, which comes there  
just sees all this without reaction. It just remains.   
Such should be our enquiry.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Here is the classic pic taken from the famous movie Adi Shankaracharya. Its  
one of the best examples as to how our enquiry has to be carried on: Crow and dove.Crow is the doer, the active one.The dove is the passive  
observer, the atman(inner self) - our attention should be always focussed only  
on this.   
instead of focusing our attention on the 'I', if the Dove begins to fight with  
the crow, it is only going to cause damage and loss of peace. Just remaining  
indifferent to what is happening, remaining in the world, carrying out our  
duties, we should remain like the Dove with our attention focused on the Self  
till our Prarabhha karma is dissolved.

Dear Mr.Nagaraj,   
 I agree with your comments as above.When we know that who am I is simply holding on to the "I", why so many posts in this forum on various headings on various topics?. **Bhagavan has given his first teaching "Naan Yar' crystal clear without any room for doubt and still do we require endless discussions on his teachings ?** **It is enough if only Bhagavan 's teachings alone are published in this site as being done by Sri Subramanian and Mr.Prasanth (Both of them are doing great service) and there are sufficient material for them to publish more of Bhagaan's works for many years**.This will help members who have not so far gone thro his books and for the one who has already gone through, it will help to refresh.Few years back, Swami Chinmayananda was invited to a Ramana function and was asked to deliver his talk on Bhagavan Ramana.He did not deliver lecture and instead sat in silence forsome time and at the end told the audience that this is what bhagavan's teaching. **Bhagavan says that Silence is ever speaking and it is interrupted by speaking.Are we following his teachings?

## Re:[34] Is 'Awareness Watching Awareness'-method same as Sri Bhagavan's Self- Attention?

Dear viswanathan   
I agree with your detailed clarfifcations on the points of Michael   
Langford 'Awareness Watching Awareness'. The problems in   
any translation of the original work are that one has to compromise   
with some loss of beauty and cadence. A friend of mine, long time   
back, went to study Russian, to read Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace   
in original. But most of us cannot do that way. Why? Even Tamizhians today  
cannot properly read and understand classical   
Tamizh works like Bhagavan's ULLadu Narpadu. The untranslatatbility of Tamizh  
is quite high. In Tamizh, one often goes even without a verb. Nan Yaar means  
only "I Who" and not   
"Who am I?" Hence many problems have to be confronted by the   
translators. So long as Langford clarifies Watching means Being,   
then, as I already wrote, there is no problem. Even in Sanskrit,   
sometimes the word Darshan means not seeing but being. Siva darshan sometimes  
means Being Siva or Being in Sivam.   
As regards methods, again since every marga leads one ultimately to the one  
marga of self attention, there is no quarrel, in that sense.   
I also refer to Michael James as you have mentioned. He is the guy who read  
and mastered Tamizh while simultaneously venturing understanding and  
practicing Bhagavan Ramana's methods. Hence his books and translations are  
really of a higher order. In his   
Happiness and the Art of Being, he refers to ULLadu Narpadu   
verses and he always gives in italics the Tamizh word or phrases and again and  
again use many ways to describe the purport.   
Arunachala Siva.

OK   
How many of you tried "Awareness Watching Awareness" and found it different  
from Remaining as Self or Self inquiry?   
I tried it, and i see that its just the same. I do not find any difference.  
Whether one says, remain as Awareness within or Be Still, how does it matter?   
Its just the same!

Dear I,   
Quote from: viswanathan on June 28, 2010, 03:16:39 AM  
 I agree with your comments as above.When we know that who am I is simply holding on to the "I", why so many posts in this forum on various headings on various topics?. **Bhagavan has given his first teaching "Naan Yar' crystal clear without any room for doubt and still do we require endless discussions on his teachings ?** **It is enough if only Bhagavan 's teachings alone are published in this site as being done by Sri Subramanian and Mr.Prasanth (Both of them are doing great service) and there are sufficient material for them to publish more of Bhagaan's works for many years**.This will help members who have not so far gone thro his books and for the one who has already gone through, it will help to refresh.Few years back, Swami Chinmayananda was invited to a Ramana function and was asked to deliver his talk on Bhagavan Ramana.He did not deliver lecture and instead sat in silence forsome time and at the end told the audience that this is what bhagavan's teaching. **Bhagavan says that Silence is ever speaking and it is interrupted by speaking.Are we following his teachings?**  
You are absolutely correct. The best course is to simply maintain silence. I  
have always found the tamizh works of Ramana more clearer than any of the  
other languages, it may be because it is my mother tongue, but I did not know  
how to read or write tamizh, but due to Bhagavan's grace, I am learning to  
read and write tamizh now atleast I am able to read it slowly though.   
Personally, I feel, Bhagavan's teachings are to be discussed within the Self  
alone, in the course of enquiry itself and not outside. One has to taste the  
tea himself to know its taste, no matter what elaboration anybody gives, is  
going to be of no avail.   
It is due to the Vasana of finding out answers to our questions that breeds  
questions and endless discussions. Bhagavans says, we need not know any  
answers at all. We fail to recognise the very presence of Bhagavan Ramana, if  
he is not there physically, does it mean that he is not going to clear our  
questions within? its because of this wrong notion, that we begin to discuss  
our issues or questions and it leads to analyses over analyses. What we need  
is a strong belief or Faith or Shraddha that Bhagavan will clear all doubts  
Himself and I need not ask anybody and that He himself will reveal it to me in  
any way, maybe an unknown person would come and say something in some other  
context, or through some incidents. We just need to remain alive and keep the  
enquiry always going. Like how Dhathathreya had 24 Gurus, most of them being  
animals, in a similar way, Bhagavan will bestow on us the clarity in some way  
or the other.   
To ask doubts and discussing it is going outwards. We have to remain within  
our self - holding on just to 'I' alone.   
In Talks: 253: Bhagavan has said The illiterates are certainly better off than the  
literates whose egos are not destroyed by the quest of the self.   
355: "Illiteracy is ignorance: education is learned ignorance. Both of them  
are ignorant of their true aim; whereas a sage is not ignorant because there  
is no aim for him."   
D.: Mind itself is very subtle and is also the same as the Atman.   
How shall we know the nature of the mind? You have said that all   
supports are useless. What should be our stand then?   
M.: Where does your mind stand?   
D.: Where does it stand?   
M.: Ask the mind itself.   
D.: I ask you now. Should we concentrate on mind then?   
M.: Um!   
D.: But what is the nature of the mind? It is formless. The problem   
is perplexing.   
M.: Why are you perplexed?   
D.: The sastras want us to concentrate and I cannot do so.   
M.: Through what sastras have we known our existence?   
D.: It is a matter of experience. But I want to concentrate.   
M.: Be free from thoughts. Do not hold on to anything. They do not   
hold you. Be yourself.   
D.: I do not yet understand as to where I take my stand and concentrate.   
Can I meditate on my mind?   
M.: Whose mind?   
D.: My own mind?   
M.: Who are you? The question now resolves itself all right.   
(All retired for lunch. The visitor returned at 2-30 p.m. and pursued   
the same question.)   
He said: Maharshi advises the seeker to get rid of thoughts. On what   
should I concentrate the mind after all the thoughts are expelled? I   
do not see where I stand then and on what I should concentrate.   
M.: For whom is the concentration?   
D.: For the mind.   
M.: Then concentrate the mind.   
D.: On what?   
M.: Answer the question yourself. What is the mind? Why should   
you concentrate?   
D.: I do not know what the mind is. I ask Maharshi.   
M.: Maharshi does not seek to know the mind. The questioner must   
question the mind itself as to what it is.   
 **D.: Maharshi advises that the mind should be divested of thoughts.   
M.: This is itself a thought.**   
D.: When all thoughts disappear what remains over?   
M.: Is the mind different from thoughts?   
 **D.: No. The mind is made up of thoughts. My point is this: When all   
thoughts are got rid of, how shall I concentrate the mind?   
M.: Is not this also a thought?**   
D.: Yes, but I am advised to concentrate.   
M.: Why should you concentrate? Why should you not allow your   
thoughts free play?   
D.: The sastras say that the thoughts, thus playing free, lead us astray,   
that is, to unreal and changeful things.   
M.: So then, you want not to be led to unreal and changeful things. Your   
thoughts are unreal and changeful. You want to hold the Reality. That   
is exactly what I say. The thoughts are unreal. Get rid of them.   
 **D.: I understand now. Yet there is a doubt. Not a trice can you remain   
inactive. How shall I be able to rid myself of thoughts?   
M.: The same Gita says: Although all actions take place, I am not the doer.   
It is like the sun towards the world activities. The Self always remains   
actionless, whereas thoughts arise and subside. The Self is Perfection; it   
is immutable; the mind is limited and changeful. You need only to cast   
off your limitations. Your perfection thus stands revealed.**   
D.: Grace is necessary for it.   
 _ **M.: Grace is ever present. All that is necessary is that you surrender to  
It.**_   
D.: I surrender and pray that even if I go wrong I may be forcibly   
drawn to it.   
 **M.: Is this surrender? Surrender to be complete must be   
unquestioning.**   
D.: Yes, I surrender. You say I must dive into the ocean of the Self   
like a pearl-diver into the sea.   
M.: Because you are now thinking that you are out of the ocean of   
Consciousness.   
D.: I practise pranayama. It generates heat in the body. What should   
I do?   
M.: The heat will pass away when the mind gains calm   
D.: That is true but most difficult.   
 **M.: This is again a thought which is an obstacle.

Thought is an obstacle if i am moving in the thought world.   
how can thought obstruct the Self?   
how can a building obstruct the space?   
I am not saying Sri Ramana is wrong.   
i am just saying, the person who recorded it might not have done it all that  
well!

I agree with Udai agru.   
Even Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami also says the same thing.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Mano Nasam means only destruction of  
ignorance in the mind but not destruction of mind.   
If really problems solve by killing our mind then it can be solved by taking  
some injection like anaesthesia. :-)   
So solution is to know that we are not the mind and it is mithya i.e dependent  
on our real naturre i.e sat-chit-ananda.

Dear I,   
I would rather put it this way: When the glass tumbler is half filled with water. One says its half filled and  
the other says its half empty.   
Thats all is the difference.

The point is : mind cannot be killed, coz its never alive to be killed.   
like the snake on a rope. should the snake be killed?   
i am awareness, right now -- there is no choice here.   
and as awareness, i "CANNOT" get sad, happy or anything else. AS AWareness, i  
a Every STillness.   
so its not "Be Still" \-- u R STILLNESS. .. no choice here!   
so when someone says "I WILL BE STILL" thats foolish. As Awareness there is no  
choice. One is STILLNESS ITSELF.   
AS mind, one cannot remain still... coz mind by nature is unreal. mind cannot  
become SAT.   
So, here is the problem. People want the mind to be Still... body to stop  
growing!! how is it ever possible.   
body by its nature has to grow old. mind by its nature has to change. Self  
cannot Change.   
This is the essence.   
Swami Suddhananda gives a nice example: Someone was asked "What is ur age", he  
said "30". "But u said the same thing 10 years ago", asked another who was  
present there. "That is right, i tell the truth and truth cannot change", was  
his reply!   
what kind of truth is that??   
The attempt to stop the mirage like world from appearing is also a mistake.  
coz it shall continue as long as one's prarabdha is there unfinished. no one  
can stop it.   
Love!   
Silence

The very entity which also says that mind cannot be killed is mind itself.   
In the snake and rope example, snake is an illusion - Mithya and the rope is  
Asat.

Awareness is completely pure. Why is there a need to affirm that I am  
awareness? and to whom is this made?

yes. its mind that is saying.   
and that knowledge "u r awareness" is required for mind only.   
coz, the Self never needs this knowledge. Body cannot have it.   
Its very simple.   
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too?   
is not the instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for  
mind.   
MITHYA and ASAT have one basic difference. Mithya is like a mirage. it appears  
to be present, though its purely ASAT.   
So one cannot stop the appearance. it continues.

Dear I,   
In total agreement with your points, I would like to bring in my views in the  
same example quoted by you: Quote from: srkudai on June 28, 2010, 12:47:37 PM  
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too? is not the instruction "u r not this,  
but that which is outside", its for mind.   
Silence  
when the sage comes on the screen and says u are not this, you are not that  
and etc... and what ever you decide to do: 1 Stop the movie,   
2 continue the movie   
3 follow the sage   
4 not listen the sage   
5 do self enquiry   
6 letting the movie continue by allowing the assitant director to decide on  
the next scenarios believing that it cannot affect me, etc...   
these are still part of the movie itself. These are all the various courses  
the mind has, as options in the movie, as the director. These are "Freewill"  
which the i believes it has, which it can use to do what i wants to.   
Movie is in reality, not there at all, movie exist only for the mind alone  
which is non-self. In ignorance, the character itself, is the one which has  
created the movie and various scenarios and also the sage who comes and says  
you are not this you are that is just another character in the movie created  
by the mind again to make the movie more interesting, thats all.   
Once the character discards his dress knowing its limitedness - means there is  
no more i at all, no director at all, there is no more movie anymore. Movie  
existed only for the mithya i.   
The instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for mind." is  
itself just Mithya as well. It is just a story in the movie, which the i gets  
identified with whereby 'i' mistakenly takes these instruction for itself and  
begins to enquire who am i, I am the Self, I am this and I am that. these are  
all again just illusions. There is no need for self enquiry as well.   
There is no movie at all.   
Appearance is only for the 'i' mind alone. as long as the mind exists  
appearances will continue, as appearances are all the creations of the mind  
alone. Where there are no appearances and where only  
awareness/consciousness/Self alone IS, is real. _Where appearances still are_  
, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.

Dear Devotees,   
 I would like to share some of my views on various comments by forum members. Members comments are given in bold and my comments are in italics.   
1\. AWA is not Self enquiry since the moment the word watching is used, then  
the   
 subject object relation ship comes into picture and hence it cannot be the state of   
 BEING..Also how can awareness be watched?   
 _  
Comments: Mr. Michael Langford has mentioned that Awareness Watching  
Awareness is Awareness Being Awareness and he also says that because of long  
ancient habit of looking outwards towards people places and things, the word  
watching is used in practice instructions. Also he says that that way we take  
that same habit of watching people, places and things and we shut our eyes and  
turn it inwards. That is why the word watching is used. **Mr.Michael Langford  
says that what is real is awareness watching awareness, looking inward. What  
is unreal is looking outward towards the world of people places and things.  
Hence AWA is in line with Bjhagavans Self Enquiry   
**There are some comments in the forum that how can awareness be watched? If  
the word watching is inappropriate, then a doubt arises in mind how the  
word enquiry is appropriate in Self enquiry. When the word enquiry is used  
then doubt arises about who should enquire and whether self can be enquired  
and if self can be enquired then there must be enquirer similar to watcher in  
the word watching. All these doubts do not arise if tamil word SUMMA IRU is  
used to denote self enquiry**. Bhagavan ramana maharishi has instructed my  
mother around 80 years ago when she was a child that she should read  
Bhagavans works in the same language in which it was originally composed.I  
remember to have read some where that Bhagavan has given similar  
instructions to Annamalai Swami. Bhagavan has composed his great works such  
as   
 Nan Yar, Upadesa Undiar, Ulladhu Naarpathu,Arunachala Akshara mana malai etc  
in Tamil and when it is translated in other languages, it does not convey the  
same meaning as in tamil.. **In this context, I would like members to go  
through the commentary in English on Nan Yar by Mr.Michel James where in he  
uses the same original tamil words in many places in his commentary to  
ensure that the meaning is not distorted.**_   
[/b]   
2.As per AWA, it should be done on certain hours.   
 _Comments:Mr Michael Langford says that spend as many hours per day  
practicing as you can. **If you only practice awareness watching awareness for  
30 minutes per day and spend the other 23 and a half hours looking outward,  
you will not progress very quickly. If you want rapid results, then drop your  
unnecessary activities to free up time so you can practice for many hours per  
day, everyday. Maybe once per week on one of your days off from work you can  
devote the whole day to just practicing awareness watching awareness. Again  
this is in line with Bhagavans teachings that vichara should be done  
throughout the entire waking state   
**_ [/b]   
3.As per AWA, one should practice with eyes closed.   
 _Comments:To a question put to Bhagavan whether eyes should be open or not  
like this Bhagaan answers thus   
A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes it happens that when the eyes are  
closed the latent thoughts rush forth with great vigour. It may also be  
difficult to introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of  
mind to do so. The mind is contaminated when it takes in objects. Otherwise,  
it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind active in its own  
pursuit without taking in external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
 **From the very first sentence in Bhagavan s answer, it is evident that it  
may be done either way.**   
_   
4.As per AWA,ten methods are suggested and how can there be 10 methods since  
there is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being still.   
 _Comments: In Hinduism, four margas(paths) are prescribed for realization  
and devotees can follow any marga to reach the goal of Self realization. In  
Guru Ramana Mr.Cohen, quotes Bhagavan and says that the ultimate goal is  
realize the self and the paths are left to individuals. In fact, Bhagavan has  
told that Bakthi and Jnana are one and the same. In this context, I would like  
to quote an explanation given by late Paramacharya of Kanchi Mutt Sri  
Chandrasekara Saraswathi Swamigal. A devotee had a genuine doubt and asked  
Paramacharya why Paramacharya is confined to pujas and rituals and does not  
perform siddhis(miracles) like Sri. Sathya Sai Baba.. Paramacharya replied  
that the goal of his and Sri.Sathya Sa Baba are one and the same ie to bring  
everybody in to divinity and only difference is that they adopt different  
techniques like marketing people adopt different techniques to sell the goods.   
Bhagvan has given all the spiritual instructions very crystal clear and in  
simple language. In spite of that, during his life time, we can find devotees  
going on questioning about self enquiry again and again and this is evident  
if we go through the bookTalks wherein similar questions on self enquiry  
are repeated at number of places by different devotees. These devotees who put  
questions to hagavan are not ordinary layman but intellectuals and highly  
learned. **In order to cater to needs of people with different caliber,  
Micheal has given different methods and he is not suggested to follow all  
methods. It is left to individuals to follow the method which suits him  
best.This is in line with Bhagavan suggesting two methods ie doing sadhana  
with closed eyes and with open eyes. Which ever suits a devotee, he can follow  
it. Ultimately, the goal is to turn our attention inwards to the subject from  
objects.**   
 **All 10 methods suggested by Mr.Michael boils down to turning the  
attention inwards only and nothing else. Once a devotee becomes proficient in  
practice, he can practice sadhana eyes closed/open, one hour a day to 24  
hours a day,walking/sitting /laying/at rest room/ brushing his teeth. Only  
time he cannot do is while at sleep and when he is actively engaged in any  
work.When he is engaged in any serious activity, he automatically goes into  
meditation since his full attention is on that activity and there no  
thoughts**.   
**To conclude, I am fully convinced by Bhagavans teaching that at some  
point of time, we should forget what we have learned, stop reading books and  
turn our attention inwards. By mere reading various scriptures and endless  
discussion does not lead to realization unless we practice what we have  
learned.. To quote swami Sivananda of Rishikesh, an ounce of practice is  
better than tons of reading. In Sanskrit, it is known as Sravanam, mananam and  
Nithidyasanam and in Tirukkural, Tiruvallur says Karka Kashadara  
Karka.karrapin Nirka Thaga when means read and understand well and then  
practice what you have learnt. Do we[/b_**]?

It is the tendancy of our nature that we complicate things by not only our own  
analysis but also analysis of analyses itself.   
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
These are just tools for 'I' so that it can simply continue in the garb of  
spiritual enquiry and enjoy its existence. It does not at akk matter if  
awareness is watching awareness or awareness is not watching awareness,  
whether Ramana's teachings are same as Michal James or different, whether  
Bhakti yoga is same as Jnana Yoga or different. Whether my point is accepted  
here or rejected. whether the discussions is helping or not.   
'I' \- just hold on to it, everything else is play and only play: Merry-  
Go-Round   
Self Enquiry is like the passive observer. A classic example which Shankara  
Bhagavatpadal has given is that of the bird Dove which lays eggs and carefully  
guards it everyday and accumulates food for it from various places and when  
the eggs are going to hatch, one day the crow comes pushes the eggs down from  
the nest and eats all the eggs and just born dove. The dove, which comes there  
just sees all this without reaction. It just remains.   
Such should be our enquiry.

Here is the classic pic taken from the famous movie Adi Shankaracharya. Its  
one of the best examples as to how our enquiry has to be carried on: Crow and dove.Crow is the doer, the active one.The dove is the passive  
observer, the atman(inner self) - our attention should be always focussed only  
on this.   
instead of focusing our attention on the 'I', if the Dove begins to fight with  
the crow, it is only going to cause damage and loss of peace. Just remaining  
indifferent to what is happening, remaining in the world, carrying out our  
duties, we should remain like the Dove with our attention focused on the Self  
till our Prarabhha karma is dissolved.

Dear Mr.Nagaraj,   
 I agree with your comments as above.When we know that who am I is simply holding on to the "I", why so many posts in this forum on various headings on various topics?. **Bhagavan has given his first teaching "Naan Yar' crystal clear without any room for doubt and still do we require endless discussions on his teachings ?** **It is enough if only Bhagavan 's teachings alone are published in this site as being done by Sri Subramanian and Mr.Prasanth (Both of them are doing great service) and there are sufficient material for them to publish more of Bhagaan's works for many years**.This will help members who have not so far gone thro his books and for the one who has already gone through, it will help to refresh.Few years back, Swami Chinmayananda was invited to a Ramana function and was asked to deliver his talk on Bhagavan Ramana.He did not deliver lecture and instead sat in silence forsome time and at the end told the audience that this is what bhagavan's teaching. **Bhagavan says that Silence is ever speaking and it is interrupted by speaking.Are we following his teachings?

Dear viswanathan   
I agree with your detailed clarfifcations on the points of Michael   
Langford 'Awareness Watching Awareness'. The problems in   
any translation of the original work are that one has to compromise   
with some loss of beauty and cadence. A friend of mine, long time   
back, went to study Russian, to read Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace   
in original. But most of us cannot do that way. Why? Even Tamizhians today  
cannot properly read and understand classical   
Tamizh works like Bhagavan's ULLadu Narpadu. The untranslatatbility of Tamizh  
is quite high. In Tamizh, one often goes even without a verb. Nan Yaar means  
only "I Who" and not   
"Who am I?" Hence many problems have to be confronted by the   
translators. So long as Langford clarifies Watching means Being,   
then, as I already wrote, there is no problem. Even in Sanskrit,   
sometimes the word Darshan means not seeing but being. Siva darshan sometimes  
means Being Siva or Being in Sivam.   
As regards methods, again since every marga leads one ultimately to the one  
marga of self attention, there is no quarrel, in that sense.   
I also refer to Michael James as you have mentioned. He is the guy who read  
and mastered Tamizh while simultaneously venturing understanding and  
practicing Bhagavan Ramana's methods. Hence his books and translations are  
really of a higher order. In his   
Happiness and the Art of Being, he refers to ULLadu Narpadu   
verses and he always gives in italics the Tamizh word or phrases and again and  
again use many ways to describe the purport.   
Arunachala Siva.

OK   
How many of you tried "Awareness Watching Awareness" and found it different  
from Remaining as Self or Self inquiry?   
I tried it, and i see that its just the same. I do not find any difference.  
Whether one says, remain as Awareness within or Be Still, how does it matter?   
Its just the same!

Dear I,   
Quote from: viswanathan on June 28, 2010, 03:16:39 AM  
 I agree with your comments as above.When we know that who am I is simply holding on to the "I", why so many posts in this forum on various headings on various topics?. **Bhagavan has given his first teaching "Naan Yar' crystal clear without any room for doubt and still do we require endless discussions on his teachings ?** **It is enough if only Bhagavan 's teachings alone are published in this site as being done by Sri Subramanian and Mr.Prasanth (Both of them are doing great service) and there are sufficient material for them to publish more of Bhagaan's works for many years**.This will help members who have not so far gone thro his books and for the one who has already gone through, it will help to refresh.Few years back, Swami Chinmayananda was invited to a Ramana function and was asked to deliver his talk on Bhagavan Ramana.He did not deliver lecture and instead sat in silence forsome time and at the end told the audience that this is what bhagavan's teaching. **Bhagavan says that Silence is ever speaking and it is interrupted by speaking.Are we following his teachings?**  
You are absolutely correct. The best course is to simply maintain silence. I  
have always found the tamizh works of Ramana more clearer than any of the  
other languages, it may be because it is my mother tongue, but I did not know  
how to read or write tamizh, but due to Bhagavan's grace, I am learning to  
read and write tamizh now atleast I am able to read it slowly though.   
Personally, I feel, Bhagavan's teachings are to be discussed within the Self  
alone, in the course of enquiry itself and not outside. One has to taste the  
tea himself to know its taste, no matter what elaboration anybody gives, is  
going to be of no avail.   
It is due to the Vasana of finding out answers to our questions that breeds  
questions and endless discussions. Bhagavans says, we need not know any  
answers at all. We fail to recognise the very presence of Bhagavan Ramana, if  
he is not there physically, does it mean that he is not going to clear our  
questions within? its because of this wrong notion, that we begin to discuss  
our issues or questions and it leads to analyses over analyses. What we need  
is a strong belief or Faith or Shraddha that Bhagavan will clear all doubts  
Himself and I need not ask anybody and that He himself will reveal it to me in  
any way, maybe an unknown person would come and say something in some other  
context, or through some incidents. We just need to remain alive and keep the  
enquiry always going. Like how Dhathathreya had 24 Gurus, most of them being  
animals, in a similar way, Bhagavan will bestow on us the clarity in some way  
or the other.   
To ask doubts and discussing it is going outwards. We have to remain within  
our self - holding on just to 'I' alone.   
In Talks: 253: Bhagavan has said The illiterates are certainly better off than the  
literates whose egos are not destroyed by the quest of the self.   
355: "Illiteracy is ignorance: education is learned ignorance. Both of them  
are ignorant of their true aim; whereas a sage is not ignorant because there  
is no aim for him."   
D.: Mind itself is very subtle and is also the same as the Atman.   
How shall we know the nature of the mind? You have said that all   
supports are useless. What should be our stand then?   
M.: Where does your mind stand?   
D.: Where does it stand?   
M.: Ask the mind itself.   
D.: I ask you now. Should we concentrate on mind then?   
M.: Um!   
D.: But what is the nature of the mind? It is formless. The problem   
is perplexing.   
M.: Why are you perplexed?   
D.: The sastras want us to concentrate and I cannot do so.   
M.: Through what sastras have we known our existence?   
D.: It is a matter of experience. But I want to concentrate.   
M.: Be free from thoughts. Do not hold on to anything. They do not   
hold you. Be yourself.   
D.: I do not yet understand as to where I take my stand and concentrate.   
Can I meditate on my mind?   
M.: Whose mind?   
D.: My own mind?   
M.: Who are you? The question now resolves itself all right.   
(All retired for lunch. The visitor returned at 2-30 p.m. and pursued   
the same question.)   
He said: Maharshi advises the seeker to get rid of thoughts. On what   
should I concentrate the mind after all the thoughts are expelled? I   
do not see where I stand then and on what I should concentrate.   
M.: For whom is the concentration?   
D.: For the mind.   
M.: Then concentrate the mind.   
D.: On what?   
M.: Answer the question yourself. What is the mind? Why should   
you concentrate?   
D.: I do not know what the mind is. I ask Maharshi.   
M.: Maharshi does not seek to know the mind. The questioner must   
question the mind itself as to what it is.   
 **D.: Maharshi advises that the mind should be divested of thoughts.   
M.: This is itself a thought.**   
D.: When all thoughts disappear what remains over?   
M.: Is the mind different from thoughts?   
 **D.: No. The mind is made up of thoughts. My point is this: When all   
thoughts are got rid of, how shall I concentrate the mind?   
M.: Is not this also a thought?**   
D.: Yes, but I am advised to concentrate.   
M.: Why should you concentrate? Why should you not allow your   
thoughts free play?   
D.: The sastras say that the thoughts, thus playing free, lead us astray,   
that is, to unreal and changeful things.   
M.: So then, you want not to be led to unreal and changeful things. Your   
thoughts are unreal and changeful. You want to hold the Reality. That   
is exactly what I say. The thoughts are unreal. Get rid of them.   
 **D.: I understand now. Yet there is a doubt. Not a trice can you remain   
inactive. How shall I be able to rid myself of thoughts?   
M.: The same Gita says: Although all actions take place, I am not the doer.   
It is like the sun towards the world activities. The Self always remains   
actionless, whereas thoughts arise and subside. The Self is Perfection; it   
is immutable; the mind is limited and changeful. You need only to cast   
off your limitations. Your perfection thus stands revealed.**   
D.: Grace is necessary for it.   
 _ **M.: Grace is ever present. All that is necessary is that you surrender to  
It.**_   
D.: I surrender and pray that even if I go wrong I may be forcibly   
drawn to it.   
 **M.: Is this surrender? Surrender to be complete must be   
unquestioning.**   
D.: Yes, I surrender. You say I must dive into the ocean of the Self   
like a pearl-diver into the sea.   
M.: Because you are now thinking that you are out of the ocean of   
Consciousness.   
D.: I practise pranayama. It generates heat in the body. What should   
I do?   
M.: The heat will pass away when the mind gains calm   
D.: That is true but most difficult.   
 **M.: This is again a thought which is an obstacle.

Thought is an obstacle if i am moving in the thought world.   
how can thought obstruct the Self?   
how can a building obstruct the space?   
I am not saying Sri Ramana is wrong.   
i am just saying, the person who recorded it might not have done it all that

I agree with Udai agru.   
Even Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami also says the same thing.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Mano Nasam means only destruction of  
ignorance in the mind but not destruction of mind.   
If really problems solve by killing our mind then it can be solved by taking  
some injection like anaesthesia. :-)   
So solution is to know that we are not the mind and it is mithya i.e dependent  
on our real naturre i.e sat-chit-ananda.

the other says its half empty.   
Thats all is the difference.

The point is : mind cannot be killed, coz its never alive to be killed.   
like the snake on a rope. should the snake be killed?   
i am awareness, right now -- there is no choice here.   
and as awareness, i "CANNOT" get sad, happy or anything else. AS AWareness, i  
a Every STillness.   
so its not "Be Still" \-- u R STILLNESS. .. no choice here!   
so when someone says "I WILL BE STILL" thats foolish. As Awareness there is no  
choice. One is STILLNESS ITSELF.   
AS mind, one cannot remain still... coz mind by nature is unreal. mind cannot  
become SAT.   
So, here is the problem. People want the mind to be Still... body to stop  
growing!! how is it ever possible.   
body by its nature has to grow old. mind by its nature has to change. Self  
cannot Change.   
This is the essence.   
Swami Suddhananda gives a nice example: Someone was asked "What is ur age", he  
said "30". "But u said the same thing 10 years ago", asked another who was  
present there. "That is right, i tell the truth and truth cannot change", was  
his reply!   
what kind of truth is that??   
The attempt to stop the mirage like world from appearing is also a mistake.  
coz it shall continue as long as one's prarabdha is there unfinished. no one  
can stop it.   
Love!   
Silence

The very entity which also says that mind cannot be killed is mind itself.   
In the snake and rope example, snake is an illusion - Mithya and the rope is  
Asat.

Awareness is completely pure. Why is there a need to affirm that I am  
awareness? and to whom is this made?

yes. its mind that is saying.   
and that knowledge "u r awareness" is required for mind only.   
coz, the Self never needs this knowledge. Body cannot have it.   
Its very simple.   
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too?   
is not the instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for  
mind.   
MITHYA and ASAT have one basic difference. Mithya is like a mirage. it appears  
to be present, though its purely ASAT.   
So one cannot stop the appearance. it continues.

Dear I,   
In total agreement with your points, I would like to bring in my views in the  
same example quoted by you: Quote from: srkudai on June 28, 2010, 12:47:37 PM  
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too? is not the instruction "u r not this,  
but that which is outside", its for mind.   
Silence  
when the sage comes on the screen and says u are not this, you are not that  
and etc... and what ever you decide to do: 1 Stop the movie,   
2 continue the movie   
3 follow the sage   
4 not listen the sage   
5 do self enquiry   
6 letting the movie continue by allowing the assitant director to decide on  
the next scenarios believing that it cannot affect me, etc...   
these are still part of the movie itself. These are all the various courses  
the mind has, as options in the movie, as the director. These are "Freewill"  
which the i believes it has, which it can use to do what i wants to.   
Movie is in reality, not there at all, movie exist only for the mind alone  
which is non-self. In ignorance, the character itself, is the one which has  
created the movie and various scenarios and also the sage who comes and says  
you are not this you are that is just another character in the movie created  
by the mind again to make the movie more interesting, thats all.   
Once the character discards his dress knowing its limitedness - means there is  
no more i at all, no director at all, there is no more movie anymore. Movie  
existed only for the mithya i.   
The instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for mind." is  
itself just Mithya as well. It is just a story in the movie, which the i gets  
identified with whereby 'i' mistakenly takes these instruction for itself and  
begins to enquire who am i, I am the Self, I am this and I am that. these are  
all again just illusions. There is no need for self enquiry as well.   
There is no movie at all.   
Appearance is only for the 'i' mind alone. as long as the mind exists  
appearances will continue, as appearances are all the creations of the mind  
alone. Where there are no appearances and where only  
awareness/consciousness/Self alone IS, is real. _Where appearances still are_  
, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.

Dear Devotees,   
 I would like to share some of my views on various comments by forum members. Members comments are given in bold and my comments are in italics.   
1\. AWA is not Self enquiry since the moment the word watching is used, then  
the   
 subject object relation ship comes into picture and hence it cannot be the state of   
 BEING..Also how can awareness be watched?   
 _  
Comments: Mr. Michael Langford has mentioned that Awareness Watching  
Awareness is Awareness Being Awareness and he also says that because of long  
ancient habit of looking outwards towards people places and things, the word  
watching is used in practice instructions. Also he says that that way we take  
that same habit of watching people, places and things and we shut our eyes and  
turn it inwards. That is why the word watching is used. **Mr.Michael Langford  
says that what is real is awareness watching awareness, looking inward. What  
is unreal is looking outward towards the world of people places and things.  
Hence AWA is in line with Bjhagavans Self Enquiry   
**There are some comments in the forum that how can awareness be watched? If  
the word watching is inappropriate, then a doubt arises in mind how the  
word enquiry is appropriate in Self enquiry. When the word enquiry is used  
then doubt arises about who should enquire and whether self can be enquired  
and if self can be enquired then there must be enquirer similar to watcher in  
the word watching. All these doubts do not arise if tamil word SUMMA IRU is  
used to denote self enquiry**. Bhagavan ramana maharishi has instructed my  
mother around 80 years ago when she was a child that she should read  
Bhagavans works in the same language in which it was originally composed.I  
remember to have read some where that Bhagavan has given similar  
instructions to Annamalai Swami. Bhagavan has composed his great works such  
as   
 Nan Yar, Upadesa Undiar, Ulladhu Naarpathu,Arunachala Akshara mana malai etc  
in Tamil and when it is translated in other languages, it does not convey the  
same meaning as in tamil.. **In this context, I would like members to go  
through the commentary in English on Nan Yar by Mr.Michel James where in he  
uses the same original tamil words in many places in his commentary to  
ensure that the meaning is not distorted.**_   
[/b]   
2.As per AWA, it should be done on certain hours.   
 _Comments:Mr Michael Langford says that spend as many hours per day  
practicing as you can. **If you only practice awareness watching awareness for  
30 minutes per day and spend the other 23 and a half hours looking outward,  
you will not progress very quickly. If you want rapid results, then drop your  
unnecessary activities to free up time so you can practice for many hours per  
day, everyday. Maybe once per week on one of your days off from work you can  
devote the whole day to just practicing awareness watching awareness. Again  
this is in line with Bhagavans teachings that vichara should be done  
throughout the entire waking state   
**_ [/b]   
3.As per AWA, one should practice with eyes closed.   
 _Comments:To a question put to Bhagavan whether eyes should be open or not  
like this Bhagaan answers thus   
A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes it happens that when the eyes are  
closed the latent thoughts rush forth with great vigour. It may also be  
difficult to introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of  
mind to do so. The mind is contaminated when it takes in objects. Otherwise,  
it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind active in its own  
pursuit without taking in external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
 **From the very first sentence in Bhagavan s answer, it is evident that it  
may be done either way.**   
_   
4.As per AWA,ten methods are suggested and how can there be 10 methods since  
there is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being still.   
 _Comments: In Hinduism, four margas(paths) are prescribed for realization  
and devotees can follow any marga to reach the goal of Self realization. In  
Guru Ramana Mr.Cohen, quotes Bhagavan and says that the ultimate goal is  
realize the self and the paths are left to individuals. In fact, Bhagavan has  
told that Bakthi and Jnana are one and the same. In this context, I would like  
to quote an explanation given by late Paramacharya of Kanchi Mutt Sri  
Chandrasekara Saraswathi Swamigal. A devotee had a genuine doubt and asked  
Paramacharya why Paramacharya is confined to pujas and rituals and does not  
perform siddhis(miracles) like Sri. Sathya Sai Baba.. Paramacharya replied  
that the goal of his and Sri.Sathya Sa Baba are one and the same ie to bring  
everybody in to divinity and only difference is that they adopt different  
techniques like marketing people adopt different techniques to sell the goods.   
Bhagvan has given all the spiritual instructions very crystal clear and in  
simple language. In spite of that, during his life time, we can find devotees  
going on questioning about self enquiry again and again and this is evident  
if we go through the bookTalks wherein similar questions on self enquiry  
are repeated at number of places by different devotees. These devotees who put  
questions to hagavan are not ordinary layman but intellectuals and highly  
learned. **In order to cater to needs of people with different caliber,  
Micheal has given different methods and he is not suggested to follow all  
methods. It is left to individuals to follow the method which suits him  
best.This is in line with Bhagavan suggesting two methods ie doing sadhana  
with closed eyes and with open eyes. Which ever suits a devotee, he can follow  
it. Ultimately, the goal is to turn our attention inwards to the subject from  
objects.**   
 **All 10 methods suggested by Mr.Michael boils down to turning the  
attention inwards only and nothing else. Once a devotee becomes proficient in  
practice, he can practice sadhana eyes closed/open, one hour a day to 24  
hours a day,walking/sitting /laying/at rest room/ brushing his teeth. Only  
time he cannot do is while at sleep and when he is actively engaged in any  
work.When he is engaged in any serious activity, he automatically goes into  
meditation since his full attention is on that activity and there no  
thoughts**.   
**To conclude, I am fully convinced by Bhagavans teaching that at some  
point of time, we should forget what we have learned, stop reading books and  
turn our attention inwards. By mere reading various scriptures and endless  
discussion does not lead to realization unless we practice what we have  
learned.. To quote swami Sivananda of Rishikesh, an ounce of practice is  
better than tons of reading. In Sanskrit, it is known as Sravanam, mananam and  
Nithidyasanam and in Tirukkural, Tiruvallur says Karka Kashadara  
Karka.karrapin Nirka Thaga when means read and understand well and then  
practice what you have learnt. Do we[/b_**]?

It is the tendancy of our nature that we complicate things by not only our own  
analysis but also analysis of analyses itself.   
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
These are just tools for 'I' so that it can simply continue in the garb of  
spiritual enquiry and enjoy its existence. It does not at akk matter if  
awareness is watching awareness or awareness is not watching awareness,  
whether Ramana's teachings are same as Michal James or different, whether  
Bhakti yoga is same as Jnana Yoga or different. Whether my point is accepted  
here or rejected. whether the discussions is helping or not.   
'I' \- just hold on to it, everything else is play and only play: Merry-  
Go-Round   
Self Enquiry is like the passive observer. A classic example which Shankara  
Bhagavatpadal has given is that of the bird Dove which lays eggs and carefully  
guards it everyday and accumulates food for it from various places and when  
the eggs are going to hatch, one day the crow comes pushes the eggs down from  
the nest and eats all the eggs and just born dove. The dove, which comes there  
just sees all this without reaction. It just remains.   
Such should be our enquiry.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Here is the classic pic taken from the famous movie Adi Shankaracharya. Its  
one of the best examples as to how our enquiry has to be carried on: Crow and dove.Crow is the doer, the active one.The dove is the passive  
observer, the atman(inner self) - our attention should be always focussed only  
on this.   
instead of focusing our attention on the 'I', if the Dove begins to fight with  
the crow, it is only going to cause damage and loss of peace. Just remaining  
indifferent to what is happening, remaining in the world, carrying out our  
duties, we should remain like the Dove with our attention focused on the Self  
till our Prarabhha karma is dissolved.

Dear Mr.Nagaraj,   
 I agree with your comments as above.When we know that who am I is simply holding on to the "I", why so many posts in this forum on various headings on various topics?. **Bhagavan has given his first teaching "Naan Yar' crystal clear without any room for doubt and still do we require endless discussions on his teachings ?** **It is enough if only Bhagavan 's teachings alone are published in this site as being done by Sri Subramanian and Mr.Prasanth (Both of them are doing great service) and there are sufficient material for them to publish more of Bhagaan's works for many years**.This will help members who have not so far gone thro his books and for the one who has already gone through, it will help to refresh.Few years back, Swami Chinmayananda was invited to a Ramana function and was asked to deliver his talk on Bhagavan Ramana.He did not deliver lecture and instead sat in silence forsome time and at the end told the audience that this is what bhagavan's teaching. **Bhagavan says that Silence is ever speaking and it is interrupted by speaking.Are we following his teachings?

Dear viswanathan   
I agree with your detailed clarfifcations on the points of Michael   
Langford 'Awareness Watching Awareness'. The problems in   
any translation of the original work are that one has to compromise   
with some loss of beauty and cadence. A friend of mine, long time   
back, went to study Russian, to read Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace   
in original. But most of us cannot do that way. Why? Even Tamizhians today  
cannot properly read and understand classical   
Tamizh works like Bhagavan's ULLadu Narpadu. The untranslatatbility of Tamizh  
is quite high. In Tamizh, one often goes even without a verb. Nan Yaar means  
only "I Who" and not   
"Who am I?" Hence many problems have to be confronted by the   
translators. So long as Langford clarifies Watching means Being,   
then, as I already wrote, there is no problem. Even in Sanskrit,   
sometimes the word Darshan means not seeing but being. Siva darshan sometimes  
means Being Siva or Being in Sivam.   
As regards methods, again since every marga leads one ultimately to the one  
marga of self attention, there is no quarrel, in that sense.   
I also refer to Michael James as you have mentioned. He is the guy who read  
and mastered Tamizh while simultaneously venturing understanding and  
practicing Bhagavan Ramana's methods. Hence his books and translations are  
really of a higher order. In his   
Happiness and the Art of Being, he refers to ULLadu Narpadu   
verses and he always gives in italics the Tamizh word or phrases and again and  
again use many ways to describe the purport.   
Arunachala Siva.

OK   
How many of you tried "Awareness Watching Awareness" and found it different  
from Remaining as Self or Self inquiry?   
I tried it, and i see that its just the same. I do not find any difference.  
Whether one says, remain as Awareness within or Be Still, how does it matter?   
Its just the same!

You are absolutely correct. The best course is to simply maintain silence. I  
have always found the tamizh works of Ramana more clearer than any of the  
other languages, it may be because it is my mother tongue, but I did not know  
how to read or write tamizh, but due to Bhagavan's grace, I am learning to  
read and write tamizh now atleast I am able to read it slowly though.   
Personally, I feel, Bhagavan's teachings are to be discussed within the Self  
alone, in the course of enquiry itself and not outside. One has to taste the  
tea himself to know its taste, no matter what elaboration anybody gives, is  
going to be of no avail.   
It is due to the Vasana of finding out answers to our questions that breeds  
questions and endless discussions. Bhagavans says, we need not know any  
answers at all. We fail to recognise the very presence of Bhagavan Ramana, if  
he is not there physically, does it mean that he is not going to clear our  
questions within? its because of this wrong notion, that we begin to discuss  
our issues or questions and it leads to analyses over analyses. What we need  
is a strong belief or Faith or Shraddha that Bhagavan will clear all doubts  
Himself and I need not ask anybody and that He himself will reveal it to me in  
any way, maybe an unknown person would come and say something in some other  
context, or through some incidents. We just need to remain alive and keep the  
enquiry always going. Like how Dhathathreya had 24 Gurus, most of them being  
animals, in a similar way, Bhagavan will bestow on us the clarity in some way  
or the other.   
To ask doubts and discussing it is going outwards. We have to remain within  
our self - holding on just to 'I' alone.   
In Talks: 253: Bhagavan has said The illiterates are certainly better off than the  
literates whose egos are not destroyed by the quest of the self.   
355: "Illiteracy is ignorance: education is learned ignorance. Both of them  
are ignorant of their true aim; whereas a sage is not ignorant because there  
is no aim for him."   
D.: Mind itself is very subtle and is also the same as the Atman.   
How shall we know the nature of the mind? You have said that all   
supports are useless. What should be our stand then?   
M.: Where does your mind stand?   
D.: Where does it stand?   
M.: Ask the mind itself.   
D.: I ask you now. Should we concentrate on mind then?   
M.: Um!   
D.: But what is the nature of the mind? It is formless. The problem   
is perplexing.   
M.: Why are you perplexed?   
D.: The sastras want us to concentrate and I cannot do so.   
M.: Through what sastras have we known our existence?   
D.: It is a matter of experience. But I want to concentrate.   
M.: Be free from thoughts. Do not hold on to anything. They do not   
hold you. Be yourself.   
D.: I do not yet understand as to where I take my stand and concentrate.   
Can I meditate on my mind?   
M.: Whose mind?   
D.: My own mind?   
M.: Who are you? The question now resolves itself all right.   
(All retired for lunch. The visitor returned at 2-30 p.m. and pursued   
the same question.)   
He said: Maharshi advises the seeker to get rid of thoughts. On what   
should I concentrate the mind after all the thoughts are expelled? I   
do not see where I stand then and on what I should concentrate.   
M.: For whom is the concentration?   
D.: For the mind.   
M.: Then concentrate the mind.   
D.: On what?   
M.: Answer the question yourself. What is the mind? Why should   
you concentrate?   
D.: I do not know what the mind is. I ask Maharshi.   
M.: Maharshi does not seek to know the mind. The questioner must   
question the mind itself as to what it is.   
 **D.: Maharshi advises that the mind should be divested of thoughts.   
M.: This is itself a thought.**   
D.: When all thoughts disappear what remains over?   
M.: Is the mind different from thoughts?   
 **D.: No. The mind is made up of thoughts. My point is this: When all   
thoughts are got rid of, how shall I concentrate the mind?   
M.: Is not this also a thought?**   
D.: Yes, but I am advised to concentrate.   
M.: Why should you concentrate? Why should you not allow your   
thoughts free play?   
D.: The sastras say that the thoughts, thus playing free, lead us astray,   
that is, to unreal and changeful things.   
M.: So then, you want not to be led to unreal and changeful things. Your   
thoughts are unreal and changeful. You want to hold the Reality. That   
is exactly what I say. The thoughts are unreal. Get rid of them.   
 **D.: I understand now. Yet there is a doubt. Not a trice can you remain   
inactive. How shall I be able to rid myself of thoughts?   
M.: The same Gita says: Although all actions take place, I am not the doer.   
It is like the sun towards the world activities. The Self always remains   
actionless, whereas thoughts arise and subside. The Self is Perfection; it   
is immutable; the mind is limited and changeful. You need only to cast   
off your limitations. Your perfection thus stands revealed.**   
D.: Grace is necessary for it.   
 _ **M.: Grace is ever present. All that is necessary is that you surrender to  
It.**_   
D.: I surrender and pray that even if I go wrong I may be forcibly   
drawn to it.   
 **M.: Is this surrender? Surrender to be complete must be   
unquestioning.**   
D.: Yes, I surrender. You say I must dive into the ocean of the Self   
like a pearl-diver into the sea.   
M.: Because you are now thinking that you are out of the ocean of   
Consciousness.   
D.: I practise pranayama. It generates heat in the body. What should   
I do?   
M.: The heat will pass away when the mind gains calm   
D.: That is true but most difficult.   
 **M.: This is again a thought which is an obstacle.

I agree with Udai agru.   
Even Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami also says the same thing.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Mano Nasam means only destruction of  
ignorance in the mind but not destruction of mind.   
If really problems solve by killing our mind then it can be solved by taking  
some injection like anaesthesia. :-)   
So solution is to know that we are not the mind and it is mithya i.e dependent  
on our real naturre i.e sat-chit-ananda.

The point is : mind cannot be killed, coz its never alive to be killed.   
like the snake on a rope. should the snake be killed?   
i am awareness, right now -- there is no choice here.   
and as awareness, i "CANNOT" get sad, happy or anything else. AS AWareness, i  
a Every STillness.   
so its not "Be Still" \-- u R STILLNESS. .. no choice here!   
so when someone says "I WILL BE STILL" thats foolish. As Awareness there is no  
choice. One is STILLNESS ITSELF.   
AS mind, one cannot remain still... coz mind by nature is unreal. mind cannot  
become SAT.   
So, here is the problem. People want the mind to be Still... body to stop  
growing!! how is it ever possible.   
body by its nature has to grow old. mind by its nature has to change. Self  
cannot Change.   
This is the essence.   
Swami Suddhananda gives a nice example: Someone was asked "What is ur age", he  
said "30". "But u said the same thing 10 years ago", asked another who was  
present there. "That is right, i tell the truth and truth cannot change", was  
his reply!   
what kind of truth is that??   
The attempt to stop the mirage like world from appearing is also a mistake.  
coz it shall continue as long as one's prarabdha is there unfinished. no one  
can stop it.   
Love!

The very entity which also says that mind cannot be killed is mind itself.   
In the snake and rope example, snake is an illusion - Mithya and the rope is  
Asat.

Awareness is completely pure. Why is there a need to affirm that I am  
awareness? and to whom is this made?

yes. its mind that is saying.   
and that knowledge "u r awareness" is required for mind only.   
coz, the Self never needs this knowledge. Body cannot have it.   
Its very simple.   
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too?   
is not the instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for  
mind.   
MITHYA and ASAT have one basic difference. Mithya is like a mirage. it appears  
to be present, though its purely ASAT.   
So one cannot stop the appearance. it continues.

and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too? is not the instruction "u r not this,  
but that which is outside", its for mind.   
Silence  
when the sage comes on the screen and says u are not this, you are not that  
and etc... and what ever you decide to do: 1 Stop the movie,   
2 continue the movie   
3 follow the sage   
4 not listen the sage   
5 do self enquiry   
6 letting the movie continue by allowing the assitant director to decide on  
the next scenarios believing that it cannot affect me, etc...   
these are still part of the movie itself. These are all the various courses  
the mind has, as options in the movie, as the director. These are "Freewill"  
which the i believes it has, which it can use to do what i wants to.   
Movie is in reality, not there at all, movie exist only for the mind alone  
which is non-self. In ignorance, the character itself, is the one which has  
created the movie and various scenarios and also the sage who comes and says  
you are not this you are that is just another character in the movie created  
by the mind again to make the movie more interesting, thats all.   
Once the character discards his dress knowing its limitedness - means there is  
no more i at all, no director at all, there is no more movie anymore. Movie  
existed only for the mithya i.   
The instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for mind." is  
itself just Mithya as well. It is just a story in the movie, which the i gets  
identified with whereby 'i' mistakenly takes these instruction for itself and  
begins to enquire who am i, I am the Self, I am this and I am that. these are  
all again just illusions. There is no need for self enquiry as well.   
There is no movie at all.   
Appearance is only for the 'i' mind alone. as long as the mind exists  
appearances will continue, as appearances are all the creations of the mind  
alone. Where there are no appearances and where only  
awareness/consciousness/Self alone IS, is real. _Where appearances still are_  
, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.

Dear Devotees,   
 I would like to share some of my views on various comments by forum members. Members comments are given in bold and my comments are in italics.   
1\. AWA is not Self enquiry since the moment the word watching is used, then  
the   
 subject object relation ship comes into picture and hence it cannot be the state of   
 BEING..Also how can awareness be watched?   
 _  
Comments: Mr. Michael Langford has mentioned that Awareness Watching  
Awareness is Awareness Being Awareness and he also says that because of long  
ancient habit of looking outwards towards people places and things, the word  
watching is used in practice instructions. Also he says that that way we take  
that same habit of watching people, places and things and we shut our eyes and  
turn it inwards. That is why the word watching is used. **Mr.Michael Langford  
says that what is real is awareness watching awareness, looking inward. What  
is unreal is looking outward towards the world of people places and things.  
Hence AWA is in line with Bjhagavans Self Enquiry   
**There are some comments in the forum that how can awareness be watched? If  
the word watching is inappropriate, then a doubt arises in mind how the  
word enquiry is appropriate in Self enquiry. When the word enquiry is used  
then doubt arises about who should enquire and whether self can be enquired  
and if self can be enquired then there must be enquirer similar to watcher in  
the word watching. All these doubts do not arise if tamil word SUMMA IRU is  
used to denote self enquiry**. Bhagavan ramana maharishi has instructed my  
mother around 80 years ago when she was a child that she should read  
Bhagavans works in the same language in which it was originally composed.I  
remember to have read some where that Bhagavan has given similar  
instructions to Annamalai Swami. Bhagavan has composed his great works such  
as   
 Nan Yar, Upadesa Undiar, Ulladhu Naarpathu,Arunachala Akshara mana malai etc  
in Tamil and when it is translated in other languages, it does not convey the  
same meaning as in tamil.. **In this context, I would like members to go  
through the commentary in English on Nan Yar by Mr.Michel James where in he  
uses the same original tamil words in many places in his commentary to  
ensure that the meaning is not distorted.**_   
[/b]   
2.As per AWA, it should be done on certain hours.   
 _Comments:Mr Michael Langford says that spend as many hours per day  
practicing as you can. **If you only practice awareness watching awareness for  
30 minutes per day and spend the other 23 and a half hours looking outward,  
you will not progress very quickly. If you want rapid results, then drop your  
unnecessary activities to free up time so you can practice for many hours per  
day, everyday. Maybe once per week on one of your days off from work you can  
devote the whole day to just practicing awareness watching awareness. Again  
this is in line with Bhagavans teachings that vichara should be done  
throughout the entire waking state   
**_ [/b]   
3.As per AWA, one should practice with eyes closed.   
 _Comments:To a question put to Bhagavan whether eyes should be open or not  
like this Bhagaan answers thus   
A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes it happens that when the eyes are  
closed the latent thoughts rush forth with great vigour. It may also be  
difficult to introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of  
mind to do so. The mind is contaminated when it takes in objects. Otherwise,  
it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind active in its own  
pursuit without taking in external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
 **From the very first sentence in Bhagavan s answer, it is evident that it  
may be done either way.**   
_   
4.As per AWA,ten methods are suggested and how can there be 10 methods since  
there is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being still.   
 _Comments: In Hinduism, four margas(paths) are prescribed for realization  
and devotees can follow any marga to reach the goal of Self realization. In  
Guru Ramana Mr.Cohen, quotes Bhagavan and says that the ultimate goal is  
realize the self and the paths are left to individuals. In fact, Bhagavan has  
told that Bakthi and Jnana are one and the same. In this context, I would like  
to quote an explanation given by late Paramacharya of Kanchi Mutt Sri  
Chandrasekara Saraswathi Swamigal. A devotee had a genuine doubt and asked  
Paramacharya why Paramacharya is confined to pujas and rituals and does not  
perform siddhis(miracles) like Sri. Sathya Sai Baba.. Paramacharya replied  
that the goal of his and Sri.Sathya Sa Baba are one and the same ie to bring  
everybody in to divinity and only difference is that they adopt different  
techniques like marketing people adopt different techniques to sell the goods.   
Bhagvan has given all the spiritual instructions very crystal clear and in  
simple language. In spite of that, during his life time, we can find devotees  
going on questioning about self enquiry again and again and this is evident  
if we go through the bookTalks wherein similar questions on self enquiry  
are repeated at number of places by different devotees. These devotees who put  
questions to hagavan are not ordinary layman but intellectuals and highly  
learned. **In order to cater to needs of people with different caliber,  
Micheal has given different methods and he is not suggested to follow all  
methods. It is left to individuals to follow the method which suits him  
best.This is in line with Bhagavan suggesting two methods ie doing sadhana  
with closed eyes and with open eyes. Which ever suits a devotee, he can follow  
it. Ultimately, the goal is to turn our attention inwards to the subject from  
objects.**   
 **All 10 methods suggested by Mr.Michael boils down to turning the  
attention inwards only and nothing else. Once a devotee becomes proficient in  
practice, he can practice sadhana eyes closed/open, one hour a day to 24  
hours a day,walking/sitting /laying/at rest room/ brushing his teeth. Only  
time he cannot do is while at sleep and when he is actively engaged in any  
work.When he is engaged in any serious activity, he automatically goes into  
meditation since his full attention is on that activity and there no  
thoughts**.   
**To conclude, I am fully convinced by Bhagavans teaching that at some  
point of time, we should forget what we have learned, stop reading books and  
turn our attention inwards. By mere reading various scriptures and endless  
discussion does not lead to realization unless we practice what we have  
learned.. To quote swami Sivananda of Rishikesh, an ounce of practice is  
better than tons of reading. In Sanskrit, it is known as Sravanam, mananam and  
Nithidyasanam and in Tirukkural, Tiruvallur says Karka Kashadara  
Karka.karrapin Nirka Thaga when means read and understand well and then  
practice what you have learnt. Do we[/b_**]?

It is the tendancy of our nature that we complicate things by not only our own  
analysis but also analysis of analyses itself.   
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
These are just tools for 'I' so that it can simply continue in the garb of  
spiritual enquiry and enjoy its existence. It does not at akk matter if  
awareness is watching awareness or awareness is not watching awareness,  
whether Ramana's teachings are same as Michal James or different, whether  
Bhakti yoga is same as Jnana Yoga or different. Whether my point is accepted  
here or rejected. whether the discussions is helping or not.   
'I' \- just hold on to it, everything else is play and only play: Merry-  
Go-Round   
Self Enquiry is like the passive observer. A classic example which Shankara  
Bhagavatpadal has given is that of the bird Dove which lays eggs and carefully  
guards it everyday and accumulates food for it from various places and when  
the eggs are going to hatch, one day the crow comes pushes the eggs down from  
the nest and eats all the eggs and just born dove. The dove, which comes there  
just sees all this without reaction. It just remains.   
Such should be our enquiry.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Here is the classic pic taken from the famous movie Adi Shankaracharya. Its  
one of the best examples as to how our enquiry has to be carried on: Crow and dove.Crow is the doer, the active one.The dove is the passive  
observer, the atman(inner self) - our attention should be always focussed only  
on this.   
instead of focusing our attention on the 'I', if the Dove begins to fight with  
the crow, it is only going to cause damage and loss of peace. Just remaining  
indifferent to what is happening, remaining in the world, carrying out our  
duties, we should remain like the Dove with our attention focused on the Self  
till our Prarabhha karma is dissolved.

Dear Mr.Nagaraj,   
 I agree with your comments as above.When we know that who am I is simply holding on to the "I", why so many posts in this forum on various headings on various topics?. **Bhagavan has given his first teaching "Naan Yar' crystal clear without any room for doubt and still do we require endless discussions on his teachings ?** **It is enough if only Bhagavan 's teachings alone are published in this site as being done by Sri Subramanian and Mr.Prasanth (Both of them are doing great service) and there are sufficient material for them to publish more of Bhagaan's works for many years**.This will help members who have not so far gone thro his books and for the one who has already gone through, it will help to refresh.Few years back, Swami Chinmayananda was invited to a Ramana function and was asked to deliver his talk on Bhagavan Ramana.He did not deliver lecture and instead sat in silence forsome time and at the end told the audience that this is what bhagavan's teaching. **Bhagavan says that Silence is ever speaking and it is interrupted by speaking.Are we following his teachings?

## Re:[34] Is 'Awareness Watching Awareness'-method same as Sri Bhagavan's Self- Attention?

Dear viswanathan   
I agree with your detailed clarfifcations on the points of Michael   
Langford 'Awareness Watching Awareness'. The problems in   
any translation of the original work are that one has to compromise   
with some loss of beauty and cadence. A friend of mine, long time   
back, went to study Russian, to read Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace   
in original. But most of us cannot do that way. Why? Even Tamizhians today  
cannot properly read and understand classical   
Tamizh works like Bhagavan's ULLadu Narpadu. The untranslatatbility of Tamizh  
is quite high. In Tamizh, one often goes even without a verb. Nan Yaar means  
only "I Who" and not   
"Who am I?" Hence many problems have to be confronted by the   
translators. So long as Langford clarifies Watching means Being,   
then, as I already wrote, there is no problem. Even in Sanskrit,   
sometimes the word Darshan means not seeing but being. Siva darshan sometimes  
means Being Siva or Being in Sivam.   
As regards methods, again since every marga leads one ultimately to the one  
marga of self attention, there is no quarrel, in that sense.   
I also refer to Michael James as you have mentioned. He is the guy who read  
and mastered Tamizh while simultaneously venturing understanding and  
practicing Bhagavan Ramana's methods. Hence his books and translations are  
really of a higher order. In his   
Happiness and the Art of Being, he refers to ULLadu Narpadu   
verses and he always gives in italics the Tamizh word or phrases and again and  
again use many ways to describe the purport.   
Arunachala Siva.

OK   
How many of you tried "Awareness Watching Awareness" and found it different  
from Remaining as Self or Self inquiry?   
I tried it, and i see that its just the same. I do not find any difference.  
Whether one says, remain as Awareness within or Be Still, how does it matter?   
Its just the same!

Dear I,   
Quote from: viswanathan on June 28, 2010, 03:16:39 AM  
 I agree with your comments as above.When we know that who am I is simply holding on to the "I", why so many posts in this forum on various headings on various topics?. **Bhagavan has given his first teaching "Naan Yar' crystal clear without any room for doubt and still do we require endless discussions on his teachings ?** **It is enough if only Bhagavan 's teachings alone are published in this site as being done by Sri Subramanian and Mr.Prasanth (Both of them are doing great service) and there are sufficient material for them to publish more of Bhagaan's works for many years**.This will help members who have not so far gone thro his books and for the one who has already gone through, it will help to refresh.Few years back, Swami Chinmayananda was invited to a Ramana function and was asked to deliver his talk on Bhagavan Ramana.He did not deliver lecture and instead sat in silence forsome time and at the end told the audience that this is what bhagavan's teaching. **Bhagavan says that Silence is ever speaking and it is interrupted by speaking.Are we following his teachings?**  
You are absolutely correct. The best course is to simply maintain silence. I  
have always found the tamizh works of Ramana more clearer than any of the  
other languages, it may be because it is my mother tongue, but I did not know  
how to read or write tamizh, but due to Bhagavan's grace, I am learning to  
read and write tamizh now atleast I am able to read it slowly though.   
Personally, I feel, Bhagavan's teachings are to be discussed within the Self  
alone, in the course of enquiry itself and not outside. One has to taste the  
tea himself to know its taste, no matter what elaboration anybody gives, is  
going to be of no avail.   
It is due to the Vasana of finding out answers to our questions that breeds  
questions and endless discussions. Bhagavans says, we need not know any  
answers at all. We fail to recognise the very presence of Bhagavan Ramana, if  
he is not there physically, does it mean that he is not going to clear our  
questions within? its because of this wrong notion, that we begin to discuss  
our issues or questions and it leads to analyses over analyses. What we need  
is a strong belief or Faith or Shraddha that Bhagavan will clear all doubts  
Himself and I need not ask anybody and that He himself will reveal it to me in  
any way, maybe an unknown person would come and say something in some other  
context, or through some incidents. We just need to remain alive and keep the  
enquiry always going. Like how Dhathathreya had 24 Gurus, most of them being  
animals, in a similar way, Bhagavan will bestow on us the clarity in some way  
or the other.   
To ask doubts and discussing it is going outwards. We have to remain within  
our self - holding on just to 'I' alone.   
In Talks: 253: Bhagavan has said The illiterates are certainly better off than the  
literates whose egos are not destroyed by the quest of the self.   
355: "Illiteracy is ignorance: education is learned ignorance. Both of them  
are ignorant of their true aim; whereas a sage is not ignorant because there  
is no aim for him."   
D.: Mind itself is very subtle and is also the same as the Atman.   
How shall we know the nature of the mind? You have said that all   
supports are useless. What should be our stand then?   
M.: Where does your mind stand?   
D.: Where does it stand?   
M.: Ask the mind itself.   
D.: I ask you now. Should we concentrate on mind then?   
M.: Um!   
D.: But what is the nature of the mind? It is formless. The problem   
is perplexing.   
M.: Why are you perplexed?   
D.: The sastras want us to concentrate and I cannot do so.   
M.: Through what sastras have we known our existence?   
D.: It is a matter of experience. But I want to concentrate.   
M.: Be free from thoughts. Do not hold on to anything. They do not   
hold you. Be yourself.   
D.: I do not yet understand as to where I take my stand and concentrate.   
Can I meditate on my mind?   
M.: Whose mind?   
D.: My own mind?   
M.: Who are you? The question now resolves itself all right.   
(All retired for lunch. The visitor returned at 2-30 p.m. and pursued   
the same question.)   
He said: Maharshi advises the seeker to get rid of thoughts. On what   
should I concentrate the mind after all the thoughts are expelled? I   
do not see where I stand then and on what I should concentrate.   
M.: For whom is the concentration?   
D.: For the mind.   
M.: Then concentrate the mind.   
D.: On what?   
M.: Answer the question yourself. What is the mind? Why should   
you concentrate?   
D.: I do not know what the mind is. I ask Maharshi.   
M.: Maharshi does not seek to know the mind. The questioner must   
question the mind itself as to what it is.   
 **D.: Maharshi advises that the mind should be divested of thoughts.   
M.: This is itself a thought.**   
D.: When all thoughts disappear what remains over?   
M.: Is the mind different from thoughts?   
 **D.: No. The mind is made up of thoughts. My point is this: When all   
thoughts are got rid of, how shall I concentrate the mind?   
M.: Is not this also a thought?**   
D.: Yes, but I am advised to concentrate.   
M.: Why should you concentrate? Why should you not allow your   
thoughts free play?   
D.: The sastras say that the thoughts, thus playing free, lead us astray,   
that is, to unreal and changeful things.   
M.: So then, you want not to be led to unreal and changeful things. Your   
thoughts are unreal and changeful. You want to hold the Reality. That   
is exactly what I say. The thoughts are unreal. Get rid of them.   
 **D.: I understand now. Yet there is a doubt. Not a trice can you remain   
inactive. How shall I be able to rid myself of thoughts?   
M.: The same Gita says: Although all actions take place, I am not the doer.   
It is like the sun towards the world activities. The Self always remains   
actionless, whereas thoughts arise and subside. The Self is Perfection; it   
is immutable; the mind is limited and changeful. You need only to cast   
off your limitations. Your perfection thus stands revealed.**   
D.: Grace is necessary for it.   
 _ **M.: Grace is ever present. All that is necessary is that you surrender to  
It.**_   
D.: I surrender and pray that even if I go wrong I may be forcibly   
drawn to it.   
 **M.: Is this surrender? Surrender to be complete must be   
unquestioning.**   
D.: Yes, I surrender. You say I must dive into the ocean of the Self   
like a pearl-diver into the sea.   
M.: Because you are now thinking that you are out of the ocean of   
Consciousness.   
D.: I practise pranayama. It generates heat in the body. What should   
I do?   
M.: The heat will pass away when the mind gains calm   
D.: That is true but most difficult.   
 **M.: This is again a thought which is an obstacle.

Thought is an obstacle if i am moving in the thought world.   
how can thought obstruct the Self?   
how can a building obstruct the space?   
I am not saying Sri Ramana is wrong.   
i am just saying, the person who recorded it might not have done it all that  
well!

I agree with Udai agru.   
Even Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami also says the same thing.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Mano Nasam means only destruction of  
ignorance in the mind but not destruction of mind.   
If really problems solve by killing our mind then it can be solved by taking  
some injection like anaesthesia. :-)   
So solution is to know that we are not the mind and it is mithya i.e dependent  
on our real naturre i.e sat-chit-ananda.

Dear I,   
I would rather put it this way: When the glass tumbler is half filled with water. One says its half filled and  
the other says its half empty.   
Thats all is the difference.

The point is : mind cannot be killed, coz its never alive to be killed.   
like the snake on a rope. should the snake be killed?   
i am awareness, right now -- there is no choice here.   
and as awareness, i "CANNOT" get sad, happy or anything else. AS AWareness, i  
a Every STillness.   
so its not "Be Still" \-- u R STILLNESS. .. no choice here!   
so when someone says "I WILL BE STILL" thats foolish. As Awareness there is no  
choice. One is STILLNESS ITSELF.   
AS mind, one cannot remain still... coz mind by nature is unreal. mind cannot  
become SAT.   
So, here is the problem. People want the mind to be Still... body to stop  
growing!! how is it ever possible.   
body by its nature has to grow old. mind by its nature has to change. Self  
cannot Change.   
This is the essence.   
Swami Suddhananda gives a nice example: Someone was asked "What is ur age", he  
said "30". "But u said the same thing 10 years ago", asked another who was  
present there. "That is right, i tell the truth and truth cannot change", was  
his reply!   
what kind of truth is that??   
The attempt to stop the mirage like world from appearing is also a mistake.  
coz it shall continue as long as one's prarabdha is there unfinished. no one  
can stop it.   
Love!   
Silence

The very entity which also says that mind cannot be killed is mind itself.   
In the snake and rope example, snake is an illusion - Mithya and the rope is  
Asat.

Awareness is completely pure. Why is there a need to affirm that I am  
awareness? and to whom is this made?

yes. its mind that is saying.   
and that knowledge "u r awareness" is required for mind only.   
coz, the Self never needs this knowledge. Body cannot have it.   
Its very simple.   
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too?   
is not the instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for  
mind.   
MITHYA and ASAT have one basic difference. Mithya is like a mirage. it appears  
to be present, though its purely ASAT.   
So one cannot stop the appearance. it continues.

Dear I,   
In total agreement with your points, I would like to bring in my views in the  
same example quoted by you: Quote from: srkudai on June 28, 2010, 12:47:37 PM  
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too? is not the instruction "u r not this,  
but that which is outside", its for mind.   
Silence  
when the sage comes on the screen and says u are not this, you are not that  
and etc... and what ever you decide to do: 1 Stop the movie,   
2 continue the movie   
3 follow the sage   
4 not listen the sage   
5 do self enquiry   
6 letting the movie continue by allowing the assitant director to decide on  
the next scenarios believing that it cannot affect me, etc...   
these are still part of the movie itself. These are all the various courses  
the mind has, as options in the movie, as the director. These are "Freewill"  
which the i believes it has, which it can use to do what i wants to.   
Movie is in reality, not there at all, movie exist only for the mind alone  
which is non-self. In ignorance, the character itself, is the one which has  
created the movie and various scenarios and also the sage who comes and says  
you are not this you are that is just another character in the movie created  
by the mind again to make the movie more interesting, thats all.   
Once the character discards his dress knowing its limitedness - means there is  
no more i at all, no director at all, there is no more movie anymore. Movie  
existed only for the mithya i.   
The instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for mind." is  
itself just Mithya as well. It is just a story in the movie, which the i gets  
identified with whereby 'i' mistakenly takes these instruction for itself and  
begins to enquire who am i, I am the Self, I am this and I am that. these are  
all again just illusions. There is no need for self enquiry as well.   
There is no movie at all.   
Appearance is only for the 'i' mind alone. as long as the mind exists  
appearances will continue, as appearances are all the creations of the mind  
alone. Where there are no appearances and where only  
awareness/consciousness/Self alone IS, is real. _Where appearances still are_  
, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.

## Re:[30] Is 'Awareness Watching Awareness'-method same as Sri Bhagavan's Self- Attention?

Dear Devotees,   
 I would like to share some of my views on various comments by forum members. Members comments are given in bold and my comments are in italics.   
1\. AWA is not Self enquiry since the moment the word watching is used, then  
the   
 subject object relation ship comes into picture and hence it cannot be the state of   
 BEING..Also how can awareness be watched?   
 _  
Comments: Mr. Michael Langford has mentioned that Awareness Watching  
Awareness is Awareness Being Awareness and he also says that because of long  
ancient habit of looking outwards towards people places and things, the word  
watching is used in practice instructions. Also he says that that way we take  
that same habit of watching people, places and things and we shut our eyes and  
turn it inwards. That is why the word watching is used. **Mr.Michael Langford  
says that what is real is awareness watching awareness, looking inward. What  
is unreal is looking outward towards the world of people places and things.  
Hence AWA is in line with Bjhagavans Self Enquiry   
**There are some comments in the forum that how can awareness be watched? If  
the word watching is inappropriate, then a doubt arises in mind how the  
word enquiry is appropriate in Self enquiry. When the word enquiry is used  
then doubt arises about who should enquire and whether self can be enquired  
and if self can be enquired then there must be enquirer similar to watcher in  
the word watching. All these doubts do not arise if tamil word SUMMA IRU is  
used to denote self enquiry**. Bhagavan ramana maharishi has instructed my  
mother around 80 years ago when she was a child that she should read  
Bhagavans works in the same language in which it was originally composed.I  
remember to have read some where that Bhagavan has given similar  
instructions to Annamalai Swami. Bhagavan has composed his great works such  
as   
 Nan Yar, Upadesa Undiar, Ulladhu Naarpathu,Arunachala Akshara mana malai etc  
in Tamil and when it is translated in other languages, it does not convey the  
same meaning as in tamil.. **In this context, I would like members to go  
through the commentary in English on Nan Yar by Mr.Michel James where in he  
uses the same original tamil words in many places in his commentary to  
ensure that the meaning is not distorted.**_   
[/b]   
2.As per AWA, it should be done on certain hours.   
 _Comments:Mr Michael Langford says that spend as many hours per day  
practicing as you can. **If you only practice awareness watching awareness for  
30 minutes per day and spend the other 23 and a half hours looking outward,  
you will not progress very quickly. If you want rapid results, then drop your  
unnecessary activities to free up time so you can practice for many hours per  
day, everyday. Maybe once per week on one of your days off from work you can  
devote the whole day to just practicing awareness watching awareness. Again  
this is in line with Bhagavans teachings that vichara should be done  
throughout the entire waking state   
**_ [/b]   
3.As per AWA, one should practice with eyes closed.   
 _Comments:To a question put to Bhagavan whether eyes should be open or not  
like this Bhagaan answers thus   
A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes it happens that when the eyes are  
closed the latent thoughts rush forth with great vigour. It may also be  
difficult to introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of  
mind to do so. The mind is contaminated when it takes in objects. Otherwise,  
it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind active in its own  
pursuit without taking in external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
 **From the very first sentence in Bhagavan s answer, it is evident that it  
may be done either way.**   
_   
4.As per AWA,ten methods are suggested and how can there be 10 methods since  
there is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being still.   
 _Comments: In Hinduism, four margas(paths) are prescribed for realization  
and devotees can follow any marga to reach the goal of Self realization. In  
Guru Ramana Mr.Cohen, quotes Bhagavan and says that the ultimate goal is  
realize the self and the paths are left to individuals. In fact, Bhagavan has  
told that Bakthi and Jnana are one and the same. In this context, I would like  
to quote an explanation given by late Paramacharya of Kanchi Mutt Sri  
Chandrasekara Saraswathi Swamigal. A devotee had a genuine doubt and asked  
Paramacharya why Paramacharya is confined to pujas and rituals and does not  
perform siddhis(miracles) like Sri. Sathya Sai Baba.. Paramacharya replied  
that the goal of his and Sri.Sathya Sa Baba are one and the same ie to bring  
everybody in to divinity and only difference is that they adopt different  
techniques like marketing people adopt different techniques to sell the goods.   
Bhagvan has given all the spiritual instructions very crystal clear and in  
simple language. In spite of that, during his life time, we can find devotees  
going on questioning about self enquiry again and again and this is evident  
if we go through the bookTalks wherein similar questions on self enquiry  
are repeated at number of places by different devotees. These devotees who put  
questions to hagavan are not ordinary layman but intellectuals and highly  
learned. **In order to cater to needs of people with different caliber,  
Micheal has given different methods and he is not suggested to follow all  
methods. It is left to individuals to follow the method which suits him  
best.This is in line with Bhagavan suggesting two methods ie doing sadhana  
with closed eyes and with open eyes. Which ever suits a devotee, he can follow  
it. Ultimately, the goal is to turn our attention inwards to the subject from  
objects.**   
 **All 10 methods suggested by Mr.Michael boils down to turning the  
attention inwards only and nothing else. Once a devotee becomes proficient in  
practice, he can practice sadhana eyes closed/open, one hour a day to 24  
hours a day,walking/sitting /laying/at rest room/ brushing his teeth. Only  
time he cannot do is while at sleep and when he is actively engaged in any  
work.When he is engaged in any serious activity, he automatically goes into  
meditation since his full attention is on that activity and there no  
thoughts**.   
**To conclude, I am fully convinced by Bhagavans teaching that at some  
point of time, we should forget what we have learned, stop reading books and  
turn our attention inwards. By mere reading various scriptures and endless  
discussion does not lead to realization unless we practice what we have  
learned.. To quote swami Sivananda of Rishikesh, an ounce of practice is  
better than tons of reading. In Sanskrit, it is known as Sravanam, mananam and  
Nithidyasanam and in Tirukkural, Tiruvallur says Karka Kashadara  
Karka.karrapin Nirka Thaga when means read and understand well and then  
practice what you have learnt. Do we[/b_**]?

It is the tendancy of our nature that we complicate things by not only our own  
analysis but also analysis of analyses itself.   
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
These are just tools for 'I' so that it can simply continue in the garb of  
spiritual enquiry and enjoy its existence. It does not at akk matter if  
awareness is watching awareness or awareness is not watching awareness,  
whether Ramana's teachings are same as Michal James or different, whether  
Bhakti yoga is same as Jnana Yoga or different. Whether my point is accepted  
here or rejected. whether the discussions is helping or not.   
'I' \- just hold on to it, everything else is play and only play: Merry-  
Go-Round   
Self Enquiry is like the passive observer. A classic example which Shankara  
Bhagavatpadal has given is that of the bird Dove which lays eggs and carefully  
guards it everyday and accumulates food for it from various places and when  
the eggs are going to hatch, one day the crow comes pushes the eggs down from  
the nest and eats all the eggs and just born dove. The dove, which comes there  
just sees all this without reaction. It just remains.   
Such should be our enquiry.

Here is the classic pic taken from the famous movie Adi Shankaracharya. Its  
one of the best examples as to how our enquiry has to be carried on: Crow and dove.Crow is the doer, the active one.The dove is the passive  
observer, the atman(inner self) - our attention should be always focussed only  
on this.   
instead of focusing our attention on the 'I', if the Dove begins to fight with  
the crow, it is only going to cause damage and loss of peace. Just remaining  
indifferent to what is happening, remaining in the world, carrying out our  
duties, we should remain like the Dove with our attention focused on the Self  
till our Prarabhha karma is dissolved.

Dear Mr.Nagaraj,   
 I agree with your comments as above.When we know that who am I is simply holding on to the "I", why so many posts in this forum on various headings on various topics?. **Bhagavan has given his first teaching "Naan Yar' crystal clear without any room for doubt and still do we require endless discussions on his teachings ?** **It is enough if only Bhagavan 's teachings alone are published in this site as being done by Sri Subramanian and Mr.Prasanth (Both of them are doing great service) and there are sufficient material for them to publish more of Bhagaan's works for many years**.This will help members who have not so far gone thro his books and for the one who has already gone through, it will help to refresh.Few years back, Swami Chinmayananda was invited to a Ramana function and was asked to deliver his talk on Bhagavan Ramana.He did not deliver lecture and instead sat in silence forsome time and at the end told the audience that this is what bhagavan's teaching. **Bhagavan says that Silence is ever speaking and it is interrupted by speaking.Are we following his teachings?

Dear viswanathan   
I agree with your detailed clarfifcations on the points of Michael   
Langford 'Awareness Watching Awareness'. The problems in   
any translation of the original work are that one has to compromise   
with some loss of beauty and cadence. A friend of mine, long time   
back, went to study Russian, to read Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace   
in original. But most of us cannot do that way. Why? Even Tamizhians today  
cannot properly read and understand classical   
Tamizh works like Bhagavan's ULLadu Narpadu. The untranslatatbility of Tamizh  
is quite high. In Tamizh, one often goes even without a verb. Nan Yaar means  
only "I Who" and not   
"Who am I?" Hence many problems have to be confronted by the   
translators. So long as Langford clarifies Watching means Being,   
then, as I already wrote, there is no problem. Even in Sanskrit,   
sometimes the word Darshan means not seeing but being. Siva darshan sometimes  
means Being Siva or Being in Sivam.   
As regards methods, again since every marga leads one ultimately to the one  
marga of self attention, there is no quarrel, in that sense.   
I also refer to Michael James as you have mentioned. He is the guy who read  
and mastered Tamizh while simultaneously venturing understanding and  
practicing Bhagavan Ramana's methods. Hence his books and translations are  
really of a higher order. In his   
Happiness and the Art of Being, he refers to ULLadu Narpadu   
verses and he always gives in italics the Tamizh word or phrases and again and  
again use many ways to describe the purport.

OK   
How many of you tried "Awareness Watching Awareness" and found it different  
from Remaining as Self or Self inquiry?   
I tried it, and i see that its just the same. I do not find any difference.  
Whether one says, remain as Awareness within or Be Still, how does it matter?   
Its just the same!

Dear I,   
Quote from: viswanathan on June 28, 2010, 03:16:39 AM  
 I agree with your comments as above.When we know that who am I is simply holding on to the "I", why so many posts in this forum on various headings on various topics?. **Bhagavan has given his first teaching "Naan Yar' crystal clear without any room for doubt and still do we require endless discussions on his teachings ?** **It is enough if only Bhagavan 's teachings alone are published in this site as being done by Sri Subramanian and Mr.Prasanth (Both of them are doing great service) and there are sufficient material for them to publish more of Bhagaan's works for many years**.This will help members who have not so far gone thro his books and for the one who has already gone through, it will help to refresh.Few years back, Swami Chinmayananda was invited to a Ramana function and was asked to deliver his talk on Bhagavan Ramana.He did not deliver lecture and instead sat in silence forsome time and at the end told the audience that this is what bhagavan's teaching. **Bhagavan says that Silence is ever speaking and it is interrupted by speaking.Are we following his teachings?**  
You are absolutely correct. The best course is to simply maintain silence. I  
have always found the tamizh works of Ramana more clearer than any of the  
other languages, it may be because it is my mother tongue, but I did not know  
how to read or write tamizh, but due to Bhagavan's grace, I am learning to  
read and write tamizh now atleast I am able to read it slowly though.   
Personally, I feel, Bhagavan's teachings are to be discussed within the Self  
alone, in the course of enquiry itself and not outside. One has to taste the  
tea himself to know its taste, no matter what elaboration anybody gives, is  
going to be of no avail.   
It is due to the Vasana of finding out answers to our questions that breeds  
questions and endless discussions. Bhagavans says, we need not know any  
answers at all. We fail to recognise the very presence of Bhagavan Ramana, if  
he is not there physically, does it mean that he is not going to clear our  
questions within? its because of this wrong notion, that we begin to discuss  
our issues or questions and it leads to analyses over analyses. What we need  
is a strong belief or Faith or Shraddha that Bhagavan will clear all doubts  
Himself and I need not ask anybody and that He himself will reveal it to me in  
any way, maybe an unknown person would come and say something in some other  
context, or through some incidents. We just need to remain alive and keep the  
enquiry always going. Like how Dhathathreya had 24 Gurus, most of them being  
animals, in a similar way, Bhagavan will bestow on us the clarity in some way  
or the other.   
To ask doubts and discussing it is going outwards. We have to remain within  
our self - holding on just to 'I' alone.   
In Talks: 253: Bhagavan has said The illiterates are certainly better off than the  
literates whose egos are not destroyed by the quest of the self.   
355: "Illiteracy is ignorance: education is learned ignorance. Both of them  
are ignorant of their true aim; whereas a sage is not ignorant because there  
is no aim for him."   
D.: Mind itself is very subtle and is also the same as the Atman.   
How shall we know the nature of the mind? You have said that all   
supports are useless. What should be our stand then?   
M.: Where does your mind stand?   
D.: Where does it stand?   
M.: Ask the mind itself.   
D.: I ask you now. Should we concentrate on mind then?   
M.: Um!   
D.: But what is the nature of the mind? It is formless. The problem   
is perplexing.   
M.: Why are you perplexed?   
D.: The sastras want us to concentrate and I cannot do so.   
M.: Through what sastras have we known our existence?   
D.: It is a matter of experience. But I want to concentrate.   
M.: Be free from thoughts. Do not hold on to anything. They do not   
hold you. Be yourself.   
D.: I do not yet understand as to where I take my stand and concentrate.   
Can I meditate on my mind?   
M.: Whose mind?   
D.: My own mind?   
M.: Who are you? The question now resolves itself all right.   
(All retired for lunch. The visitor returned at 2-30 p.m. and pursued   
the same question.)   
He said: Maharshi advises the seeker to get rid of thoughts. On what   
should I concentrate the mind after all the thoughts are expelled? I   
do not see where I stand then and on what I should concentrate.   
M.: For whom is the concentration?   
D.: For the mind.   
M.: Then concentrate the mind.   
D.: On what?   
M.: Answer the question yourself. What is the mind? Why should   
you concentrate?   
D.: I do not know what the mind is. I ask Maharshi.   
M.: Maharshi does not seek to know the mind. The questioner must   
question the mind itself as to what it is.   
 **D.: Maharshi advises that the mind should be divested of thoughts.   
M.: This is itself a thought.**   
D.: When all thoughts disappear what remains over?   
M.: Is the mind different from thoughts?   
 **D.: No. The mind is made up of thoughts. My point is this: When all   
thoughts are got rid of, how shall I concentrate the mind?   
M.: Is not this also a thought?**   
D.: Yes, but I am advised to concentrate.   
M.: Why should you concentrate? Why should you not allow your   
thoughts free play?   
D.: The sastras say that the thoughts, thus playing free, lead us astray,   
that is, to unreal and changeful things.   
M.: So then, you want not to be led to unreal and changeful things. Your   
thoughts are unreal and changeful. You want to hold the Reality. That   
is exactly what I say. The thoughts are unreal. Get rid of them.   
 **D.: I understand now. Yet there is a doubt. Not a trice can you remain   
inactive. How shall I be able to rid myself of thoughts?   
M.: The same Gita says: Although all actions take place, I am not the doer.   
It is like the sun towards the world activities. The Self always remains   
actionless, whereas thoughts arise and subside. The Self is Perfection; it   
is immutable; the mind is limited and changeful. You need only to cast   
off your limitations. Your perfection thus stands revealed.**   
D.: Grace is necessary for it.   
 _ **M.: Grace is ever present. All that is necessary is that you surrender to  
It.**_   
D.: I surrender and pray that even if I go wrong I may be forcibly   
drawn to it.   
 **M.: Is this surrender? Surrender to be complete must be   
unquestioning.**   
D.: Yes, I surrender. You say I must dive into the ocean of the Self   
like a pearl-diver into the sea.   
M.: Because you are now thinking that you are out of the ocean of   
Consciousness.   
D.: I practise pranayama. It generates heat in the body. What should   
I do?   
M.: The heat will pass away when the mind gains calm   
D.: That is true but most difficult.   
 **M.: This is again a thought which is an obstacle.

Thought is an obstacle if i am moving in the thought world.   
how can thought obstruct the Self?   
how can a building obstruct the space?   
I am not saying Sri Ramana is wrong.

I agree with Udai agru.   
Even Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami also says the same thing.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Mano Nasam means only destruction of  
ignorance in the mind but not destruction of mind.   
If really problems solve by killing our mind then it can be solved by taking  
some injection like anaesthesia. :-)   
So solution is to know that we are not the mind and it is mithya i.e dependent  
on our real naturre i.e sat-chit-ananda.

The point is : mind cannot be killed, coz its never alive to be killed.   
like the snake on a rope. should the snake be killed?   
i am awareness, right now -- there is no choice here.   
and as awareness, i "CANNOT" get sad, happy or anything else. AS AWareness, i  
a Every STillness.   
so its not "Be Still" \-- u R STILLNESS. .. no choice here!   
so when someone says "I WILL BE STILL" thats foolish. As Awareness there is no  
choice. One is STILLNESS ITSELF.   
AS mind, one cannot remain still... coz mind by nature is unreal. mind cannot  
become SAT.   
So, here is the problem. People want the mind to be Still... body to stop  
growing!! how is it ever possible.   
body by its nature has to grow old. mind by its nature has to change. Self  
cannot Change.   
This is the essence.   
Swami Suddhananda gives a nice example: Someone was asked "What is ur age", he  
said "30". "But u said the same thing 10 years ago", asked another who was  
present there. "That is right, i tell the truth and truth cannot change", was  
his reply!   
what kind of truth is that??   
The attempt to stop the mirage like world from appearing is also a mistake.  
coz it shall continue as long as one's prarabdha is there unfinished. no one  
can stop it.   
Love!   
Silence

The very entity which also says that mind cannot be killed is mind itself.   
In the snake and rope example, snake is an illusion - Mithya and the rope is  
Asat.

Awareness is completely pure. Why is there a need to affirm that I am  
awareness? and to whom is this made?

yes. its mind that is saying.   
and that knowledge "u r awareness" is required for mind only.   
coz, the Self never needs this knowledge. Body cannot have it.   
Its very simple.   
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too?   
is not the instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for  
mind.   
MITHYA and ASAT have one basic difference. Mithya is like a mirage. it appears  
to be present, though its purely ASAT.   
So one cannot stop the appearance. it continues.

Dear I,   
In total agreement with your points, I would like to bring in my views in the  
same example quoted by you: Quote from: srkudai on June 28, 2010, 12:47:37 PM  
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too? is not the instruction "u r not this,  
but that which is outside", its for mind.   
Silence  
when the sage comes on the screen and says u are not this, you are not that  
and etc... and what ever you decide to do: 1 Stop the movie,   
2 continue the movie   
3 follow the sage   
4 not listen the sage   
5 do self enquiry   
6 letting the movie continue by allowing the assitant director to decide on  
the next scenarios believing that it cannot affect me, etc...   
these are still part of the movie itself. These are all the various courses  
the mind has, as options in the movie, as the director. These are "Freewill"  
which the i believes it has, which it can use to do what i wants to.   
Movie is in reality, not there at all, movie exist only for the mind alone  
which is non-self. In ignorance, the character itself, is the one which has  
created the movie and various scenarios and also the sage who comes and says  
you are not this you are that is just another character in the movie created  
by the mind again to make the movie more interesting, thats all.   
Once the character discards his dress knowing its limitedness - means there is  
no more i at all, no director at all, there is no more movie anymore. Movie  
existed only for the mithya i.   
The instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for mind." is  
itself just Mithya as well. It is just a story in the movie, which the i gets  
identified with whereby 'i' mistakenly takes these instruction for itself and  
begins to enquire who am i, I am the Self, I am this and I am that. these are  
all again just illusions. There is no need for self enquiry as well.   
There is no movie at all.   
Appearance is only for the 'i' mind alone. as long as the mind exists  
appearances will continue, as appearances are all the creations of the mind  
alone. Where there are no appearances and where only  
awareness/consciousness/Self alone IS, is real. _Where appearances still are_  
, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.

Dear Devotees,   
 I would like to share some of my views on various comments by forum members. Members comments are given in bold and my comments are in italics.   
1\. AWA is not Self enquiry since the moment the word watching is used, then  
the   
 subject object relation ship comes into picture and hence it cannot be the state of   
 BEING..Also how can awareness be watched?   
 _  
Comments: Mr. Michael Langford has mentioned that Awareness Watching  
Awareness is Awareness Being Awareness and he also says that because of long  
ancient habit of looking outwards towards people places and things, the word  
watching is used in practice instructions. Also he says that that way we take  
that same habit of watching people, places and things and we shut our eyes and  
turn it inwards. That is why the word watching is used. **Mr.Michael Langford  
says that what is real is awareness watching awareness, looking inward. What  
is unreal is looking outward towards the world of people places and things.  
Hence AWA is in line with Bjhagavans Self Enquiry   
**There are some comments in the forum that how can awareness be watched? If  
the word watching is inappropriate, then a doubt arises in mind how the  
word enquiry is appropriate in Self enquiry. When the word enquiry is used  
then doubt arises about who should enquire and whether self can be enquired  
and if self can be enquired then there must be enquirer similar to watcher in  
the word watching. All these doubts do not arise if tamil word SUMMA IRU is  
used to denote self enquiry**. Bhagavan ramana maharishi has instructed my  
mother around 80 years ago when she was a child that she should read  
Bhagavans works in the same language in which it was originally composed.I  
remember to have read some where that Bhagavan has given similar  
instructions to Annamalai Swami. Bhagavan has composed his great works such  
as   
 Nan Yar, Upadesa Undiar, Ulladhu Naarpathu,Arunachala Akshara mana malai etc  
in Tamil and when it is translated in other languages, it does not convey the  
same meaning as in tamil.. **In this context, I would like members to go  
through the commentary in English on Nan Yar by Mr.Michel James where in he  
uses the same original tamil words in many places in his commentary to  
ensure that the meaning is not distorted.**_   
[/b]   
2.As per AWA, it should be done on certain hours.   
 _Comments:Mr Michael Langford says that spend as many hours per day  
practicing as you can. **If you only practice awareness watching awareness for  
30 minutes per day and spend the other 23 and a half hours looking outward,  
you will not progress very quickly. If you want rapid results, then drop your  
unnecessary activities to free up time so you can practice for many hours per  
day, everyday. Maybe once per week on one of your days off from work you can  
devote the whole day to just practicing awareness watching awareness. Again  
this is in line with Bhagavans teachings that vichara should be done  
throughout the entire waking state   
**_ [/b]   
3.As per AWA, one should practice with eyes closed.   
 _Comments:To a question put to Bhagavan whether eyes should be open or not  
like this Bhagaan answers thus   
A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes it happens that when the eyes are  
closed the latent thoughts rush forth with great vigour. It may also be  
difficult to introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of  
mind to do so. The mind is contaminated when it takes in objects. Otherwise,  
it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind active in its own  
pursuit without taking in external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
 **From the very first sentence in Bhagavan s answer, it is evident that it  
may be done either way.**   
_   
4.As per AWA,ten methods are suggested and how can there be 10 methods since  
there is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being still.   
 _Comments: In Hinduism, four margas(paths) are prescribed for realization  
and devotees can follow any marga to reach the goal of Self realization. In  
Guru Ramana Mr.Cohen, quotes Bhagavan and says that the ultimate goal is  
realize the self and the paths are left to individuals. In fact, Bhagavan has  
told that Bakthi and Jnana are one and the same. In this context, I would like  
to quote an explanation given by late Paramacharya of Kanchi Mutt Sri  
Chandrasekara Saraswathi Swamigal. A devotee had a genuine doubt and asked  
Paramacharya why Paramacharya is confined to pujas and rituals and does not  
perform siddhis(miracles) like Sri. Sathya Sai Baba.. Paramacharya replied  
that the goal of his and Sri.Sathya Sa Baba are one and the same ie to bring  
everybody in to divinity and only difference is that they adopt different  
techniques like marketing people adopt different techniques to sell the goods.   
Bhagvan has given all the spiritual instructions very crystal clear and in  
simple language. In spite of that, during his life time, we can find devotees  
going on questioning about self enquiry again and again and this is evident  
if we go through the bookTalks wherein similar questions on self enquiry  
are repeated at number of places by different devotees. These devotees who put  
questions to hagavan are not ordinary layman but intellectuals and highly  
learned. **In order to cater to needs of people with different caliber,  
Micheal has given different methods and he is not suggested to follow all  
methods. It is left to individuals to follow the method which suits him  
best.This is in line with Bhagavan suggesting two methods ie doing sadhana  
with closed eyes and with open eyes. Which ever suits a devotee, he can follow  
it. Ultimately, the goal is to turn our attention inwards to the subject from  
objects.**   
 **All 10 methods suggested by Mr.Michael boils down to turning the  
attention inwards only and nothing else. Once a devotee becomes proficient in  
practice, he can practice sadhana eyes closed/open, one hour a day to 24  
hours a day,walking/sitting /laying/at rest room/ brushing his teeth. Only  
time he cannot do is while at sleep and when he is actively engaged in any  
work.When he is engaged in any serious activity, he automatically goes into  
meditation since his full attention is on that activity and there no  
thoughts**.   
**To conclude, I am fully convinced by Bhagavans teaching that at some  
point of time, we should forget what we have learned, stop reading books and  
turn our attention inwards. By mere reading various scriptures and endless  
discussion does not lead to realization unless we practice what we have  
learned.. To quote swami Sivananda of Rishikesh, an ounce of practice is  
better than tons of reading. In Sanskrit, it is known as Sravanam, mananam and  
Nithidyasanam and in Tirukkural, Tiruvallur says Karka Kashadara  
Karka.karrapin Nirka Thaga when means read and understand well and then  
practice what you have learnt. Do we[/b_**]?

It is the tendancy of our nature that we complicate things by not only our own  
analysis but also analysis of analyses itself.   
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
These are just tools for 'I' so that it can simply continue in the garb of  
spiritual enquiry and enjoy its existence. It does not at akk matter if  
awareness is watching awareness or awareness is not watching awareness,  
whether Ramana's teachings are same as Michal James or different, whether  
Bhakti yoga is same as Jnana Yoga or different. Whether my point is accepted  
here or rejected. whether the discussions is helping or not.   
'I' \- just hold on to it, everything else is play and only play: Merry-  
Go-Round   
Self Enquiry is like the passive observer. A classic example which Shankara  
Bhagavatpadal has given is that of the bird Dove which lays eggs and carefully  
guards it everyday and accumulates food for it from various places and when  
the eggs are going to hatch, one day the crow comes pushes the eggs down from  
the nest and eats all the eggs and just born dove. The dove, which comes there  
just sees all this without reaction. It just remains.   
Such should be our enquiry.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Here is the classic pic taken from the famous movie Adi Shankaracharya. Its  
one of the best examples as to how our enquiry has to be carried on: Crow and dove.Crow is the doer, the active one.The dove is the passive  
observer, the atman(inner self) - our attention should be always focussed only  
on this.   
instead of focusing our attention on the 'I', if the Dove begins to fight with  
the crow, it is only going to cause damage and loss of peace. Just remaining  
indifferent to what is happening, remaining in the world, carrying out our  
duties, we should remain like the Dove with our attention focused on the Self  
till our Prarabhha karma is dissolved.

Dear Mr.Nagaraj,   
 I agree with your comments as above.When we know that who am I is simply holding on to the "I", why so many posts in this forum on various headings on various topics?. **Bhagavan has given his first teaching "Naan Yar' crystal clear without any room for doubt and still do we require endless discussions on his teachings ?** **It is enough if only Bhagavan 's teachings alone are published in this site as being done by Sri Subramanian and Mr.Prasanth (Both of them are doing great service) and there are sufficient material for them to publish more of Bhagaan's works for many years**.This will help members who have not so far gone thro his books and for the one who has already gone through, it will help to refresh.Few years back, Swami Chinmayananda was invited to a Ramana function and was asked to deliver his talk on Bhagavan Ramana.He did not deliver lecture and instead sat in silence forsome time and at the end told the audience that this is what bhagavan's teaching. **Bhagavan says that Silence is ever speaking and it is interrupted by speaking.Are we following his teachings?

Dear viswanathan   
I agree with your detailed clarfifcations on the points of Michael   
Langford 'Awareness Watching Awareness'. The problems in   
any translation of the original work are that one has to compromise   
with some loss of beauty and cadence. A friend of mine, long time   
back, went to study Russian, to read Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace   
in original. But most of us cannot do that way. Why? Even Tamizhians today  
cannot properly read and understand classical   
Tamizh works like Bhagavan's ULLadu Narpadu. The untranslatatbility of Tamizh  
is quite high. In Tamizh, one often goes even without a verb. Nan Yaar means  
only "I Who" and not   
"Who am I?" Hence many problems have to be confronted by the   
translators. So long as Langford clarifies Watching means Being,   
then, as I already wrote, there is no problem. Even in Sanskrit,   
sometimes the word Darshan means not seeing but being. Siva darshan sometimes  
means Being Siva or Being in Sivam.   
As regards methods, again since every marga leads one ultimately to the one  
marga of self attention, there is no quarrel, in that sense.   
I also refer to Michael James as you have mentioned. He is the guy who read  
and mastered Tamizh while simultaneously venturing understanding and  
practicing Bhagavan Ramana's methods. Hence his books and translations are  
really of a higher order. In his   
Happiness and the Art of Being, he refers to ULLadu Narpadu   
verses and he always gives in italics the Tamizh word or phrases and again and  
again use many ways to describe the purport.   
Arunachala Siva.

OK   
How many of you tried "Awareness Watching Awareness" and found it different  
from Remaining as Self or Self inquiry?   
I tried it, and i see that its just the same. I do not find any difference.  
Whether one says, remain as Awareness within or Be Still, how does it matter?   
Its just the same!

You are absolutely correct. The best course is to simply maintain silence. I  
have always found the tamizh works of Ramana more clearer than any of the  
other languages, it may be because it is my mother tongue, but I did not know  
how to read or write tamizh, but due to Bhagavan's grace, I am learning to  
read and write tamizh now atleast I am able to read it slowly though.   
Personally, I feel, Bhagavan's teachings are to be discussed within the Self  
alone, in the course of enquiry itself and not outside. One has to taste the  
tea himself to know its taste, no matter what elaboration anybody gives, is  
going to be of no avail.   
It is due to the Vasana of finding out answers to our questions that breeds  
questions and endless discussions. Bhagavans says, we need not know any  
answers at all. We fail to recognise the very presence of Bhagavan Ramana, if  
he is not there physically, does it mean that he is not going to clear our  
questions within? its because of this wrong notion, that we begin to discuss  
our issues or questions and it leads to analyses over analyses. What we need  
is a strong belief or Faith or Shraddha that Bhagavan will clear all doubts  
Himself and I need not ask anybody and that He himself will reveal it to me in  
any way, maybe an unknown person would come and say something in some other  
context, or through some incidents. We just need to remain alive and keep the  
enquiry always going. Like how Dhathathreya had 24 Gurus, most of them being  
animals, in a similar way, Bhagavan will bestow on us the clarity in some way  
or the other.   
To ask doubts and discussing it is going outwards. We have to remain within  
our self - holding on just to 'I' alone.   
In Talks: 253: Bhagavan has said The illiterates are certainly better off than the  
literates whose egos are not destroyed by the quest of the self.   
355: "Illiteracy is ignorance: education is learned ignorance. Both of them  
are ignorant of their true aim; whereas a sage is not ignorant because there  
is no aim for him."   
D.: Mind itself is very subtle and is also the same as the Atman.   
How shall we know the nature of the mind? You have said that all   
supports are useless. What should be our stand then?   
M.: Where does your mind stand?   
D.: Where does it stand?   
M.: Ask the mind itself.   
D.: I ask you now. Should we concentrate on mind then?   
M.: Um!   
D.: But what is the nature of the mind? It is formless. The problem   
is perplexing.   
M.: Why are you perplexed?   
D.: The sastras want us to concentrate and I cannot do so.   
M.: Through what sastras have we known our existence?   
D.: It is a matter of experience. But I want to concentrate.   
M.: Be free from thoughts. Do not hold on to anything. They do not   
hold you. Be yourself.   
D.: I do not yet understand as to where I take my stand and concentrate.   
Can I meditate on my mind?   
M.: Whose mind?   
D.: My own mind?   
M.: Who are you? The question now resolves itself all right.   
(All retired for lunch. The visitor returned at 2-30 p.m. and pursued   
the same question.)   
He said: Maharshi advises the seeker to get rid of thoughts. On what   
should I concentrate the mind after all the thoughts are expelled? I   
do not see where I stand then and on what I should concentrate.   
M.: For whom is the concentration?   
D.: For the mind.   
M.: Then concentrate the mind.   
D.: On what?   
M.: Answer the question yourself. What is the mind? Why should   
you concentrate?   
D.: I do not know what the mind is. I ask Maharshi.   
M.: Maharshi does not seek to know the mind. The questioner must   
question the mind itself as to what it is.   
 **D.: Maharshi advises that the mind should be divested of thoughts.   
M.: This is itself a thought.**   
D.: When all thoughts disappear what remains over?   
M.: Is the mind different from thoughts?   
 **D.: No. The mind is made up of thoughts. My point is this: When all   
thoughts are got rid of, how shall I concentrate the mind?   
M.: Is not this also a thought?**   
D.: Yes, but I am advised to concentrate.   
M.: Why should you concentrate? Why should you not allow your   
thoughts free play?   
D.: The sastras say that the thoughts, thus playing free, lead us astray,   
that is, to unreal and changeful things.   
M.: So then, you want not to be led to unreal and changeful things. Your   
thoughts are unreal and changeful. You want to hold the Reality. That   
is exactly what I say. The thoughts are unreal. Get rid of them.   
 **D.: I understand now. Yet there is a doubt. Not a trice can you remain   
inactive. How shall I be able to rid myself of thoughts?   
M.: The same Gita says: Although all actions take place, I am not the doer.   
It is like the sun towards the world activities. The Self always remains   
actionless, whereas thoughts arise and subside. The Self is Perfection; it   
is immutable; the mind is limited and changeful. You need only to cast   
off your limitations. Your perfection thus stands revealed.**   
D.: Grace is necessary for it.   
 _ **M.: Grace is ever present. All that is necessary is that you surrender to  
It.**_   
D.: I surrender and pray that even if I go wrong I may be forcibly   
drawn to it.   
 **M.: Is this surrender? Surrender to be complete must be   
unquestioning.**   
D.: Yes, I surrender. You say I must dive into the ocean of the Self   
like a pearl-diver into the sea.   
M.: Because you are now thinking that you are out of the ocean of   
Consciousness.   
D.: I practise pranayama. It generates heat in the body. What should   
I do?   
M.: The heat will pass away when the mind gains calm   
D.: That is true but most difficult.   
 **M.: This is again a thought which is an obstacle.

I agree with Udai agru.   
Even Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami also says the same thing.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Mano Nasam means only destruction of  
ignorance in the mind but not destruction of mind.   
If really problems solve by killing our mind then it can be solved by taking  
some injection like anaesthesia. :-)   
So solution is to know that we are not the mind and it is mithya i.e dependent  
on our real naturre i.e sat-chit-ananda.

The point is : mind cannot be killed, coz its never alive to be killed.   
like the snake on a rope. should the snake be killed?   
i am awareness, right now -- there is no choice here.   
and as awareness, i "CANNOT" get sad, happy or anything else. AS AWareness, i  
a Every STillness.   
so its not "Be Still" \-- u R STILLNESS. .. no choice here!   
so when someone says "I WILL BE STILL" thats foolish. As Awareness there is no  
choice. One is STILLNESS ITSELF.   
AS mind, one cannot remain still... coz mind by nature is unreal. mind cannot  
become SAT.   
So, here is the problem. People want the mind to be Still... body to stop  
growing!! how is it ever possible.   
body by its nature has to grow old. mind by its nature has to change. Self  
cannot Change.   
This is the essence.   
Swami Suddhananda gives a nice example: Someone was asked "What is ur age", he  
said "30". "But u said the same thing 10 years ago", asked another who was  
present there. "That is right, i tell the truth and truth cannot change", was  
his reply!   
what kind of truth is that??   
The attempt to stop the mirage like world from appearing is also a mistake.  
coz it shall continue as long as one's prarabdha is there unfinished. no one  
can stop it.   
Love!

The very entity which also says that mind cannot be killed is mind itself.   
In the snake and rope example, snake is an illusion - Mithya and the rope is  
Asat.

Awareness is completely pure. Why is there a need to affirm that I am  
awareness? and to whom is this made?

yes. its mind that is saying.   
and that knowledge "u r awareness" is required for mind only.   
coz, the Self never needs this knowledge. Body cannot have it.   
Its very simple.   
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too?   
is not the instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for  
mind.   
MITHYA and ASAT have one basic difference. Mithya is like a mirage. it appears  
to be present, though its purely ASAT.   
So one cannot stop the appearance. it continues.

Dear I,   
In total agreement with your points, I would like to bring in my views in the  
same example quoted by you: Quote from: srkudai on June 28, 2010, 12:47:37 PM  
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too? is not the instruction "u r not this,  
but that which is outside", its for mind.   
Silence  
when the sage comes on the screen and says u are not this, you are not that  
and etc... and what ever you decide to do: 1 Stop the movie,   
2 continue the movie   
3 follow the sage   
4 not listen the sage   
5 do self enquiry   
6 letting the movie continue by allowing the assitant director to decide on  
the next scenarios believing that it cannot affect me, etc...   
these are still part of the movie itself. These are all the various courses  
the mind has, as options in the movie, as the director. These are "Freewill"  
which the i believes it has, which it can use to do what i wants to.   
Movie is in reality, not there at all, movie exist only for the mind alone  
which is non-self. In ignorance, the character itself, is the one which has  
created the movie and various scenarios and also the sage who comes and says  
you are not this you are that is just another character in the movie created  
by the mind again to make the movie more interesting, thats all.   
Once the character discards his dress knowing its limitedness - means there is  
no more i at all, no director at all, there is no more movie anymore. Movie  
existed only for the mithya i.   
The instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for mind." is  
itself just Mithya as well. It is just a story in the movie, which the i gets  
identified with whereby 'i' mistakenly takes these instruction for itself and  
begins to enquire who am i, I am the Self, I am this and I am that. these are  
all again just illusions. There is no need for self enquiry as well.   
There is no movie at all.   
Appearance is only for the 'i' mind alone. as long as the mind exists  
appearances will continue, as appearances are all the creations of the mind  
alone. Where there are no appearances and where only  
awareness/consciousness/Self alone IS, is real. _Where appearances still are_  
, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

It is not for. .... 'that' which does not need to affirm itself; says this

Dear Devotees,   
 I would like to share some of my views on various comments by forum members. Members comments are given in bold and my comments are in italics.   
1\. AWA is not Self enquiry since the moment the word watching is used, then  
the   
 subject object relation ship comes into picture and hence it cannot be the state of   
 BEING..Also how can awareness be watched?   
 _  
Comments: Mr. Michael Langford has mentioned that Awareness Watching  
Awareness is Awareness Being Awareness and he also says that because of long  
ancient habit of looking outwards towards people places and things, the word  
watching is used in practice instructions. Also he says that that way we take  
that same habit of watching people, places and things and we shut our eyes and  
turn it inwards. That is why the word watching is used. **Mr.Michael Langford  
says that what is real is awareness watching awareness, looking inward. What  
is unreal is looking outward towards the world of people places and things.  
Hence AWA is in line with Bjhagavans Self Enquiry   
**There are some comments in the forum that how can awareness be watched? If  
the word watching is inappropriate, then a doubt arises in mind how the  
word enquiry is appropriate in Self enquiry. When the word enquiry is used  
then doubt arises about who should enquire and whether self can be enquired  
and if self can be enquired then there must be enquirer similar to watcher in  
the word watching. All these doubts do not arise if tamil word SUMMA IRU is  
used to denote self enquiry**. Bhagavan ramana maharishi has instructed my  
mother around 80 years ago when she was a child that she should read  
Bhagavans works in the same language in which it was originally composed.I  
remember to have read some where that Bhagavan has given similar  
instructions to Annamalai Swami. Bhagavan has composed his great works such  
as   
 Nan Yar, Upadesa Undiar, Ulladhu Naarpathu,Arunachala Akshara mana malai etc  
in Tamil and when it is translated in other languages, it does not convey the  
same meaning as in tamil.. **In this context, I would like members to go  
through the commentary in English on Nan Yar by Mr.Michel James where in he  
uses the same original tamil words in many places in his commentary to  
ensure that the meaning is not distorted.**_   
[/b]   
2.As per AWA, it should be done on certain hours.   
 _Comments:Mr Michael Langford says that spend as many hours per day  
practicing as you can. **If you only practice awareness watching awareness for  
30 minutes per day and spend the other 23 and a half hours looking outward,  
you will not progress very quickly. If you want rapid results, then drop your  
unnecessary activities to free up time so you can practice for many hours per  
day, everyday. Maybe once per week on one of your days off from work you can  
devote the whole day to just practicing awareness watching awareness. Again  
this is in line with Bhagavans teachings that vichara should be done  
throughout the entire waking state   
**_ [/b]   
3.As per AWA, one should practice with eyes closed.   
 _Comments:To a question put to Bhagavan whether eyes should be open or not  
like this Bhagaan answers thus   
A: It may be done either way. The point is that the mind must be introverted  
and kept active in its pursuit. Sometimes it happens that when the eyes are  
closed the latent thoughts rush forth with great vigour. It may also be  
difficult to introvert the mind with the eyes open. It requires strength of  
mind to do so. The mind is contaminated when it takes in objects. Otherwise,  
it is pure. The main factor in dhyana is to keep the mind active in its own  
pursuit without taking in external impressions or thinking of other matters.   
 **From the very first sentence in Bhagavan s answer, it is evident that it  
may be done either way.**   
_   
4.As per AWA,ten methods are suggested and how can there be 10 methods since  
there is only one method, self attention or Summa irutthal. Being still.   
 _Comments: In Hinduism, four margas(paths) are prescribed for realization  
and devotees can follow any marga to reach the goal of Self realization. In  
Guru Ramana Mr.Cohen, quotes Bhagavan and says that the ultimate goal is  
realize the self and the paths are left to individuals. In fact, Bhagavan has  
told that Bakthi and Jnana are one and the same. In this context, I would like  
to quote an explanation given by late Paramacharya of Kanchi Mutt Sri  
Chandrasekara Saraswathi Swamigal. A devotee had a genuine doubt and asked  
Paramacharya why Paramacharya is confined to pujas and rituals and does not  
perform siddhis(miracles) like Sri. Sathya Sai Baba.. Paramacharya replied  
that the goal of his and Sri.Sathya Sa Baba are one and the same ie to bring  
everybody in to divinity and only difference is that they adopt different  
techniques like marketing people adopt different techniques to sell the goods.   
Bhagvan has given all the spiritual instructions very crystal clear and in  
simple language. In spite of that, during his life time, we can find devotees  
going on questioning about self enquiry again and again and this is evident  
if we go through the bookTalks wherein similar questions on self enquiry  
are repeated at number of places by different devotees. These devotees who put  
questions to hagavan are not ordinary layman but intellectuals and highly  
learned. **In order to cater to needs of people with different caliber,  
Micheal has given different methods and he is not suggested to follow all  
methods. It is left to individuals to follow the method which suits him  
best.This is in line with Bhagavan suggesting two methods ie doing sadhana  
with closed eyes and with open eyes. Which ever suits a devotee, he can follow  
it. Ultimately, the goal is to turn our attention inwards to the subject from  
objects.**   
 **All 10 methods suggested by Mr.Michael boils down to turning the  
attention inwards only and nothing else. Once a devotee becomes proficient in  
practice, he can practice sadhana eyes closed/open, one hour a day to 24  
hours a day,walking/sitting /laying/at rest room/ brushing his teeth. Only  
time he cannot do is while at sleep and when he is actively engaged in any  
work.When he is engaged in any serious activity, he automatically goes into  
meditation since his full attention is on that activity and there no  
thoughts**.   
**To conclude, I am fully convinced by Bhagavans teaching that at some  
point of time, we should forget what we have learned, stop reading books and  
turn our attention inwards. By mere reading various scriptures and endless  
discussion does not lead to realization unless we practice what we have  
learned.. To quote swami Sivananda of Rishikesh, an ounce of practice is  
better than tons of reading. In Sanskrit, it is known as Sravanam, mananam and  
Nithidyasanam and in Tirukkural, Tiruvallur says Karka Kashadara  
Karka.karrapin Nirka Thaga when means read and understand well and then  
practice what you have learnt. Do we[/b_**]?

It is the tendancy of our nature that we complicate things by not only our own  
analysis but also analysis of analyses itself.   
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
These are just tools for 'I' so that it can simply continue in the garb of  
spiritual enquiry and enjoy its existence. It does not at akk matter if  
awareness is watching awareness or awareness is not watching awareness,  
whether Ramana's teachings are same as Michal James or different, whether  
Bhakti yoga is same as Jnana Yoga or different. Whether my point is accepted  
here or rejected. whether the discussions is helping or not.   
'I' \- just hold on to it, everything else is play and only play: Merry-  
Go-Round   
Self Enquiry is like the passive observer. A classic example which Shankara  
Bhagavatpadal has given is that of the bird Dove which lays eggs and carefully  
guards it everyday and accumulates food for it from various places and when  
the eggs are going to hatch, one day the crow comes pushes the eggs down from  
the nest and eats all the eggs and just born dove. The dove, which comes there  
just sees all this without reaction. It just remains.   
Such should be our enquiry.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Here is the classic pic taken from the famous movie Adi Shankaracharya. Its  
one of the best examples as to how our enquiry has to be carried on: Crow and dove.Crow is the doer, the active one.The dove is the passive  
observer, the atman(inner self) - our attention should be always focussed only  
on this.   
instead of focusing our attention on the 'I', if the Dove begins to fight with  
the crow, it is only going to cause damage and loss of peace. Just remaining  
indifferent to what is happening, remaining in the world, carrying out our  
duties, we should remain like the Dove with our attention focused on the Self  
till our Prarabhha karma is dissolved.

Dear Mr.Nagaraj,   
 I agree with your comments as above.When we know that who am I is simply holding on to the "I", why so many posts in this forum on various headings on various topics?. **Bhagavan has given his first teaching "Naan Yar' crystal clear without any room for doubt and still do we require endless discussions on his teachings ?** **It is enough if only Bhagavan 's teachings alone are published in this site as being done by Sri Subramanian and Mr.Prasanth (Both of them are doing great service) and there are sufficient material for them to publish more of Bhagaan's works for many years**.This will help members who have not so far gone thro his books and for the one who has already gone through, it will help to refresh.Few years back, Swami Chinmayananda was invited to a Ramana function and was asked to deliver his talk on Bhagavan Ramana.He did not deliver lecture and instead sat in silence forsome time and at the end told the audience that this is what bhagavan's teaching. **Bhagavan says that Silence is ever speaking and it is interrupted by speaking.Are we following his teachings?

Dear viswanathan   
I agree with your detailed clarfifcations on the points of Michael   
Langford 'Awareness Watching Awareness'. The problems in   
any translation of the original work are that one has to compromise   
with some loss of beauty and cadence. A friend of mine, long time   
back, went to study Russian, to read Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace   
in original. But most of us cannot do that way. Why? Even Tamizhians today  
cannot properly read and understand classical   
Tamizh works like Bhagavan's ULLadu Narpadu. The untranslatatbility of Tamizh  
is quite high. In Tamizh, one often goes even without a verb. Nan Yaar means  
only "I Who" and not   
"Who am I?" Hence many problems have to be confronted by the   
translators. So long as Langford clarifies Watching means Being,   
then, as I already wrote, there is no problem. Even in Sanskrit,   
sometimes the word Darshan means not seeing but being. Siva darshan sometimes  
means Being Siva or Being in Sivam.   
As regards methods, again since every marga leads one ultimately to the one  
marga of self attention, there is no quarrel, in that sense.   
I also refer to Michael James as you have mentioned. He is the guy who read  
and mastered Tamizh while simultaneously venturing understanding and  
practicing Bhagavan Ramana's methods. Hence his books and translations are  
really of a higher order. In his   
Happiness and the Art of Being, he refers to ULLadu Narpadu   
verses and he always gives in italics the Tamizh word or phrases and again and  
again use many ways to describe the purport.   
Arunachala Siva.

OK   
How many of you tried "Awareness Watching Awareness" and found it different  
from Remaining as Self or Self inquiry?   
I tried it, and i see that its just the same. I do not find any difference.  
Whether one says, remain as Awareness within or Be Still, how does it matter?   
Its just the same!

Quote from: viswanathan on June 28, 2010, 03:16:39 AM

You are absolutely correct. The best course is to simply maintain silence. I  
have always found the tamizh works of Ramana more clearer than any of the  
other languages, it may be because it is my mother tongue, but I did not know  
how to read or write tamizh, but due to Bhagavan's grace, I am learning to  
read and write tamizh now atleast I am able to read it slowly though.   
Personally, I feel, Bhagavan's teachings are to be discussed within the Self  
alone, in the course of enquiry itself and not outside. One has to taste the  
tea himself to know its taste, no matter what elaboration anybody gives, is  
going to be of no avail.   
It is due to the Vasana of finding out answers to our questions that breeds  
questions and endless discussions. Bhagavans says, we need not know any  
answers at all. We fail to recognise the very presence of Bhagavan Ramana, if  
he is not there physically, does it mean that he is not going to clear our  
questions within? its because of this wrong notion, that we begin to discuss  
our issues or questions and it leads to analyses over analyses. What we need  
is a strong belief or Faith or Shraddha that Bhagavan will clear all doubts  
Himself and I need not ask anybody and that He himself will reveal it to me in  
any way, maybe an unknown person would come and say something in some other  
context, or through some incidents. We just need to remain alive and keep the  
enquiry always going. Like how Dhathathreya had 24 Gurus, most of them being  
animals, in a similar way, Bhagavan will bestow on us the clarity in some way  
or the other.   
To ask doubts and discussing it is going outwards. We have to remain within  
our self - holding on just to 'I' alone.   
In Talks: 253: Bhagavan has said The illiterates are certainly better off than the  
literates whose egos are not destroyed by the quest of the self.   
355: "Illiteracy is ignorance: education is learned ignorance. Both of them  
are ignorant of their true aim; whereas a sage is not ignorant because there  
is no aim for him."   
D.: Mind itself is very subtle and is also the same as the Atman.   
How shall we know the nature of the mind? You have said that all   
supports are useless. What should be our stand then?   
M.: Where does your mind stand?   
D.: Where does it stand?   
M.: Ask the mind itself.   
D.: I ask you now. Should we concentrate on mind then?   
M.: Um!   
D.: But what is the nature of the mind? It is formless. The problem   
is perplexing.   
M.: Why are you perplexed?   
D.: The sastras want us to concentrate and I cannot do so.   
M.: Through what sastras have we known our existence?   
D.: It is a matter of experience. But I want to concentrate.   
M.: Be free from thoughts. Do not hold on to anything. They do not   
hold you. Be yourself.   
D.: I do not yet understand as to where I take my stand and concentrate.   
Can I meditate on my mind?   
M.: Whose mind?   
D.: My own mind?   
M.: Who are you? The question now resolves itself all right.   
(All retired for lunch. The visitor returned at 2-30 p.m. and pursued   
the same question.)   
He said: Maharshi advises the seeker to get rid of thoughts. On what   
should I concentrate the mind after all the thoughts are expelled? I   
do not see where I stand then and on what I should concentrate.   
M.: For whom is the concentration?   
D.: For the mind.   
M.: Then concentrate the mind.   
D.: On what?   
M.: Answer the question yourself. What is the mind? Why should   
you concentrate?   
D.: I do not know what the mind is. I ask Maharshi.   
M.: Maharshi does not seek to know the mind. The questioner must   
question the mind itself as to what it is.   
 **D.: Maharshi advises that the mind should be divested of thoughts.   
M.: This is itself a thought.**   
D.: When all thoughts disappear what remains over?   
M.: Is the mind different from thoughts?   
 **D.: No. The mind is made up of thoughts. My point is this: When all   
thoughts are got rid of, how shall I concentrate the mind?   
M.: Is not this also a thought?**   
D.: Yes, but I am advised to concentrate.   
M.: Why should you concentrate? Why should you not allow your   
thoughts free play?   
D.: The sastras say that the thoughts, thus playing free, lead us astray,   
that is, to unreal and changeful things.   
M.: So then, you want not to be led to unreal and changeful things. Your   
thoughts are unreal and changeful. You want to hold the Reality. That   
is exactly what I say. The thoughts are unreal. Get rid of them.   
 **D.: I understand now. Yet there is a doubt. Not a trice can you remain   
inactive. How shall I be able to rid myself of thoughts?   
M.: The same Gita says: Although all actions take place, I am not the doer.   
It is like the sun towards the world activities. The Self always remains   
actionless, whereas thoughts arise and subside. The Self is Perfection; it   
is immutable; the mind is limited and changeful. You need only to cast   
off your limitations. Your perfection thus stands revealed.**   
D.: Grace is necessary for it.   
 _ **M.: Grace is ever present. All that is necessary is that you surrender to  
It.**_   
D.: I surrender and pray that even if I go wrong I may be forcibly   
drawn to it.   
 **M.: Is this surrender? Surrender to be complete must be   
unquestioning.**   
D.: Yes, I surrender. You say I must dive into the ocean of the Self   
like a pearl-diver into the sea.   
M.: Because you are now thinking that you are out of the ocean of   
Consciousness.

I do?

Thought is an obstacle if i am moving in the thought world.   
how can thought obstruct the Self?   
how can a building obstruct the space?   
I am not saying Sri Ramana is wrong.   
i am just saying, the person who recorded it might not have done it all that  
well!

I agree with Udai agru.   
Even Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami also says the same thing.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Mano Nasam means only destruction of  
ignorance in the mind but not destruction of mind.   
If really problems solve by killing our mind then it can be solved by taking  
some injection like anaesthesia. :-)   
So solution is to know that we are not the mind and it is mithya i.e dependent  
on our real naturre i.e sat-chit-ananda.

Dear I,   
I would rather put it this way: When the glass tumbler is half filled with water. One says its half filled and  
the other says its half empty.   
Thats all is the difference.

The point is : mind cannot be killed, coz its never alive to be killed.   
like the snake on a rope. should the snake be killed?   
i am awareness, right now -- there is no choice here.   
and as awareness, i "CANNOT" get sad, happy or anything else. AS AWareness, i  
a Every STillness.   
so its not "Be Still" \-- u R STILLNESS. .. no choice here!   
so when someone says "I WILL BE STILL" thats foolish. As Awareness there is no  
choice. One is STILLNESS ITSELF.   
AS mind, one cannot remain still... coz mind by nature is unreal. mind cannot  
become SAT.   
So, here is the problem. People want the mind to be Still... body to stop  
growing!! how is it ever possible.   
body by its nature has to grow old. mind by its nature has to change. Self  
cannot Change.   
This is the essence.   
Swami Suddhananda gives a nice example: Someone was asked "What is ur age", he  
said "30". "But u said the same thing 10 years ago", asked another who was  
present there. "That is right, i tell the truth and truth cannot change", was  
his reply!   
what kind of truth is that??   
The attempt to stop the mirage like world from appearing is also a mistake.  
coz it shall continue as long as one's prarabdha is there unfinished. no one  
can stop it.   
Love!   
Silence

The very entity which also says that mind cannot be killed is mind itself.   
In the snake and rope example, snake is an illusion - Mithya and the rope is  
Asat.

Awareness is completely pure. Why is there a need to affirm that I am  
awareness? and to whom is this made?

yes. its mind that is saying.   
and that knowledge "u r awareness" is required for mind only.   
coz, the Self never needs this knowledge. Body cannot have it.   
Its very simple.   
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too?   
is not the instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for  
mind.   
MITHYA and ASAT have one basic difference. Mithya is like a mirage. it appears  
to be present, though its purely ASAT.   
So one cannot stop the appearance. it continues.

Dear I,   
In total agreement with your points, I would like to bring in my views in the  
same example quoted by you: Quote from: srkudai on June 28, 2010, 12:47:37 PM  
suppose i am watching a movie and have taken myself to be a character in it  
and am suffering. So, a sage comes on the screen and says "U r not this, u r  
that, and points his finger out". .. and if i just get out! Do i have to stop  
the movie?   
is not the teaching in the movie too? is not the instruction "u r not this,  
but that which is outside", its for mind.   
Silence  
when the sage comes on the screen and says u are not this, you are not that  
and etc... and what ever you decide to do: 1 Stop the movie,   
2 continue the movie   
3 follow the sage   
4 not listen the sage   
5 do self enquiry   
6 letting the movie continue by allowing the assitant director to decide on  
the next scenarios believing that it cannot affect me, etc...   
these are still part of the movie itself. These are all the various courses  
the mind has, as options in the movie, as the director. These are "Freewill"  
which the i believes it has, which it can use to do what i wants to.   
Movie is in reality, not there at all, movie exist only for the mind alone  
which is non-self. In ignorance, the character itself, is the one which has  
created the movie and various scenarios and also the sage who comes and says  
you are not this you are that is just another character in the movie created  
by the mind again to make the movie more interesting, thats all.   
Once the character discards his dress knowing its limitedness - means there is  
no more i at all, no director at all, there is no more movie anymore. Movie  
existed only for the mithya i.   
The instruction "u r not this, but that which is outside", its for mind." is  
itself just Mithya as well. It is just a story in the movie, which the i gets  
identified with whereby 'i' mistakenly takes these instruction for itself and  
begins to enquire who am i, I am the Self, I am this and I am that. these are  
all again just illusions. There is no need for self enquiry as well.   
There is no movie at all.   
Appearance is only for the 'i' mind alone. as long as the mind exists  
appearances will continue, as appearances are all the creations of the mind  
alone. Where there are no appearances and where only  
awareness/consciousness/Self alone IS, is real. _Where appearances still are_  
, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.

Dear prasanth and others,   
The problem is that we are not able to visualize a state where the   
mind is killed. Mind-killing seems to be bothering most of us.   
If you substitute ego with mind, then, we are comfortable. Everyone   
agrees that one should kill the ego. Bhagavan Ramana also concludes   
ULLadu Narpadu by saying, Ahandhai uru azhitale mukti. The destruction of the  
ego is liberation. But Bhagavan Ramana uses   
the phrase mano-nasam in Who am I? He does not say Ahandai nasam. For that  
matter, He never uses the word Ahandai, ego   
in Who am I? directly. This is a poser for all of us! However, He gives one  
description about ahandai or ahankaram in Who am I? He says that "I-thought  
is the first thought from the mind. And this ahankaram."   
Arunachala Siva.

Yes . There is no movie at all. But that does not mean the appearance has to  
change.   
These words are not there... whether u see them or not   
Quote  
Where appearances still are, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.   
Ramana was seeing all this. But not "inquiring". He was Just Being.   
For one who falls into the thoughts, who is thinking he is the doer. ..  
"inquire" is suggested.   
so, inquiry is not as long as the world appears. it is as long as one is  
thinks one is not the Self: Just Be.   
Ramana saw all this. Everything.

Dear Subramanian,   
Suppose i am playing the role of Ravana and take myself to be Ravana. I am  
Ravana is ego. I am Self is Truth.   
I am Ravana. .. as a Role.   
I am Self. .. As the Ultimate.   
The Role of Ravana need not be destroyed. If I do not know i am Ravana, i  
cannot play that role.   
I just have to know that I am Self [mentally]. And have firm conviction.   
There it ends.   
nothing more, nothing less.   
That is why Ramakrishna says "the ego is like a burnt rope", coz it no more  
creates confusion. there is clarity. i know i am playing the role of Ravana  
but all this is mithya. This is simple.   
Love!

Yes. Ego is Ravana. As SRK said that it will be a burnt-rope,   
only when it is burnt and not otherwise. When ego is burnt,   
then there is no more role playing, because one is Rama, ever

Quote from: Nagaraj on June 27, 2010, 01:17:46 PM  
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
In the above quote,Mr.Nagaraj has introduced the word "Echils"-food split down  
from the mouth and i thought share some good and ad aspects of "Echil".. In  
tamil this word commonly refers to saliva which we spit..Also, any food left  
over in the plate by the eater is also called "Echils" and is considered  
impure and and unhygienic for others to eat. The people who eat left over  
food(Echils)are looked down in society and also sometimes ridiculed..However,  
it is a a common sight in marriages that the food left over on the plate  
will be thrown in dust bin and will be collected by poorest of poor  
especially gypsies(Narikoravas) to satisfy their hunger.Also the left over  
food thrown in dust bin will be shared by dogs and other animals who are not  
fortunate as us.. In the orthodox brahmin families it is still a practice  
wherein the husband will eat first and the plate will not be washed and will  
have some left over food and in the same plate wife will be served food and  
here the "Echils" is very much nourished by the wife taken as prasad from  
husband and that "Echil" is not considered as unhygienic..However the same  
parent will not approve their children sharing "Echils".During Bhagavan days,  
some of orthodox devotees will wait till Bhagavan finishes eating and when he  
leaves dining hall, they will rush to collect the "Echil"(food left in  
hagavan's plate) and eat it as Bhagavan's prasad. When Bhagavan came to know  
of this practice, he did not approve of this.There was a well known saint by  
name Poondi Swamiyar wherein devotees will eat the food tasted by Poondi  
Swamiar and here "Echil" was very considered as divine and was very much  
respected.In swami suddhananda's ashram, Swami used to advice devotees in  
dining hall to leave some food("Echils") in plate for the animals in the  
ashram.   
During last days of Sri.Ramakrishna Paramahamsha, he was suffering with  
Cancer which was in advanced state.His closest aides who were were serving him  
were afraid to go near him fearing that they will also contract cancer and  
left him.On seeing this, Swami Vivekananda took a glass of liquid and gave it  
to Sri ramakrishna to drink and then Swami Vivekananda drank the left  
over(Echil) in the glass.On seeing this, Sri Ramakrishna's close aides got  
over the fear of Contracting Cancer and started serving him again.

Quote from: srkudai on June 29, 2010, 07:54:26 AM  
When ego is burnt, still there is role playing, but one knows clearly that one  
is not ravana.   
why should an enlightened person not continue playing the role of Ravana,  
knowing pretty well that there is only Rama?   
Appearances are only projection of the mind, similarly, Ravana is a character  
projected by the mind. When the mind is merged into itself - Self, Ravana  
ceases to be, as there will be no mind for projection of Ravana.   
You have to remain as Rama (actually not even reamaing, you are 'that' Tat  
Tvam Asi), There is no way you can continue playing the role of Ravana, that  
implies that mind is still there.   
Once the mind is merged into Self, there will/should not be any appearances,  
i.e. no more any projections. There will only be Rama and Rama everywhere. No  
more roles, characters, etc...   
If it is so, that the Ravana role continues, and even if that role does not  
affect us as Rama, then still it is only projection of the Mind. Therefore  
Mind has still not merged.   
After enlightenment, realising that the cinema is not real, why do you still  
want to sit and watch the movie that is not there? movie still being continued  
- do you not think that still mind is there projecting the universe?   
Mind has to merge, this is Mano Naasam! which is - absolutely no projections  
at all and no continuing of movies or characters or is it even the  
enlightenment that the roles can continue and that it cannot affect you  
anymore.   
These are my humble views

Dear Nagaraj,   
 When there is no projection what so ever, its release from body as well. coz body too is a projection.   
as long as there is functioning, there is mind and there are projections. the  
projections continue as per prarabdha   
and then the person ends. along with all projections.   
Love!

A Jeevan Muktha is said to have had release from body and still exist in the  
body for **outsiders** like ourselves. It is Videha muktha what you are  
talking about.   
In Sadashiva Brahmendral, we have seen how his hands were chopped off and yet  
he continued to walk without even being aware of it. We all know how Ramana  
Maharshi had his tumor operated without even taking anesthesia.   
It only appears for outsiders like ourselves that a Jivanmukta has prarabdha,  
that they have body, etc.., but they do not have any prarabdha or body.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

videha muktha is released from body. jeevan mukha has body.   
The jnani who said "I do not have body" is also appears to others only.   
When a person is in the influence of drugs u can try cutting off their body  
parts and they may move unconcerned.   
all these have happened in your view. in your peception.   
so lets speak from your perception.   
Does the jnani say u have a body? he says u too do not have a body. infact he  
says there is no u!   
and yet he is speaking. if u ask, the reply is "in ur view i am speaking to  
u".   
then how come u say a jeevan muktha has no body? No one has a body that way.   
so there is no projection even now!   
but u speak of ending a projection! which means u have already assumed there  
is a projection.   
if there is a projection, that is in ur view. then that projection ends after  
videha mukti. .. that too in your view.   
we can only speak from our standpoint. A Jeevan muktha has body and a Videha  
muktha has no body.

Dear I,   
Every thing that is being discussed is only a 'stand point' of view, which is  
only the mind's. It can never know the consciousness which is unlimited.  
whatever we try and say is only making it limited.   
A Jivan Mukta does not have a body, as consciousness, 'it' is pervaded  
everywhere and everything. No one has body. since it is projection of mind, it  
exists as sanke in rope.   
In the end, you speak from your perception and I speak from my perception.   
There is no your perception and my perception. You are talking to yourself and  
I am talking to myself. There is no You and I.   
Perception exists only for the mind. Perception is again just a projection. as  
long as the Mind exists, perception, projection, etc.. continues. When, Mano  
Naasam, all is naught.   
The games of your perception, my perception etc.. continue for the mind, is it  
not the projection of the mind?   
Quote  
we can only speak from our standpoint. A Jeevan muktha has body and a Videha  
muktha has no body.  
That everything is only the projection of the mind including the Jivanmukta  
and Videhamukta. When Mano Naasam, there is no Jivanmukta, no Videhamukta, No  
consciousness, no nothing or there is Jivanmukta, there is Videhamukta,  
Consciousness everywhere, Aatman, Brahman.   
These are all again the projections of mind.   
This mind as to merge. this is Mano naasam. As long as there are projections  
of any type, mind has not merged.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

there are only two possibilities: A person with merged mind said this. which  
is not possible. coz for him all projections ceased.   
a person whose mind is not merged is saying what will happen when mind merges.  
in this case, how does he know?   
both cases are meaningless.   
simple point... merging of mind is not absence of projection. its just veiling

Dear prasanth and others,   
The problem is that we are not able to visualize a state where the   
mind is killed. Mind-killing seems to be bothering most of us.   
If you substitute ego with mind, then, we are comfortable. Everyone   
agrees that one should kill the ego. Bhagavan Ramana also concludes   
ULLadu Narpadu by saying, Ahandhai uru azhitale mukti. The destruction of the  
ego is liberation. But Bhagavan Ramana uses   
the phrase mano-nasam in Who am I? He does not say Ahandai nasam. For that  
matter, He never uses the word Ahandai, ego   
in Who am I? directly. This is a poser for all of us! However, He gives one  
description about ahandai or ahankaram in Who am I? He says that "I-thought  
is the first thought from the mind. And this ahankaram."   
Arunachala Siva.

Yes . There is no movie at all. But that does not mean the appearance has to  
change.   
These words are not there... whether u see them or not   
Quote  
Where appearances still are, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.   
Ramana was seeing all this. But not "inquiring". He was Just Being.   
For one who falls into the thoughts, who is thinking he is the doer. ..  
"inquire" is suggested.   
so, inquiry is not as long as the world appears. it is as long as one is  
thinks one is not the Self: Just Be.   
Ramana saw all this. Everything.

Dear Subramanian,   
Suppose i am playing the role of Ravana and take myself to be Ravana. I am  
Ravana is ego. I am Self is Truth.   
I am Ravana. .. as a Role.   
I am Self. .. As the Ultimate.   
The Role of Ravana need not be destroyed. If I do not know i am Ravana, i  
cannot play that role.   
I just have to know that I am Self [mentally]. And have firm conviction.   
There it ends.   
nothing more, nothing less.   
That is why Ramakrishna says "the ego is like a burnt rope", coz it no more  
creates confusion. there is clarity. i know i am playing the role of Ravana  
but all this is mithya. This is simple.   
Love!

Quote from: Nagaraj on June 27, 2010, 01:17:46 PM  
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
In the above quote,Mr.Nagaraj has introduced the word "Echils"-food split down  
from the mouth and i thought share some good and ad aspects of "Echil".. In  
tamil this word commonly refers to saliva which we spit..Also, any food left  
over in the plate by the eater is also called "Echils" and is considered  
impure and and unhygienic for others to eat. The people who eat left over  
food(Echils)are looked down in society and also sometimes ridiculed..However,  
it is a a common sight in marriages that the food left over on the plate  
will be thrown in dust bin and will be collected by poorest of poor  
especially gypsies(Narikoravas) to satisfy their hunger.Also the left over  
food thrown in dust bin will be shared by dogs and other animals who are not  
fortunate as us.. In the orthodox brahmin families it is still a practice  
wherein the husband will eat first and the plate will not be washed and will  
have some left over food and in the same plate wife will be served food and  
here the "Echils" is very much nourished by the wife taken as prasad from  
husband and that "Echil" is not considered as unhygienic..However the same  
parent will not approve their children sharing "Echils".During Bhagavan days,  
some of orthodox devotees will wait till Bhagavan finishes eating and when he  
leaves dining hall, they will rush to collect the "Echil"(food left in  
hagavan's plate) and eat it as Bhagavan's prasad. When Bhagavan came to know  
of this practice, he did not approve of this.There was a well known saint by  
name Poondi Swamiyar wherein devotees will eat the food tasted by Poondi  
Swamiar and here "Echil" was very considered as divine and was very much  
respected.In swami suddhananda's ashram, Swami used to advice devotees in  
dining hall to leave some food("Echils") in plate for the animals in the  
ashram.   
During last days of Sri.Ramakrishna Paramahamsha, he was suffering with  
Cancer which was in advanced state.His closest aides who were were serving him  
were afraid to go near him fearing that they will also contract cancer and  
left him.On seeing this, Swami Vivekananda took a glass of liquid and gave it  
to Sri ramakrishna to drink and then Swami Vivekananda drank the left  
over(Echil) in the glass.On seeing this, Sri Ramakrishna's close aides got  
over the fear of Contracting Cancer and started serving him again.

Quote from: srkudai on June 29, 2010, 07:54:26 AM  
When ego is burnt, still there is role playing, but one knows clearly that one  
is not ravana.   
why should an enlightened person not continue playing the role of Ravana,  
knowing pretty well that there is only Rama?   
Appearances are only projection of the mind, similarly, Ravana is a character  
projected by the mind. When the mind is merged into itself - Self, Ravana  
ceases to be, as there will be no mind for projection of Ravana.   
You have to remain as Rama (actually not even reamaing, you are 'that' Tat  
Tvam Asi), There is no way you can continue playing the role of Ravana, that  
implies that mind is still there.   
Once the mind is merged into Self, there will/should not be any appearances,  
i.e. no more any projections. There will only be Rama and Rama everywhere. No  
more roles, characters, etc...   
If it is so, that the Ravana role continues, and even if that role does not  
affect us as Rama, then still it is only projection of the Mind. Therefore  
Mind has still not merged.   
After enlightenment, realising that the cinema is not real, why do you still  
want to sit and watch the movie that is not there? movie still being continued  
- do you not think that still mind is there projecting the universe?   
Mind has to merge, this is Mano Naasam! which is - absolutely no projections  
at all and no continuing of movies or characters or is it even the  
enlightenment that the roles can continue and that it cannot affect you  
anymore.   
These are my humble views

Dear I,   
Every thing that is being discussed is only a 'stand point' of view, which is  
only the mind's. It can never know the consciousness which is unlimited.  
whatever we try and say is only making it limited.   
A Jivan Mukta does not have a body, as consciousness, 'it' is pervaded  
everywhere and everything. No one has body. since it is projection of mind, it  
exists as sanke in rope.   
In the end, you speak from your perception and I speak from my perception.   
There is no your perception and my perception. You are talking to yourself and  
I am talking to myself. There is no You and I.   
Perception exists only for the mind. Perception is again just a projection. as  
long as the Mind exists, perception, projection, etc.. continues. When, Mano  
Naasam, all is naught.   
The games of your perception, my perception etc.. continue for the mind, is it  
not the projection of the mind?   
Quote  
we can only speak from our standpoint. A Jeevan muktha has body and a Videha  
muktha has no body.  
That everything is only the projection of the mind including the Jivanmukta  
and Videhamukta. When Mano Naasam, there is no Jivanmukta, no Videhamukta, No  
consciousness, no nothing or there is Jivanmukta, there is Videhamukta,  
Consciousness everywhere, Aatman, Brahman.   
These are all again the projections of mind.   
This mind as to merge. this is Mano naasam. As long as there are projections  
of any type, mind has not merged.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

there are only two possibilities: A person with merged mind said this. which  
is not possible. coz for him all projections ceased.   
a person whose mind is not merged is saying what will happen when mind merges.  
in this case, how does he know?   
both cases are meaningless.   
simple point... merging of mind is not absence of projection. its just veiling  
power that is eliminated.   
final merging or elimination of projection is videha mukti. not jeevan mukthi.

Dear prasanth and others,   
The problem is that we are not able to visualize a state where the   
mind is killed. Mind-killing seems to be bothering most of us.   
If you substitute ego with mind, then, we are comfortable. Everyone   
agrees that one should kill the ego. Bhagavan Ramana also concludes   
ULLadu Narpadu by saying, Ahandhai uru azhitale mukti. The destruction of the  
ego is liberation. But Bhagavan Ramana uses   
the phrase mano-nasam in Who am I? He does not say Ahandai nasam. For that  
matter, He never uses the word Ahandai, ego   
in Who am I? directly. This is a poser for all of us! However, He gives one  
description about ahandai or ahankaram in Who am I? He says that "I-thought  
is the first thought from the mind. And this ahankaram."   
Arunachala Siva.

Yes . There is no movie at all. But that does not mean the appearance has to  
change.   
These words are not there... whether u see them or not   
Quote  
Where appearances still are, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.   
Ramana was seeing all this. But not "inquiring". He was Just Being.   
For one who falls into the thoughts, who is thinking he is the doer. ..  
"inquire" is suggested.   
so, inquiry is not as long as the world appears. it is as long as one is  
thinks one is not the Self: Just Be.   
Ramana saw all this. Everything.

Dear Subramanian,   
Suppose i am playing the role of Ravana and take myself to be Ravana. I am  
Ravana is ego. I am Self is Truth.   
I am Ravana. .. as a Role.   
I am Self. .. As the Ultimate.   
The Role of Ravana need not be destroyed. If I do not know i am Ravana, i  
cannot play that role.   
I just have to know that I am Self [mentally]. And have firm conviction.   
There it ends.   
nothing more, nothing less.   
That is why Ramakrishna says "the ego is like a burnt rope", coz it no more  
creates confusion. there is clarity. i know i am playing the role of Ravana  
but all this is mithya. This is simple.   
Love!

Dear srkudai,   
Yes. Ego is Ravana. As SRK said that it will be a burnt-rope,   
only when it is burnt and not otherwise. When ego is burnt,   
then there is no more role playing, because one is Rama, ever   
and unchanging.

Quote from: Nagaraj on June 27, 2010, 01:17:46 PM  
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
In the above quote,Mr.Nagaraj has introduced the word "Echils"-food split down  
from the mouth and i thought share some good and ad aspects of "Echil".. In  
tamil this word commonly refers to saliva which we spit..Also, any food left  
over in the plate by the eater is also called "Echils" and is considered  
impure and and unhygienic for others to eat. The people who eat left over  
food(Echils)are looked down in society and also sometimes ridiculed..However,  
it is a a common sight in marriages that the food left over on the plate  
will be thrown in dust bin and will be collected by poorest of poor  
especially gypsies(Narikoravas) to satisfy their hunger.Also the left over  
food thrown in dust bin will be shared by dogs and other animals who are not  
fortunate as us.. In the orthodox brahmin families it is still a practice  
wherein the husband will eat first and the plate will not be washed and will  
have some left over food and in the same plate wife will be served food and  
here the "Echils" is very much nourished by the wife taken as prasad from  
husband and that "Echil" is not considered as unhygienic..However the same  
parent will not approve their children sharing "Echils".During Bhagavan days,  
some of orthodox devotees will wait till Bhagavan finishes eating and when he  
leaves dining hall, they will rush to collect the "Echil"(food left in  
hagavan's plate) and eat it as Bhagavan's prasad. When Bhagavan came to know  
of this practice, he did not approve of this.There was a well known saint by  
name Poondi Swamiyar wherein devotees will eat the food tasted by Poondi  
Swamiar and here "Echil" was very considered as divine and was very much  
respected.In swami suddhananda's ashram, Swami used to advice devotees in  
dining hall to leave some food("Echils") in plate for the animals in the  
ashram.   
During last days of Sri.Ramakrishna Paramahamsha, he was suffering with  
Cancer which was in advanced state.His closest aides who were were serving him  
were afraid to go near him fearing that they will also contract cancer and  
left him.On seeing this, Swami Vivekananda took a glass of liquid and gave it  
to Sri ramakrishna to drink and then Swami Vivekananda drank the left  
over(Echil) in the glass.On seeing this, Sri Ramakrishna's close aides got  
over the fear of Contracting Cancer and started serving him again.

Appearances are only projection of the mind, similarly, Ravana is a character  
projected by the mind. When the mind is merged into itself - Self, Ravana  
ceases to be, as there will be no mind for projection of Ravana.   
You have to remain as Rama (actually not even reamaing, you are 'that' Tat  
Tvam Asi), There is no way you can continue playing the role of Ravana, that  
implies that mind is still there.   
Once the mind is merged into Self, there will/should not be any appearances,  
i.e. no more any projections. There will only be Rama and Rama everywhere. No  
more roles, characters, etc...   
If it is so, that the Ravana role continues, and even if that role does not  
affect us as Rama, then still it is only projection of the Mind. Therefore  
Mind has still not merged.   
After enlightenment, realising that the cinema is not real, why do you still  
want to sit and watch the movie that is not there? movie still being continued  
- do you not think that still mind is there projecting the universe?   
Mind has to merge, this is Mano Naasam! which is - absolutely no projections  
at all and no continuing of movies or characters or is it even the  
enlightenment that the roles can continue and that it cannot affect you  
anymore.   
These are my humble views

Dear Nagaraj,   
 When there is no projection what so ever, its release from body as well. coz body too is a projection.   
as long as there is functioning, there is mind and there are projections. the  
projections continue as per prarabdha   
and then the person ends. along with all projections.

A Jeevan Muktha is said to have had release from body and still exist in the  
body for **outsiders** like ourselves. It is Videha muktha what you are  
talking about.   
In Sadashiva Brahmendral, we have seen how his hands were chopped off and yet  
he continued to walk without even being aware of it. We all know how Ramana  
Maharshi had his tumor operated without even taking anesthesia.   
It only appears for outsiders like ourselves that a Jivanmukta has prarabdha,  
that they have body, etc.., but they do not have any prarabdha or body.

videha muktha is released from body. jeevan mukha has body.   
The jnani who said "I do not have body" is also appears to others only.   
When a person is in the influence of drugs u can try cutting off their body  
parts and they may move unconcerned.   
all these have happened in your view. in your peception.   
so lets speak from your perception.   
Does the jnani say u have a body? he says u too do not have a body. infact he  
says there is no u!   
and yet he is speaking. if u ask, the reply is "in ur view i am speaking to  
u".   
then how come u say a jeevan muktha has no body? No one has a body that way.   
so there is no projection even now!   
but u speak of ending a projection! which means u have already assumed there  
is a projection.   
if there is a projection, that is in ur view. then that projection ends after  
videha mukti. .. that too in your view.   
we can only speak from our standpoint. A Jeevan muktha has body and a Videha  
muktha has no body.

there are only two possibilities: A person with merged mind said this. which

Dear prasanth and others,   
The problem is that we are not able to visualize a state where the   
mind is killed. Mind-killing seems to be bothering most of us.   
If you substitute ego with mind, then, we are comfortable. Everyone   
agrees that one should kill the ego. Bhagavan Ramana also concludes   
ULLadu Narpadu by saying, Ahandhai uru azhitale mukti. The destruction of the  
ego is liberation. But Bhagavan Ramana uses   
the phrase mano-nasam in Who am I? He does not say Ahandai nasam. For that  
matter, He never uses the word Ahandai, ego   
in Who am I? directly. This is a poser for all of us! However, He gives one  
description about ahandai or ahankaram in Who am I? He says that "I-thought  
is the first thought from the mind. And this ahankaram."   
Arunachala Siva.

Yes . There is no movie at all. But that does not mean the appearance has to  
change.   
These words are not there... whether u see them or not   
Quote  
Where appearances still are, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.   
Ramana was seeing all this. But not "inquiring". He was Just Being.   
For one who falls into the thoughts, who is thinking he is the doer. ..  
"inquire" is suggested.   
so, inquiry is not as long as the world appears. it is as long as one is  
thinks one is not the Self: Just Be.   
Ramana saw all this. Everything.

Dear Subramanian,   
Suppose i am playing the role of Ravana and take myself to be Ravana. I am  
Ravana is ego. I am Self is Truth.   
I am Ravana. .. as a Role.   
I am Self. .. As the Ultimate.   
The Role of Ravana need not be destroyed. If I do not know i am Ravana, i  
cannot play that role.   
I just have to know that I am Self [mentally]. And have firm conviction.   
There it ends.   
nothing more, nothing less.   
That is why Ramakrishna says "the ego is like a burnt rope", coz it no more  
creates confusion. there is clarity. i know i am playing the role of Ravana  
but all this is mithya. This is simple.   
Love!

Dear srkudai,   
Yes. Ego is Ravana. As SRK said that it will be a burnt-rope,   
only when it is burnt and not otherwise. When ego is burnt,   
then there is no more role playing, because one is Rama, ever   
and unchanging.

Quote from: Nagaraj on June 27, 2010, 01:17:46 PM  
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
In the above quote,Mr.Nagaraj has introduced the word "Echils"-food split down  
from the mouth and i thought share some good and ad aspects of "Echil".. In  
tamil this word commonly refers to saliva which we spit..Also, any food left  
over in the plate by the eater is also called "Echils" and is considered  
impure and and unhygienic for others to eat. The people who eat left over  
food(Echils)are looked down in society and also sometimes ridiculed..However,  
it is a a common sight in marriages that the food left over on the plate  
will be thrown in dust bin and will be collected by poorest of poor  
especially gypsies(Narikoravas) to satisfy their hunger.Also the left over  
food thrown in dust bin will be shared by dogs and other animals who are not  
fortunate as us.. In the orthodox brahmin families it is still a practice  
wherein the husband will eat first and the plate will not be washed and will  
have some left over food and in the same plate wife will be served food and  
here the "Echils" is very much nourished by the wife taken as prasad from  
husband and that "Echil" is not considered as unhygienic..However the same  
parent will not approve their children sharing "Echils".During Bhagavan days,  
some of orthodox devotees will wait till Bhagavan finishes eating and when he  
leaves dining hall, they will rush to collect the "Echil"(food left in  
hagavan's plate) and eat it as Bhagavan's prasad. When Bhagavan came to know  
of this practice, he did not approve of this.There was a well known saint by  
name Poondi Swamiyar wherein devotees will eat the food tasted by Poondi  
Swamiar and here "Echil" was very considered as divine and was very much  
respected.In swami suddhananda's ashram, Swami used to advice devotees in  
dining hall to leave some food("Echils") in plate for the animals in the  
ashram.   
During last days of Sri.Ramakrishna Paramahamsha, he was suffering with  
Cancer which was in advanced state.His closest aides who were were serving him  
were afraid to go near him fearing that they will also contract cancer and  
left him.On seeing this, Swami Vivekananda took a glass of liquid and gave it  
to Sri ramakrishna to drink and then Swami Vivekananda drank the left  
over(Echil) in the glass.On seeing this, Sri Ramakrishna's close aides got  
over the fear of Contracting Cancer and started serving him again.

Quote from: srkudai on June 29, 2010, 07:54:26 AM

Appearances are only projection of the mind, similarly, Ravana is a character  
projected by the mind. When the mind is merged into itself - Self, Ravana  
ceases to be, as there will be no mind for projection of Ravana.   
You have to remain as Rama (actually not even reamaing, you are 'that' Tat  
Tvam Asi), There is no way you can continue playing the role of Ravana, that  
implies that mind is still there.   
Once the mind is merged into Self, there will/should not be any appearances,  
i.e. no more any projections. There will only be Rama and Rama everywhere. No  
more roles, characters, etc...   
If it is so, that the Ravana role continues, and even if that role does not  
affect us as Rama, then still it is only projection of the Mind. Therefore  
Mind has still not merged.   
After enlightenment, realising that the cinema is not real, why do you still  
want to sit and watch the movie that is not there? movie still being continued  
- do you not think that still mind is there projecting the universe?   
Mind has to merge, this is Mano Naasam! which is - absolutely no projections  
at all and no continuing of movies or characters or is it even the  
enlightenment that the roles can continue and that it cannot affect you  
anymore.   
These are my humble views   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
 When there is no projection what so ever, its release from body as well. coz body too is a projection.   
as long as there is functioning, there is mind and there are projections. the  
projections continue as per prarabdha   
and then the person ends. along with all projections.   
Love!

A Jeevan Muktha is said to have had release from body and still exist in the  
body for **outsiders** like ourselves. It is Videha muktha what you are  
talking about.   
In Sadashiva Brahmendral, we have seen how his hands were chopped off and yet  
he continued to walk without even being aware of it. We all know how Ramana  
Maharshi had his tumor operated without even taking anesthesia.   
It only appears for outsiders like ourselves that a Jivanmukta has prarabdha,  
that they have body, etc.., but they do not have any prarabdha or body.

videha muktha is released from body. jeevan mukha has body.   
The jnani who said "I do not have body" is also appears to others only.   
When a person is in the influence of drugs u can try cutting off their body  
parts and they may move unconcerned.   
all these have happened in your view. in your peception.   
so lets speak from your perception.   
Does the jnani say u have a body? he says u too do not have a body. infact he  
says there is no u!   
and yet he is speaking. if u ask, the reply is "in ur view i am speaking to  
u".   
then how come u say a jeevan muktha has no body? No one has a body that way.   
so there is no projection even now!   
but u speak of ending a projection! which means u have already assumed there  
is a projection.   
if there is a projection, that is in ur view. then that projection ends after  
videha mukti. .. that too in your view.   
we can only speak from our standpoint. A Jeevan muktha has body and a Videha  
muktha has no body.

Dear I,   
Every thing that is being discussed is only a 'stand point' of view, which is  
only the mind's. It can never know the consciousness which is unlimited.  
whatever we try and say is only making it limited.   
A Jivan Mukta does not have a body, as consciousness, 'it' is pervaded  
everywhere and everything. No one has body. since it is projection of mind, it  
exists as sanke in rope.   
In the end, you speak from your perception and I speak from my perception.   
There is no your perception and my perception. You are talking to yourself and  
I am talking to myself. There is no You and I.   
Perception exists only for the mind. Perception is again just a projection. as  
long as the Mind exists, perception, projection, etc.. continues. When, Mano  
Naasam, all is naught.   
The games of your perception, my perception etc.. continue for the mind, is it  
not the projection of the mind?   
Quote  
we can only speak from our standpoint. A Jeevan muktha has body and a Videha  
muktha has no body.  
That everything is only the projection of the mind including the Jivanmukta  
and Videhamukta. When Mano Naasam, there is no Jivanmukta, no Videhamukta, No  
consciousness, no nothing or there is Jivanmukta, there is Videhamukta,  
Consciousness everywhere, Aatman, Brahman.   
These are all again the projections of mind.   
This mind as to merge. this is Mano naasam. As long as there are projections  
of any type, mind has not merged.

there are only two possibilities: A person with merged mind said this. which

I just have to know that I am Self [mentally]. And have firm conviction.   
There it ends.   
nothing more, nothing less.   
That is why Ramakrishna says "the ego is like a burnt rope", coz it no more  
creates confusion. there is clarity. i know i am playing the role of Ravana  
but all this is mithya. This is simple.

Well said Udai garu and Subramanian garu.   
yes sir Subramanian garu, ego killing is must.   
I agree with Udai garu, Be like an actor in a movie and play your role with

Dear srkudai,   
Yes. Ego is Ravana. As SRK said that it will be a burnt-rope,   
only when it is burnt and not otherwise. When ego is burnt,   
then there is no more role playing, because one is Rama, ever   
and unchanging.   
Arunachala Siva.

Quote from: Nagaraj on June 27, 2010, 01:17:46 PM  
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
In the above quote,Mr.Nagaraj has introduced the word "Echils"-food split down  
from the mouth and i thought share some good and ad aspects of "Echil".. In  
tamil this word commonly refers to saliva which we spit..Also, any food left  
over in the plate by the eater is also called "Echils" and is considered  
impure and and unhygienic for others to eat. The people who eat left over  
food(Echils)are looked down in society and also sometimes ridiculed..However,  
it is a a common sight in marriages that the food left over on the plate  
will be thrown in dust bin and will be collected by poorest of poor  
especially gypsies(Narikoravas) to satisfy their hunger.Also the left over  
food thrown in dust bin will be shared by dogs and other animals who are not  
fortunate as us.. In the orthodox brahmin families it is still a practice  
wherein the husband will eat first and the plate will not be washed and will  
have some left over food and in the same plate wife will be served food and  
here the "Echils" is very much nourished by the wife taken as prasad from  
husband and that "Echil" is not considered as unhygienic..However the same  
parent will not approve their children sharing "Echils".During Bhagavan days,  
some of orthodox devotees will wait till Bhagavan finishes eating and when he  
leaves dining hall, they will rush to collect the "Echil"(food left in  
hagavan's plate) and eat it as Bhagavan's prasad. When Bhagavan came to know  
of this practice, he did not approve of this.There was a well known saint by  
name Poondi Swamiyar wherein devotees will eat the food tasted by Poondi  
Swamiar and here "Echil" was very considered as divine and was very much  
respected.In swami suddhananda's ashram, Swami used to advice devotees in  
dining hall to leave some food("Echils") in plate for the animals in the  
ashram.   
During last days of Sri.Ramakrishna Paramahamsha, he was suffering with  
Cancer which was in advanced state.His closest aides who were were serving him  
were afraid to go near him fearing that they will also contract cancer and  
left him.On seeing this, Swami Vivekananda took a glass of liquid and gave it  
to Sri ramakrishna to drink and then Swami Vivekananda drank the left  
over(Echil) in the glass.On seeing this, Sri Ramakrishna's close aides got  
over the fear of Contracting Cancer and started serving him again.

Appearances are only projection of the mind, similarly, Ravana is a character  
projected by the mind. When the mind is merged into itself - Self, Ravana  
ceases to be, as there will be no mind for projection of Ravana.   
You have to remain as Rama (actually not even reamaing, you are 'that' Tat  
Tvam Asi), There is no way you can continue playing the role of Ravana, that  
implies that mind is still there.   
Once the mind is merged into Self, there will/should not be any appearances,  
i.e. no more any projections. There will only be Rama and Rama everywhere. No  
more roles, characters, etc...   
If it is so, that the Ravana role continues, and even if that role does not  
affect us as Rama, then still it is only projection of the Mind. Therefore  
Mind has still not merged.   
After enlightenment, realising that the cinema is not real, why do you still  
want to sit and watch the movie that is not there? movie still being continued  
- do you not think that still mind is there projecting the universe?   
Mind has to merge, this is Mano Naasam! which is - absolutely no projections  
at all and no continuing of movies or characters or is it even the  
enlightenment that the roles can continue and that it cannot affect you  
anymore.   
These are my humble views   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
 When there is no projection what so ever, its release from body as well. coz body too is a projection.   
as long as there is functioning, there is mind and there are projections. the  
projections continue as per prarabdha   
and then the person ends. along with all projections.   
Love!

A Jeevan Muktha is said to have had release from body and still exist in the  
body for **outsiders** like ourselves. It is Videha muktha what you are  
talking about.   
In Sadashiva Brahmendral, we have seen how his hands were chopped off and yet  
he continued to walk without even being aware of it. We all know how Ramana  
Maharshi had his tumor operated without even taking anesthesia.   
It only appears for outsiders like ourselves that a Jivanmukta has prarabdha,  
that they have body, etc.., but they do not have any prarabdha or body.

videha muktha is released from body. jeevan mukha has body.   
The jnani who said "I do not have body" is also appears to others only.   
When a person is in the influence of drugs u can try cutting off their body  
parts and they may move unconcerned.   
all these have happened in your view. in your peception.   
so lets speak from your perception.   
Does the jnani say u have a body? he says u too do not have a body. infact he  
says there is no u!   
and yet he is speaking. if u ask, the reply is "in ur view i am speaking to  
u".   
then how come u say a jeevan muktha has no body? No one has a body that way.   
so there is no projection even now!   
but u speak of ending a projection! which means u have already assumed there  
is a projection.   
if there is a projection, that is in ur view. then that projection ends after  
videha mukti. .. that too in your view.   
we can only speak from our standpoint. A Jeevan muktha has body and a Videha  
muktha has no body.

Dear I,   
Every thing that is being discussed is only a 'stand point' of view, which is  
only the mind's. It can never know the consciousness which is unlimited.  
whatever we try and say is only making it limited.   
A Jivan Mukta does not have a body, as consciousness, 'it' is pervaded  
everywhere and everything. No one has body. since it is projection of mind, it  
exists as sanke in rope.   
In the end, you speak from your perception and I speak from my perception.   
There is no your perception and my perception. You are talking to yourself and  
I am talking to myself. There is no You and I.   
Perception exists only for the mind. Perception is again just a projection. as  
long as the Mind exists, perception, projection, etc.. continues. When, Mano  
Naasam, all is naught.   
The games of your perception, my perception etc.. continue for the mind, is it  
not the projection of the mind?   
Quote  
we can only speak from our standpoint. A Jeevan muktha has body and a Videha  
muktha has no body.  
That everything is only the projection of the mind including the Jivanmukta  
and Videhamukta. When Mano Naasam, there is no Jivanmukta, no Videhamukta, No  
consciousness, no nothing or there is Jivanmukta, there is Videhamukta,  
Consciousness everywhere, Aatman, Brahman.   
These are all again the projections of mind.   
This mind as to merge. this is Mano naasam. As long as there are projections  
of any type, mind has not merged.

there are only two possibilities: A person with merged mind said this. which  
is not possible. coz for him all projections ceased.   
a person whose mind is not merged is saying what will happen when mind merges.  
in this case, how does he know?

Dear prasanth and others,   
The problem is that we are not able to visualize a state where the   
mind is killed. Mind-killing seems to be bothering most of us.   
If you substitute ego with mind, then, we are comfortable. Everyone   
agrees that one should kill the ego. Bhagavan Ramana also concludes   
ULLadu Narpadu by saying, Ahandhai uru azhitale mukti. The destruction of the  
ego is liberation. But Bhagavan Ramana uses   
the phrase mano-nasam in Who am I? He does not say Ahandai nasam. For that  
matter, He never uses the word Ahandai, ego   
in Who am I? directly. This is a poser for all of us! However, He gives one  
description about ahandai or ahankaram in Who am I? He says that "I-thought  
is the first thought from the mind. And this ahankaram."   
Arunachala Siva.

Yes . There is no movie at all. But that does not mean the appearance has to  
change.   
These words are not there... whether u see them or not   
Quote  
Where appearances still are, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.   
Ramana was seeing all this. But not "inquiring". He was Just Being.   
For one who falls into the thoughts, who is thinking he is the doer. ..  
"inquire" is suggested.   
so, inquiry is not as long as the world appears. it is as long as one is  
thinks one is not the Self: Just Be.   
Ramana saw all this. Everything.

intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
In the above quote,Mr.Nagaraj has introduced the word "Echils"-food split down  
from the mouth and i thought share some good and ad aspects of "Echil".. In  
tamil this word commonly refers to saliva which we spit..Also, any food left  
over in the plate by the eater is also called "Echils" and is considered  
impure and and unhygienic for others to eat. The people who eat left over  
food(Echils)are looked down in society and also sometimes ridiculed..However,  
it is a a common sight in marriages that the food left over on the plate  
will be thrown in dust bin and will be collected by poorest of poor  
especially gypsies(Narikoravas) to satisfy their hunger.Also the left over  
food thrown in dust bin will be shared by dogs and other animals who are not  
fortunate as us.. In the orthodox brahmin families it is still a practice  
wherein the husband will eat first and the plate will not be washed and will  
have some left over food and in the same plate wife will be served food and  
here the "Echils" is very much nourished by the wife taken as prasad from  
husband and that "Echil" is not considered as unhygienic..However the same  
parent will not approve their children sharing "Echils".During Bhagavan days,  
some of orthodox devotees will wait till Bhagavan finishes eating and when he  
leaves dining hall, they will rush to collect the "Echil"(food left in  
hagavan's plate) and eat it as Bhagavan's prasad. When Bhagavan came to know  
of this practice, he did not approve of this.There was a well known saint by  
name Poondi Swamiyar wherein devotees will eat the food tasted by Poondi  
Swamiar and here "Echil" was very considered as divine and was very much  
respected.In swami suddhananda's ashram, Swami used to advice devotees in  
dining hall to leave some food("Echils") in plate for the animals in the  
ashram.   
During last days of Sri.Ramakrishna Paramahamsha, he was suffering with  
Cancer which was in advanced state.His closest aides who were were serving him  
were afraid to go near him fearing that they will also contract cancer and  
left him.On seeing this, Swami Vivekananda took a glass of liquid and gave it  
to Sri ramakrishna to drink and then Swami Vivekananda drank the left  
over(Echil) in the glass.On seeing this, Sri Ramakrishna's close aides got  
over the fear of Contracting Cancer and started serving him again.

Dear I   
Quote from: srkudai on June 29, 2010, 07:54:26 AM  
When ego is burnt, still there is role playing, but one knows clearly that one  
is not ravana.   
why should an enlightened person not continue playing the role of Ravana,  
knowing pretty well that there is only Rama?   
Appearances are only projection of the mind, similarly, Ravana is a character  
projected by the mind. When the mind is merged into itself - Self, Ravana  
ceases to be, as there will be no mind for projection of Ravana.   
You have to remain as Rama (actually not even reamaing, you are 'that' Tat  
Tvam Asi), There is no way you can continue playing the role of Ravana, that  
implies that mind is still there.   
Once the mind is merged into Self, there will/should not be any appearances,  
i.e. no more any projections. There will only be Rama and Rama everywhere. No  
more roles, characters, etc...   
If it is so, that the Ravana role continues, and even if that role does not  
affect us as Rama, then still it is only projection of the Mind. Therefore  
Mind has still not merged.   
After enlightenment, realising that the cinema is not real, why do you still  
want to sit and watch the movie that is not there? movie still being continued  
- do you not think that still mind is there projecting the universe?   
Mind has to merge, this is Mano Naasam! which is - absolutely no projections  
at all and no continuing of movies or characters or is it even the  
enlightenment that the roles can continue and that it cannot affect you  
anymore.   
These are my humble views   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
 When there is no projection what so ever, its release from body as well. coz body too is a projection.   
as long as there is functioning, there is mind and there are projections. the  
projections continue as per prarabdha   
and then the person ends. along with all projections.   
Love!

A Jeevan Muktha is said to have had release from body and still exist in the  
body for **outsiders** like ourselves. It is Videha muktha what you are  
talking about.   
In Sadashiva Brahmendral, we have seen how his hands were chopped off and yet  
he continued to walk without even being aware of it. We all know how Ramana  
Maharshi had his tumor operated without even taking anesthesia.   
It only appears for outsiders like ourselves that a Jivanmukta has prarabdha,  
that they have body, etc.., but they do not have any prarabdha or body.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

videha muktha is released from body. jeevan mukha has body.   
The jnani who said "I do not have body" is also appears to others only.   
When a person is in the influence of drugs u can try cutting off their body  
parts and they may move unconcerned.   
all these have happened in your view. in your peception.   
so lets speak from your perception.   
Does the jnani say u have a body? he says u too do not have a body. infact he  
says there is no u!   
and yet he is speaking. if u ask, the reply is "in ur view i am speaking to  
u".   
then how come u say a jeevan muktha has no body? No one has a body that way.   
so there is no projection even now!   
but u speak of ending a projection! which means u have already assumed there  
is a projection.   
if there is a projection, that is in ur view. then that projection ends after  
videha mukti. .. that too in your view.   
we can only speak from our standpoint. A Jeevan muktha has body and a Videha  
muktha has no body.

Dear I,   
Every thing that is being discussed is only a 'stand point' of view, which is  
only the mind's. It can never know the consciousness which is unlimited.  
whatever we try and say is only making it limited.   
A Jivan Mukta does not have a body, as consciousness, 'it' is pervaded  
everywhere and everything. No one has body. since it is projection of mind, it  
exists as sanke in rope.   
In the end, you speak from your perception and I speak from my perception.   
There is no your perception and my perception. You are talking to yourself and  
I am talking to myself. There is no You and I.   
Perception exists only for the mind. Perception is again just a projection. as  
long as the Mind exists, perception, projection, etc.. continues. When, Mano  
Naasam, all is naught.   
The games of your perception, my perception etc.. continue for the mind, is it  
not the projection of the mind?   
Quote  
we can only speak from our standpoint. A Jeevan muktha has body and a Videha  
muktha has no body.  
That everything is only the projection of the mind including the Jivanmukta  
and Videhamukta. When Mano Naasam, there is no Jivanmukta, no Videhamukta, No  
consciousness, no nothing or there is Jivanmukta, there is Videhamukta,  
Consciousness everywhere, Aatman, Brahman.   
These are all again the projections of mind.   
This mind as to merge. this is Mano naasam. As long as there are projections  
of any type, mind has not merged.

there are only two possibilities: A person with merged mind said this. which  
is not possible. coz for him all projections ceased.   
a person whose mind is not merged is saying what will happen when mind merges.  
in this case, how does he know?   
both cases are meaningless.   
simple point... merging of mind is not absence of projection. its just veiling  
power that is eliminated.   
final merging or elimination of projection is videha mukti. not jeevan mukthi.

Dear prasanth and others,   
The problem is that we are not able to visualize a state where the   
mind is killed. Mind-killing seems to be bothering most of us.   
If you substitute ego with mind, then, we are comfortable. Everyone   
agrees that one should kill the ego. Bhagavan Ramana also concludes   
ULLadu Narpadu by saying, Ahandhai uru azhitale mukti. The destruction of the  
ego is liberation. But Bhagavan Ramana uses   
the phrase mano-nasam in Who am I? He does not say Ahandai nasam. For that  
matter, He never uses the word Ahandai, ego   
in Who am I? directly. This is a poser for all of us! However, He gives one  
description about ahandai or ahankaram in Who am I? He says that "I-thought  
is the first thought from the mind. And this ahankaram."   
Arunachala Siva.

Yes . There is no movie at all. But that does not mean the appearance has to  
change.   
These words are not there... whether u see them or not   
Quote  
Where appearances still are, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.   
Ramana was seeing all this. But not "inquiring". He was Just Being.   
For one who falls into the thoughts, who is thinking he is the doer. ..  
"inquire" is suggested.   
so, inquiry is not as long as the world appears. it is as long as one is  
thinks one is not the Self: Just Be.   
Ramana saw all this. Everything.

Dear Subramanian,   
Suppose i am playing the role of Ravana and take myself to be Ravana. I am  
Ravana is ego. I am Self is Truth.   
I am Ravana. .. as a Role.   
I am Self. .. As the Ultimate.   
The Role of Ravana need not be destroyed. If I do not know i am Ravana, i  
cannot play that role.   
I just have to know that I am Self [mentally]. And have firm conviction.   
There it ends.   
nothing more, nothing less.   
That is why Ramakrishna says "the ego is like a burnt rope", coz it no more  
creates confusion. there is clarity. i know i am playing the role of Ravana  
but all this is mithya. This is simple.   
Love!

is not ravana.   
why should an enlightened person not continue playing the role of Ravana,  
knowing pretty well that there is only Rama?   
Appearances are only projection of the mind, similarly, Ravana is a character  
projected by the mind. When the mind is merged into itself - Self, Ravana  
ceases to be, as there will be no mind for projection of Ravana.   
You have to remain as Rama (actually not even reamaing, you are 'that' Tat  
Tvam Asi), There is no way you can continue playing the role of Ravana, that  
implies that mind is still there.   
Once the mind is merged into Self, there will/should not be any appearances,  
i.e. no more any projections. There will only be Rama and Rama everywhere. No  
more roles, characters, etc...   
If it is so, that the Ravana role continues, and even if that role does not  
affect us as Rama, then still it is only projection of the Mind. Therefore  
Mind has still not merged.   
After enlightenment, realising that the cinema is not real, why do you still  
want to sit and watch the movie that is not there? movie still being continued  
- do you not think that still mind is there projecting the universe?   
Mind has to merge, this is Mano Naasam! which is - absolutely no projections  
at all and no continuing of movies or characters or is it even the  
enlightenment that the roles can continue and that it cannot affect you  
anymore.   
These are my humble views

Dear Nagaraj,   
 When there is no projection what so ever, its release from body as well. coz body too is a projection.   
as long as there is functioning, there is mind and there are projections. the  
projections continue as per prarabdha   
and then the person ends. along with all projections.   
Love!

A Jeevan Muktha is said to have had release from body and still exist in the  
body for **outsiders** like ourselves. It is Videha muktha what you are  
talking about.   
In Sadashiva Brahmendral, we have seen how his hands were chopped off and yet  
he continued to walk without even being aware of it. We all know how Ramana  
Maharshi had his tumor operated without even taking anesthesia.   
It only appears for outsiders like ourselves that a Jivanmukta has prarabdha,  
that they have body, etc.., but they do not have any prarabdha or body.

videha muktha is released from body. jeevan mukha has body.   
The jnani who said "I do not have body" is also appears to others only.   
When a person is in the influence of drugs u can try cutting off their body  
parts and they may move unconcerned.   
all these have happened in your view. in your peception.   
so lets speak from your perception.   
Does the jnani say u have a body? he says u too do not have a body. infact he  
says there is no u!   
and yet he is speaking. if u ask, the reply is "in ur view i am speaking to  
u".   
then how come u say a jeevan muktha has no body? No one has a body that way.   
so there is no projection even now!   
but u speak of ending a projection! which means u have already assumed there  
is a projection.   
if there is a projection, that is in ur view. then that projection ends after  
videha mukti. .. that too in your view.   
we can only speak from our standpoint. A Jeevan muktha has body and a Videha  
muktha has no body.

Dear I,   
Every thing that is being discussed is only a 'stand point' of view, which is  
only the mind's. It can never know the consciousness which is unlimited.  
whatever we try and say is only making it limited.   
A Jivan Mukta does not have a body, as consciousness, 'it' is pervaded  
everywhere and everything. No one has body. since it is projection of mind, it  
exists as sanke in rope.   
In the end, you speak from your perception and I speak from my perception.   
There is no your perception and my perception. You are talking to yourself and  
I am talking to myself. There is no You and I.   
Perception exists only for the mind. Perception is again just a projection. as  
long as the Mind exists, perception, projection, etc.. continues. When, Mano  
Naasam, all is naught.   
The games of your perception, my perception etc.. continue for the mind, is it  
not the projection of the mind?   
Quote  
we can only speak from our standpoint. A Jeevan muktha has body and a Videha  
muktha has no body.  
That everything is only the projection of the mind including the Jivanmukta  
and Videhamukta. When Mano Naasam, there is no Jivanmukta, no Videhamukta, No  
consciousness, no nothing or there is Jivanmukta, there is Videhamukta,  
Consciousness everywhere, Aatman, Brahman.   
These are all again the projections of mind.   
This mind as to merge. this is Mano naasam. As long as there are projections  
of any type, mind has not merged.

there are only two possibilities: A person with merged mind said this. which  
is not possible. coz for him all projections ceased.   
a person whose mind is not merged is saying what will happen when mind merges.  
in this case, how does he know?   
both cases are meaningless.   
simple point... merging of mind is not absence of projection. its just veiling  
power that is eliminated.   
final merging or elimination of projection is videha mukti. not jeevan mukthi.

Dear prasanth and others,   
The problem is that we are not able to visualize a state where the   
mind is killed. Mind-killing seems to be bothering most of us.   
If you substitute ego with mind, then, we are comfortable. Everyone   
agrees that one should kill the ego. Bhagavan Ramana also concludes   
ULLadu Narpadu by saying, Ahandhai uru azhitale mukti. The destruction of the  
ego is liberation. But Bhagavan Ramana uses   
the phrase mano-nasam in Who am I? He does not say Ahandai nasam. For that  
matter, He never uses the word Ahandai, ego   
in Who am I? directly. This is a poser for all of us! However, He gives one  
description about ahandai or ahankaram in Who am I? He says that "I-thought  
is the first thought from the mind. And this ahankaram."   
Arunachala Siva.

Yes . There is no movie at all. But that does not mean the appearance has to  
change.   
These words are not there... whether u see them or not   
Quote  
Where appearances still are, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.   
Ramana was seeing all this. But not "inquiring". He was Just Being.   
For one who falls into the thoughts, who is thinking he is the doer. ..  
"inquire" is suggested.   
so, inquiry is not as long as the world appears. it is as long as one is  
thinks one is not the Self: Just Be.   
Ramana saw all this. Everything.

Dear Subramanian,   
Suppose i am playing the role of Ravana and take myself to be Ravana. I am  
Ravana is ego. I am Self is Truth.   
I am Ravana. .. as a Role.   
I am Self. .. As the Ultimate.   
The Role of Ravana need not be destroyed. If I do not know i am Ravana, i  
cannot play that role.   
I just have to know that I am Self [mentally]. And have firm conviction.   
There it ends.   
nothing more, nothing less.   
That is why Ramakrishna says "the ego is like a burnt rope", coz it no more  
creates confusion. there is clarity. i know i am playing the role of Ravana  
but all this is mithya. This is simple.   
Love!

Quote from: Nagaraj on June 27, 2010, 01:17:46 PM  
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
In the above quote,Mr.Nagaraj has introduced the word "Echils"-food split down  
from the mouth and i thought share some good and ad aspects of "Echil".. In  
tamil this word commonly refers to saliva which we spit..Also, any food left  
over in the plate by the eater is also called "Echils" and is considered  
impure and and unhygienic for others to eat. The people who eat left over  
food(Echils)are looked down in society and also sometimes ridiculed..However,  
it is a a common sight in marriages that the food left over on the plate  
will be thrown in dust bin and will be collected by poorest of poor  
especially gypsies(Narikoravas) to satisfy their hunger.Also the left over  
food thrown in dust bin will be shared by dogs and other animals who are not  
fortunate as us.. In the orthodox brahmin families it is still a practice  
wherein the husband will eat first and the plate will not be washed and will  
have some left over food and in the same plate wife will be served food and  
here the "Echils" is very much nourished by the wife taken as prasad from  
husband and that "Echil" is not considered as unhygienic..However the same  
parent will not approve their children sharing "Echils".During Bhagavan days,  
some of orthodox devotees will wait till Bhagavan finishes eating and when he  
leaves dining hall, they will rush to collect the "Echil"(food left in  
hagavan's plate) and eat it as Bhagavan's prasad. When Bhagavan came to know  
of this practice, he did not approve of this.There was a well known saint by  
name Poondi Swamiyar wherein devotees will eat the food tasted by Poondi  
Swamiar and here "Echil" was very considered as divine and was very much  
respected.In swami suddhananda's ashram, Swami used to advice devotees in  
dining hall to leave some food("Echils") in plate for the animals in the  
ashram.   
During last days of Sri.Ramakrishna Paramahamsha, he was suffering with  
Cancer which was in advanced state.His closest aides who were were serving him  
were afraid to go near him fearing that they will also contract cancer and  
left him.On seeing this, Swami Vivekananda took a glass of liquid and gave it  
to Sri ramakrishna to drink and then Swami Vivekananda drank the left  
over(Echil) in the glass.On seeing this, Sri Ramakrishna's close aides got  
over the fear of Contracting Cancer and started serving him again.

Appearances are only projection of the mind, similarly, Ravana is a character

If it is so, that the Ravana role continues, and even if that role does not  
affect us as Rama, then still it is only projection of the Mind. Therefore  
Mind has still not merged.   
After enlightenment, realising that the cinema is not real, why do you still  
want to sit and watch the movie that is not there? movie still being continued  
- do you not think that still mind is there projecting the universe?   
Mind has to merge, this is Mano Naasam! which is - absolutely no projections  
at all and no continuing of movies or characters or is it even the  
enlightenment that the roles can continue and that it cannot affect you  
anymore.

videha muktha is released from body. jeevan mukha has body.   
The jnani who said "I do not have body" is also appears to others only.   
When a person is in the influence of drugs u can try cutting off their body  
parts and they may move unconcerned.   
all these have happened in your view. in your peception.   
so lets speak from your perception.   
Does the jnani say u have a body? he says u too do not have a body. infact he  
says there is no u!   
and yet he is speaking. if u ask, the reply is "in ur view i am speaking to  
u".   
then how come u say a jeevan muktha has no body? No one has a body that way.   
so there is no projection even now!   
but u speak of ending a projection! which means u have already assumed there  
is a projection.   
if there is a projection, that is in ur view. then that projection ends after  
videha mukti. .. that too in your view.   
we can only speak from our standpoint. A Jeevan muktha has body and a Videha  
muktha has no body.

Dear I,   
Every thing that is being discussed is only a 'stand point' of view, which is  
only the mind's. It can never know the consciousness which is unlimited.  
whatever we try and say is only making it limited.   
A Jivan Mukta does not have a body, as consciousness, 'it' is pervaded  
everywhere and everything. No one has body. since it is projection of mind, it  
exists as sanke in rope.   
In the end, you speak from your perception and I speak from my perception.   
There is no your perception and my perception. You are talking to yourself and  
I am talking to myself. There is no You and I.   
Perception exists only for the mind. Perception is again just a projection. as  
long as the Mind exists, perception, projection, etc.. continues. When, Mano  
Naasam, all is naught.   
The games of your perception, my perception etc.. continue for the mind, is it  
not the projection of the mind?   
Quote  
we can only speak from our standpoint. A Jeevan muktha has body and a Videha  
muktha has no body.  
That everything is only the projection of the mind including the Jivanmukta  
and Videhamukta. When Mano Naasam, there is no Jivanmukta, no Videhamukta, No  
consciousness, no nothing or there is Jivanmukta, there is Videhamukta,  
Consciousness everywhere, Aatman, Brahman.   
These are all again the projections of mind.   
This mind as to merge. this is Mano naasam. As long as there are projections  
of any type, mind has not merged.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

there are only two possibilities: A person with merged mind said this. which  
is not possible. coz for him all projections ceased.   
a person whose mind is not merged is saying what will happen when mind merges.  
in this case, how does he know?   
both cases are meaningless.   
simple point... merging of mind is not absence of projection. its just veiling  
power that is eliminated.   
final merging or elimination of projection is videha mukti. not jeevan mukthi.

Dear prasanth and others,   
The problem is that we are not able to visualize a state where the   
mind is killed. Mind-killing seems to be bothering most of us.   
If you substitute ego with mind, then, we are comfortable. Everyone   
agrees that one should kill the ego. Bhagavan Ramana also concludes   
ULLadu Narpadu by saying, Ahandhai uru azhitale mukti. The destruction of the  
ego is liberation. But Bhagavan Ramana uses   
the phrase mano-nasam in Who am I? He does not say Ahandai nasam. For that  
matter, He never uses the word Ahandai, ego   
in Who am I? directly. This is a poser for all of us! However, He gives one  
description about ahandai or ahankaram in Who am I? He says that "I-thought  
is the first thought from the mind. And this ahankaram."   
Arunachala Siva.

Yes . There is no movie at all. But that does not mean the appearance has to  
change.   
These words are not there... whether u see them or not   
Quote  
Where appearances still are, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.   
Ramana was seeing all this. But not "inquiring". He was Just Being.   
For one who falls into the thoughts, who is thinking he is the doer. ..  
"inquire" is suggested.   
so, inquiry is not as long as the world appears. it is as long as one is  
thinks one is not the Self: Just Be.   
Ramana saw all this. Everything.

Dear Subramanian,   
Suppose i am playing the role of Ravana and take myself to be Ravana. I am  
Ravana is ego. I am Self is Truth.   
I am Ravana. .. as a Role.   
I am Self. .. As the Ultimate.   
The Role of Ravana need not be destroyed. If I do not know i am Ravana, i  
cannot play that role.   
I just have to know that I am Self [mentally]. And have firm conviction.   
There it ends.   
nothing more, nothing less.   
That is why Ramakrishna says "the ego is like a burnt rope", coz it no more  
creates confusion. there is clarity. i know i am playing the role of Ravana  
but all this is mithya. This is simple.   
Love!

Yes. Ego is Ravana. As SRK said that it will be a burnt-rope,   
only when it is burnt and not otherwise. When ego is burnt,   
then there is no more role playing, because one is Rama, ever   
and unchanging.

Quote from: Nagaraj on June 27, 2010, 01:17:46 PM  
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
In the above quote,Mr.Nagaraj has introduced the word "Echils"-food split down  
from the mouth and i thought share some good and ad aspects of "Echil".. In  
tamil this word commonly refers to saliva which we spit..Also, any food left  
over in the plate by the eater is also called "Echils" and is considered  
impure and and unhygienic for others to eat. The people who eat left over  
food(Echils)are looked down in society and also sometimes ridiculed..However,  
it is a a common sight in marriages that the food left over on the plate  
will be thrown in dust bin and will be collected by poorest of poor  
especially gypsies(Narikoravas) to satisfy their hunger.Also the left over  
food thrown in dust bin will be shared by dogs and other animals who are not  
fortunate as us.. In the orthodox brahmin families it is still a practice  
wherein the husband will eat first and the plate will not be washed and will  
have some left over food and in the same plate wife will be served food and  
here the "Echils" is very much nourished by the wife taken as prasad from  
husband and that "Echil" is not considered as unhygienic..However the same  
parent will not approve their children sharing "Echils".During Bhagavan days,  
some of orthodox devotees will wait till Bhagavan finishes eating and when he  
leaves dining hall, they will rush to collect the "Echil"(food left in  
hagavan's plate) and eat it as Bhagavan's prasad. When Bhagavan came to know  
of this practice, he did not approve of this.There was a well known saint by  
name Poondi Swamiyar wherein devotees will eat the food tasted by Poondi  
Swamiar and here "Echil" was very considered as divine and was very much  
respected.In swami suddhananda's ashram, Swami used to advice devotees in  
dining hall to leave some food("Echils") in plate for the animals in the  
ashram.   
During last days of Sri.Ramakrishna Paramahamsha, he was suffering with  
Cancer which was in advanced state.His closest aides who were were serving him  
were afraid to go near him fearing that they will also contract cancer and  
left him.On seeing this, Swami Vivekananda took a glass of liquid and gave it  
to Sri ramakrishna to drink and then Swami Vivekananda drank the left  
over(Echil) in the glass.On seeing this, Sri Ramakrishna's close aides got  
over the fear of Contracting Cancer and started serving him again.

Quote from: srkudai on June 29, 2010, 07:54:26 AM

why should an enlightened person not continue playing the role of Ravana,

Appearances are only projection of the mind, similarly, Ravana is a character  
projected by the mind. When the mind is merged into itself - Self, Ravana  
ceases to be, as there will be no mind for projection of Ravana.   
You have to remain as Rama (actually not even reamaing, you are 'that' Tat  
Tvam Asi), There is no way you can continue playing the role of Ravana, that  
implies that mind is still there.   
Once the mind is merged into Self, there will/should not be any appearances,  
i.e. no more any projections. There will only be Rama and Rama everywhere. No  
more roles, characters, etc...   
If it is so, that the Ravana role continues, and even if that role does not  
affect us as Rama, then still it is only projection of the Mind. Therefore  
Mind has still not merged.   
After enlightenment, realising that the cinema is not real, why do you still  
want to sit and watch the movie that is not there? movie still being continued  
- do you not think that still mind is there projecting the universe?   
Mind has to merge, this is Mano Naasam! which is - absolutely no projections  
at all and no continuing of movies or characters or is it even the  
enlightenment that the roles can continue and that it cannot affect you  
anymore.   
These are my humble views

Dear Nagaraj,   
 When there is no projection what so ever, its release from body as well. coz body too is a projection.   
as long as there is functioning, there is mind and there are projections. the  
projections continue as per prarabdha   
and then the person ends. along with all projections.

A Jeevan Muktha is said to have had release from body and still exist in the  
body for **outsiders** like ourselves. It is Videha muktha what you are  
talking about.   
In Sadashiva Brahmendral, we have seen how his hands were chopped off and yet  
he continued to walk without even being aware of it. We all know how Ramana  
Maharshi had his tumor operated without even taking anesthesia.   
It only appears for outsiders like ourselves that a Jivanmukta has prarabdha,  
that they have body, etc.., but they do not have any prarabdha or body.

there are only two possibilities: A person with merged mind said this. which  
is not possible. coz for him all projections ceased.   
a person whose mind is not merged is saying what will happen when mind merges.  
in this case, how does he know?   
both cases are meaningless.   
simple point... merging of mind is not absence of projection. its just veiling  
power that is eliminated.   
final merging or elimination of projection is videha mukti. not jeevan mukthi.

Dear I,   
This is your projection: Quote from: srkudai on June 30, 2010, 07:49:59 AM

and this response is my projection.   
As a whole, your projection and my projection is my projection to myself and  
similarly, As a whole, your projection and my projection is your projection to  
yourself.   
So long these projections continue, so long there is mind which is not merged.   
There is nothing more discuss or rather project from here.

Dear prasanth and others,   
The problem is that we are not able to visualize a state where the   
mind is killed. Mind-killing seems to be bothering most of us.   
If you substitute ego with mind, then, we are comfortable. Everyone   
agrees that one should kill the ego. Bhagavan Ramana also concludes   
ULLadu Narpadu by saying, Ahandhai uru azhitale mukti. The destruction of the  
ego is liberation. But Bhagavan Ramana uses   
the phrase mano-nasam in Who am I? He does not say Ahandai nasam. For that  
matter, He never uses the word Ahandai, ego   
in Who am I? directly. This is a poser for all of us! However, He gives one  
description about ahandai or ahankaram in Who am I? He says that "I-thought  
is the first thought from the mind. And this ahankaram."   
Arunachala Siva.

Yes . There is no movie at all. But that does not mean the appearance has to  
change.   
These words are not there... whether u see them or not   
Quote  
Where appearances still are, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.   
Ramana was seeing all this. But not "inquiring". He was Just Being.   
For one who falls into the thoughts, who is thinking he is the doer. ..  
"inquire" is suggested.   
so, inquiry is not as long as the world appears. it is as long as one is  
thinks one is not the Self: Just Be.   
Ramana saw all this. Everything.

Dear Subramanian,   
Suppose i am playing the role of Ravana and take myself to be Ravana. I am  
Ravana is ego. I am Self is Truth.   
I am Ravana. .. as a Role.   
I am Self. .. As the Ultimate.   
The Role of Ravana need not be destroyed. If I do not know i am Ravana, i  
cannot play that role.   
I just have to know that I am Self [mentally]. And have firm conviction.   
There it ends.   
nothing more, nothing less.   
That is why Ramakrishna says "the ego is like a burnt rope", coz it no more  
creates confusion. there is clarity. i know i am playing the role of Ravana  
but all this is mithya. This is simple.   
Love!

Dear srkudai,   
Yes. Ego is Ravana. As SRK said that it will be a burnt-rope,   
only when it is burnt and not otherwise. When ego is burnt,   
then there is no more role playing, because one is Rama, ever   
and unchanging.

When ego is burnt, still there is role playing, but one knows clearly that one  
is not ravana.   
why should an enlightened person not continue playing the role of Ravana,

Quote from: Nagaraj on June 27, 2010, 01:17:46 PM  
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
In the above quote,Mr.Nagaraj has introduced the word "Echils"-food split down  
from the mouth and i thought share some good and ad aspects of "Echil".. In  
tamil this word commonly refers to saliva which we spit..Also, any food left  
over in the plate by the eater is also called "Echils" and is considered  
impure and and unhygienic for others to eat. The people who eat left over  
food(Echils)are looked down in society and also sometimes ridiculed..However,  
it is a a common sight in marriages that the food left over on the plate  
will be thrown in dust bin and will be collected by poorest of poor  
especially gypsies(Narikoravas) to satisfy their hunger.Also the left over  
food thrown in dust bin will be shared by dogs and other animals who are not  
fortunate as us.. In the orthodox brahmin families it is still a practice  
wherein the husband will eat first and the plate will not be washed and will  
have some left over food and in the same plate wife will be served food and  
here the "Echils" is very much nourished by the wife taken as prasad from  
husband and that "Echil" is not considered as unhygienic..However the same  
parent will not approve their children sharing "Echils".During Bhagavan days,  
some of orthodox devotees will wait till Bhagavan finishes eating and when he  
leaves dining hall, they will rush to collect the "Echil"(food left in  
hagavan's plate) and eat it as Bhagavan's prasad. When Bhagavan came to know  
of this practice, he did not approve of this.There was a well known saint by  
name Poondi Swamiyar wherein devotees will eat the food tasted by Poondi  
Swamiar and here "Echil" was very considered as divine and was very much  
respected.In swami suddhananda's ashram, Swami used to advice devotees in  
dining hall to leave some food("Echils") in plate for the animals in the  
ashram.   
During last days of Sri.Ramakrishna Paramahamsha, he was suffering with  
Cancer which was in advanced state.His closest aides who were were serving him  
were afraid to go near him fearing that they will also contract cancer and  
left him.On seeing this, Swami Vivekananda took a glass of liquid and gave it  
to Sri ramakrishna to drink and then Swami Vivekananda drank the left  
over(Echil) in the glass.On seeing this, Sri Ramakrishna's close aides got  
over the fear of Contracting Cancer and started serving him again.

Quote from: srkudai on June 29, 2010, 07:54:26 AM

why should an enlightened person not continue playing the role of Ravana,

Appearances are only projection of the mind, similarly, Ravana is a character  
projected by the mind. When the mind is merged into itself - Self, Ravana  
ceases to be, as there will be no mind for projection of Ravana.   
You have to remain as Rama (actually not even reamaing, you are 'that' Tat  
Tvam Asi), There is no way you can continue playing the role of Ravana, that  
implies that mind is still there.   
Once the mind is merged into Self, there will/should not be any appearances,  
i.e. no more any projections. There will only be Rama and Rama everywhere. No  
more roles, characters, etc...   
If it is so, that the Ravana role continues, and even if that role does not  
affect us as Rama, then still it is only projection of the Mind. Therefore  
Mind has still not merged.   
After enlightenment, realising that the cinema is not real, why do you still  
want to sit and watch the movie that is not there? movie still being continued  
- do you not think that still mind is there projecting the universe?   
Mind has to merge, this is Mano Naasam! which is - absolutely no projections  
at all and no continuing of movies or characters or is it even the  
enlightenment that the roles can continue and that it cannot affect you  
anymore.   
These are my humble views   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
 When there is no projection what so ever, its release from body as well. coz body too is a projection.   
as long as there is functioning, there is mind and there are projections. the  
projections continue as per prarabdha   
and then the person ends. along with all projections.   
Love!

A Jeevan Muktha is said to have had release from body and still exist in the  
body for **outsiders** like ourselves. It is Videha muktha what you are  
talking about.   
In Sadashiva Brahmendral, we have seen how his hands were chopped off and yet  
he continued to walk without even being aware of it. We all know how Ramana  
Maharshi had his tumor operated without even taking anesthesia.   
It only appears for outsiders like ourselves that a Jivanmukta has prarabdha,  
that they have body, etc.., but they do not have any prarabdha or body.

videha muktha is released from body. jeevan mukha has body.   
The jnani who said "I do not have body" is also appears to others only.   
When a person is in the influence of drugs u can try cutting off their body  
parts and they may move unconcerned.   
all these have happened in your view. in your peception.   
so lets speak from your perception.   
Does the jnani say u have a body? he says u too do not have a body. infact he  
says there is no u!   
and yet he is speaking. if u ask, the reply is "in ur view i am speaking to  
u".   
then how come u say a jeevan muktha has no body? No one has a body that way.   
so there is no projection even now!   
but u speak of ending a projection! which means u have already assumed there  
is a projection.   
if there is a projection, that is in ur view. then that projection ends after  
videha mukti. .. that too in your view.   
we can only speak from our standpoint. A Jeevan muktha has body and a Videha  
muktha has no body.

Dear I,   
Every thing that is being discussed is only a 'stand point' of view, which is  
only the mind's. It can never know the consciousness which is unlimited.  
whatever we try and say is only making it limited.   
A Jivan Mukta does not have a body, as consciousness, 'it' is pervaded  
everywhere and everything. No one has body. since it is projection of mind, it  
exists as sanke in rope.   
In the end, you speak from your perception and I speak from my perception.   
There is no your perception and my perception. You are talking to yourself and  
I am talking to myself. There is no You and I.   
Perception exists only for the mind. Perception is again just a projection. as  
long as the Mind exists, perception, projection, etc.. continues. When, Mano  
Naasam, all is naught.   
The games of your perception, my perception etc.. continue for the mind, is it  
not the projection of the mind?   
Quote  
we can only speak from our standpoint. A Jeevan muktha has body and a Videha  
muktha has no body.  
That everything is only the projection of the mind including the Jivanmukta  
and Videhamukta. When Mano Naasam, there is no Jivanmukta, no Videhamukta, No  
consciousness, no nothing or there is Jivanmukta, there is Videhamukta,  
Consciousness everywhere, Aatman, Brahman.   
These are all again the projections of mind.   
This mind as to merge. this is Mano naasam. As long as there are projections  
of any type, mind has not merged.

there are only two possibilities: A person with merged mind said this. which

a person whose mind is not merged is saying what will happen when mind merges.

Yes . There is no movie at all. But that does not mean the appearance has to  
change.   
These words are not there... whether u see them or not   
Quote  
Where appearances still are, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.   
Ramana was seeing all this. But not "inquiring". He was Just Being.   
For one who falls into the thoughts, who is thinking he is the doer. ..  
"inquire" is suggested.   
so, inquiry is not as long as the world appears. it is as long as one is  
thinks one is not the Self: Just Be.   
Ramana saw all this. Everything.

Dear Subramanian,   
Suppose i am playing the role of Ravana and take myself to be Ravana. I am  
Ravana is ego. I am Self is Truth.   
I am Ravana. .. as a Role.   
I am Self. .. As the Ultimate.   
The Role of Ravana need not be destroyed. If I do not know i am Ravana, i  
cannot play that role.   
I just have to know that I am Self [mentally]. And have firm conviction.   
There it ends.   
nothing more, nothing less.   
That is why Ramakrishna says "the ego is like a burnt rope", coz it no more  
creates confusion. there is clarity. i know i am playing the role of Ravana  
but all this is mithya. This is simple.   
Love!

Dear srkudai,   
Yes. Ego is Ravana. As SRK said that it will be a burnt-rope,   
only when it is burnt and not otherwise. When ego is burnt,   
then there is no more role playing, because one is Rama, ever   
and unchanging.

why should an enlightened person not continue playing the role of Ravana,

Quote from: Nagaraj on June 27, 2010, 01:17:46 PM  
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
In the above quote,Mr.Nagaraj has introduced the word "Echils"-food split down  
from the mouth and i thought share some good and ad aspects of "Echil".. In  
tamil this word commonly refers to saliva which we spit..Also, any food left  
over in the plate by the eater is also called "Echils" and is considered  
impure and and unhygienic for others to eat. The people who eat left over  
food(Echils)are looked down in society and also sometimes ridiculed..However,  
it is a a common sight in marriages that the food left over on the plate  
will be thrown in dust bin and will be collected by poorest of poor  
especially gypsies(Narikoravas) to satisfy their hunger.Also the left over  
food thrown in dust bin will be shared by dogs and other animals who are not  
fortunate as us.. In the orthodox brahmin families it is still a practice  
wherein the husband will eat first and the plate will not be washed and will  
have some left over food and in the same plate wife will be served food and  
here the "Echils" is very much nourished by the wife taken as prasad from  
husband and that "Echil" is not considered as unhygienic..However the same  
parent will not approve their children sharing "Echils".During Bhagavan days,  
some of orthodox devotees will wait till Bhagavan finishes eating and when he  
leaves dining hall, they will rush to collect the "Echil"(food left in  
hagavan's plate) and eat it as Bhagavan's prasad. When Bhagavan came to know  
of this practice, he did not approve of this.There was a well known saint by  
name Poondi Swamiyar wherein devotees will eat the food tasted by Poondi  
Swamiar and here "Echil" was very considered as divine and was very much  
respected.In swami suddhananda's ashram, Swami used to advice devotees in  
dining hall to leave some food("Echils") in plate for the animals in the  
ashram.   
During last days of Sri.Ramakrishna Paramahamsha, he was suffering with  
Cancer which was in advanced state.His closest aides who were were serving him  
were afraid to go near him fearing that they will also contract cancer and  
left him.On seeing this, Swami Vivekananda took a glass of liquid and gave it  
to Sri ramakrishna to drink and then Swami Vivekananda drank the left  
over(Echil) in the glass.On seeing this, Sri Ramakrishna's close aides got  
over the fear of Contracting Cancer and started serving him again.

Appearances are only projection of the mind, similarly, Ravana is a character  
projected by the mind. When the mind is merged into itself - Self, Ravana  
ceases to be, as there will be no mind for projection of Ravana.   
You have to remain as Rama (actually not even reamaing, you are 'that' Tat  
Tvam Asi), There is no way you can continue playing the role of Ravana, that  
implies that mind is still there.   
Once the mind is merged into Self, there will/should not be any appearances,  
i.e. no more any projections. There will only be Rama and Rama everywhere. No  
more roles, characters, etc...   
If it is so, that the Ravana role continues, and even if that role does not  
affect us as Rama, then still it is only projection of the Mind. Therefore  
Mind has still not merged.   
After enlightenment, realising that the cinema is not real, why do you still  
want to sit and watch the movie that is not there? movie still being continued  
- do you not think that still mind is there projecting the universe?   
Mind has to merge, this is Mano Naasam! which is - absolutely no projections  
at all and no continuing of movies or characters or is it even the  
enlightenment that the roles can continue and that it cannot affect you  
anymore.   
These are my humble views   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
 When there is no projection what so ever, its release from body as well. coz body too is a projection.   
as long as there is functioning, there is mind and there are projections. the  
projections continue as per prarabdha   
and then the person ends. along with all projections.   
Love!

A Jeevan Muktha is said to have had release from body and still exist in the  
body for **outsiders** like ourselves. It is Videha muktha what you are  
talking about.   
In Sadashiva Brahmendral, we have seen how his hands were chopped off and yet  
he continued to walk without even being aware of it. We all know how Ramana  
Maharshi had his tumor operated without even taking anesthesia.   
It only appears for outsiders like ourselves that a Jivanmukta has prarabdha,  
that they have body, etc.., but they do not have any prarabdha or body.

videha muktha is released from body. jeevan mukha has body.   
The jnani who said "I do not have body" is also appears to others only.   
When a person is in the influence of drugs u can try cutting off their body  
parts and they may move unconcerned.   
all these have happened in your view. in your peception.   
so lets speak from your perception.   
Does the jnani say u have a body? he says u too do not have a body. infact he  
says there is no u!   
and yet he is speaking. if u ask, the reply is "in ur view i am speaking to  
u".   
then how come u say a jeevan muktha has no body? No one has a body that way.   
so there is no projection even now!   
but u speak of ending a projection! which means u have already assumed there  
is a projection.   
if there is a projection, that is in ur view. then that projection ends after  
videha mukti. .. that too in your view.   
we can only speak from our standpoint. A Jeevan muktha has body and a Videha  
muktha has no body.

Dear I,   
Every thing that is being discussed is only a 'stand point' of view, which is  
only the mind's. It can never know the consciousness which is unlimited.  
whatever we try and say is only making it limited.   
A Jivan Mukta does not have a body, as consciousness, 'it' is pervaded  
everywhere and everything. No one has body. since it is projection of mind, it  
exists as sanke in rope.   
In the end, you speak from your perception and I speak from my perception.   
There is no your perception and my perception. You are talking to yourself and  
I am talking to myself. There is no You and I.   
Perception exists only for the mind. Perception is again just a projection. as  
long as the Mind exists, perception, projection, etc.. continues. When, Mano  
Naasam, all is naught.   
The games of your perception, my perception etc.. continue for the mind, is it  
not the projection of the mind?   
Quote  
we can only speak from our standpoint. A Jeevan muktha has body and a Videha  
muktha has no body.  
That everything is only the projection of the mind including the Jivanmukta  
and Videhamukta. When Mano Naasam, there is no Jivanmukta, no Videhamukta, No  
consciousness, no nothing or there is Jivanmukta, there is Videhamukta,  
Consciousness everywhere, Aatman, Brahman.   
These are all again the projections of mind.   
This mind as to merge. this is Mano naasam. As long as there are projections  
of any type, mind has not merged.

there are only two possibilities: A person with merged mind said this. which

a person whose mind is not merged is saying what will happen when mind merges.  
in this case, how does he know?

Dear prasanth and others,   
The problem is that we are not able to visualize a state where the   
mind is killed. Mind-killing seems to be bothering most of us.   
If you substitute ego with mind, then, we are comfortable. Everyone   
agrees that one should kill the ego. Bhagavan Ramana also concludes   
ULLadu Narpadu by saying, Ahandhai uru azhitale mukti. The destruction of the  
ego is liberation. But Bhagavan Ramana uses   
the phrase mano-nasam in Who am I? He does not say Ahandai nasam. For that  
matter, He never uses the word Ahandai, ego   
in Who am I? directly. This is a poser for all of us! However, He gives one  
description about ahandai or ahankaram in Who am I? He says that "I-thought  
is the first thought from the mind. And this ahankaram."

Dear srkudai,   
Yes. Ego is Ravana. As SRK said that it will be a burnt-rope,   
only when it is burnt and not otherwise. When ego is burnt,   
then there is no more role playing, because one is Rama, ever   
and unchanging.   
Arunachala Siva.

why should an enlightened person not continue playing the role of Ravana,

Quote from: Nagaraj on June 27, 2010, 01:17:46 PM  
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
In the above quote,Mr.Nagaraj has introduced the word "Echils"-food split down  
from the mouth and i thought share some good and ad aspects of "Echil".. In  
tamil this word commonly refers to saliva which we spit..Also, any food left  
over in the plate by the eater is also called "Echils" and is considered  
impure and and unhygienic for others to eat. The people who eat left over  
food(Echils)are looked down in society and also sometimes ridiculed..However,  
it is a a common sight in marriages that the food left over on the plate  
will be thrown in dust bin and will be collected by poorest of poor  
especially gypsies(Narikoravas) to satisfy their hunger.Also the left over  
food thrown in dust bin will be shared by dogs and other animals who are not  
fortunate as us.. In the orthodox brahmin families it is still a practice  
wherein the husband will eat first and the plate will not be washed and will  
have some left over food and in the same plate wife will be served food and  
here the "Echils" is very much nourished by the wife taken as prasad from  
husband and that "Echil" is not considered as unhygienic..However the same  
parent will not approve their children sharing "Echils".During Bhagavan days,  
some of orthodox devotees will wait till Bhagavan finishes eating and when he  
leaves dining hall, they will rush to collect the "Echil"(food left in  
hagavan's plate) and eat it as Bhagavan's prasad. When Bhagavan came to know  
of this practice, he did not approve of this.There was a well known saint by  
name Poondi Swamiyar wherein devotees will eat the food tasted by Poondi  
Swamiar and here "Echil" was very considered as divine and was very much  
respected.In swami suddhananda's ashram, Swami used to advice devotees in  
dining hall to leave some food("Echils") in plate for the animals in the  
ashram.   
During last days of Sri.Ramakrishna Paramahamsha, he was suffering with  
Cancer which was in advanced state.His closest aides who were were serving him  
were afraid to go near him fearing that they will also contract cancer and  
left him.On seeing this, Swami Vivekananda took a glass of liquid and gave it  
to Sri ramakrishna to drink and then Swami Vivekananda drank the left  
over(Echil) in the glass.On seeing this, Sri Ramakrishna's close aides got  
over the fear of Contracting Cancer and started serving him again.

Appearances are only projection of the mind, similarly, Ravana is a character  
projected by the mind. When the mind is merged into itself - Self, Ravana  
ceases to be, as there will be no mind for projection of Ravana.   
You have to remain as Rama (actually not even reamaing, you are 'that' Tat  
Tvam Asi), There is no way you can continue playing the role of Ravana, that  
implies that mind is still there.   
Once the mind is merged into Self, there will/should not be any appearances,  
i.e. no more any projections. There will only be Rama and Rama everywhere. No  
more roles, characters, etc...   
If it is so, that the Ravana role continues, and even if that role does not  
affect us as Rama, then still it is only projection of the Mind. Therefore  
Mind has still not merged.   
After enlightenment, realising that the cinema is not real, why do you still  
want to sit and watch the movie that is not there? movie still being continued  
- do you not think that still mind is there projecting the universe?   
Mind has to merge, this is Mano Naasam! which is - absolutely no projections  
at all and no continuing of movies or characters or is it even the  
enlightenment that the roles can continue and that it cannot affect you  
anymore.   
These are my humble views   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
 When there is no projection what so ever, its release from body as well. coz body too is a projection.   
as long as there is functioning, there is mind and there are projections. the  
projections continue as per prarabdha   
and then the person ends. along with all projections.   
Love!

A Jeevan Muktha is said to have had release from body and still exist in the  
body for **outsiders** like ourselves. It is Videha muktha what you are  
talking about.   
In Sadashiva Brahmendral, we have seen how his hands were chopped off and yet  
he continued to walk without even being aware of it. We all know how Ramana  
Maharshi had his tumor operated without even taking anesthesia.   
It only appears for outsiders like ourselves that a Jivanmukta has prarabdha,  
that they have body, etc.., but they do not have any prarabdha or body.

videha muktha is released from body. jeevan mukha has body.   
The jnani who said "I do not have body" is also appears to others only.   
When a person is in the influence of drugs u can try cutting off their body  
parts and they may move unconcerned.   
all these have happened in your view. in your peception.   
so lets speak from your perception.   
Does the jnani say u have a body? he says u too do not have a body. infact he  
says there is no u!   
and yet he is speaking. if u ask, the reply is "in ur view i am speaking to  
u".   
then how come u say a jeevan muktha has no body? No one has a body that way.   
so there is no projection even now!   
but u speak of ending a projection! which means u have already assumed there  
is a projection.   
if there is a projection, that is in ur view. then that projection ends after  
videha mukti. .. that too in your view.   
we can only speak from our standpoint. A Jeevan muktha has body and a Videha  
muktha has no body.

Dear I,   
Every thing that is being discussed is only a 'stand point' of view, which is  
only the mind's. It can never know the consciousness which is unlimited.  
whatever we try and say is only making it limited.   
A Jivan Mukta does not have a body, as consciousness, 'it' is pervaded  
everywhere and everything. No one has body. since it is projection of mind, it  
exists as sanke in rope.   
In the end, you speak from your perception and I speak from my perception.   
There is no your perception and my perception. You are talking to yourself and  
I am talking to myself. There is no You and I.   
Perception exists only for the mind. Perception is again just a projection. as  
long as the Mind exists, perception, projection, etc.. continues. When, Mano  
Naasam, all is naught.   
The games of your perception, my perception etc.. continue for the mind, is it  
not the projection of the mind?   
Quote  
we can only speak from our standpoint. A Jeevan muktha has body and a Videha  
muktha has no body.  
That everything is only the projection of the mind including the Jivanmukta  
and Videhamukta. When Mano Naasam, there is no Jivanmukta, no Videhamukta, No  
consciousness, no nothing or there is Jivanmukta, there is Videhamukta,  
Consciousness everywhere, Aatman, Brahman.   
These are all again the projections of mind.   
This mind as to merge. this is Mano naasam. As long as there are projections  
of any type, mind has not merged.

there are only two possibilities: A person with merged mind said this. which

a person whose mind is not merged is saying what will happen when mind merges.  
in this case, how does he know?

simple point... merging of mind is not absence of projection. its just veiling  
power that is eliminated.   
final merging or elimination of projection is videha mukti. not jeevan mukthi.

Dear prasanth and others,   
The problem is that we are not able to visualize a state where the   
mind is killed. Mind-killing seems to be bothering most of us.   
If you substitute ego with mind, then, we are comfortable. Everyone   
agrees that one should kill the ego. Bhagavan Ramana also concludes   
ULLadu Narpadu by saying, Ahandhai uru azhitale mukti. The destruction of the  
ego is liberation. But Bhagavan Ramana uses   
the phrase mano-nasam in Who am I? He does not say Ahandai nasam. For that  
matter, He never uses the word Ahandai, ego   
in Who am I? directly. This is a poser for all of us! However, He gives one  
description about ahandai or ahankaram in Who am I? He says that "I-thought  
is the first thought from the mind. And this ahankaram."   
Arunachala Siva.

Yes . There is no movie at all. But that does not mean the appearance has to  
change.   
These words are not there... whether u see them or not   
Quote  
Where appearances still are, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.   
Ramana was seeing all this. But not "inquiring". He was Just Being.   
For one who falls into the thoughts, who is thinking he is the doer. ..  
"inquire" is suggested.   
so, inquiry is not as long as the world appears. it is as long as one is  
thinks one is not the Self: Just Be.   
Ramana saw all this. Everything.

Dear Subramanian,   
Suppose i am playing the role of Ravana and take myself to be Ravana. I am  
Ravana is ego. I am Self is Truth.   
I am Ravana. .. as a Role.   
I am Self. .. As the Ultimate.   
The Role of Ravana need not be destroyed. If I do not know i am Ravana, i  
cannot play that role.   
I just have to know that I am Self [mentally]. And have firm conviction.   
There it ends.   
nothing more, nothing less.   
That is why Ramakrishna says "the ego is like a burnt rope", coz it no more  
creates confusion. there is clarity. i know i am playing the role of Ravana  
but all this is mithya. This is simple.   
Love!

leaves dining hall, they will rush to collect the "Echil"(food left in  
hagavan's plate) and eat it as Bhagavan's prasad. When Bhagavan came to know  
of this practice, he did not approve of this.There was a well known saint by  
name Poondi Swamiyar wherein devotees will eat the food tasted by Poondi  
Swamiar and here "Echil" was very considered as divine and was very much  
respected.In swami suddhananda's ashram, Swami used to advice devotees in  
dining hall to leave some food("Echils") in plate for the animals in the  
ashram.   
During last days of Sri.Ramakrishna Paramahamsha, he was suffering with  
Cancer which was in advanced state.His closest aides who were were serving him  
were afraid to go near him fearing that they will also contract cancer and  
left him.On seeing this, Swami Vivekananda took a glass of liquid and gave it  
to Sri ramakrishna to drink and then Swami Vivekananda drank the left  
over(Echil) in the glass.On seeing this, Sri Ramakrishna's close aides got  
over the fear of Contracting Cancer and started serving him again.

Dear I   
Quote from: srkudai on June 29, 2010, 07:54:26 AM  
When ego is burnt, still there is role playing, but one knows clearly that one  
is not ravana.   
why should an enlightened person not continue playing the role of Ravana,  
knowing pretty well that there is only Rama?   
Appearances are only projection of the mind, similarly, Ravana is a character  
projected by the mind. When the mind is merged into itself - Self, Ravana  
ceases to be, as there will be no mind for projection of Ravana.   
You have to remain as Rama (actually not even reamaing, you are 'that' Tat  
Tvam Asi), There is no way you can continue playing the role of Ravana, that  
implies that mind is still there.   
Once the mind is merged into Self, there will/should not be any appearances,  
i.e. no more any projections. There will only be Rama and Rama everywhere. No  
more roles, characters, etc...   
If it is so, that the Ravana role continues, and even if that role does not  
affect us as Rama, then still it is only projection of the Mind. Therefore  
Mind has still not merged.   
After enlightenment, realising that the cinema is not real, why do you still  
want to sit and watch the movie that is not there? movie still being continued  
- do you not think that still mind is there projecting the universe?   
Mind has to merge, this is Mano Naasam! which is - absolutely no projections  
at all and no continuing of movies or characters or is it even the  
enlightenment that the roles can continue and that it cannot affect you  
anymore.   
These are my humble views

Dear Nagaraj,   
 When there is no projection what so ever, its release from body as well. coz body too is a projection.   
as long as there is functioning, there is mind and there are projections. the  
projections continue as per prarabdha   
and then the person ends. along with all projections.   
Love!

A Jeevan Muktha is said to have had release from body and still exist in the  
body for **outsiders** like ourselves. It is Videha muktha what you are  
talking about.   
In Sadashiva Brahmendral, we have seen how his hands were chopped off and yet  
he continued to walk without even being aware of it. We all know how Ramana  
Maharshi had his tumor operated without even taking anesthesia.   
It only appears for outsiders like ourselves that a Jivanmukta has prarabdha,  
that they have body, etc.., but they do not have any prarabdha or body.

videha muktha is released from body. jeevan mukha has body.   
The jnani who said "I do not have body" is also appears to others only.   
When a person is in the influence of drugs u can try cutting off their body  
parts and they may move unconcerned.   
all these have happened in your view. in your peception.   
so lets speak from your perception.   
Does the jnani say u have a body? he says u too do not have a body. infact he  
says there is no u!   
and yet he is speaking. if u ask, the reply is "in ur view i am speaking to  
u".   
then how come u say a jeevan muktha has no body? No one has a body that way.   
so there is no projection even now!   
but u speak of ending a projection! which means u have already assumed there  
is a projection.   
if there is a projection, that is in ur view. then that projection ends after  
videha mukti. .. that too in your view.   
we can only speak from our standpoint. A Jeevan muktha has body and a Videha  
muktha has no body.

Dear I,   
Every thing that is being discussed is only a 'stand point' of view, which is  
only the mind's. It can never know the consciousness which is unlimited.  
whatever we try and say is only making it limited.   
A Jivan Mukta does not have a body, as consciousness, 'it' is pervaded  
everywhere and everything. No one has body. since it is projection of mind, it  
exists as sanke in rope.   
In the end, you speak from your perception and I speak from my perception.   
There is no your perception and my perception. You are talking to yourself and  
I am talking to myself. There is no You and I.   
Perception exists only for the mind. Perception is again just a projection. as  
long as the Mind exists, perception, projection, etc.. continues. When, Mano  
Naasam, all is naught.   
The games of your perception, my perception etc.. continue for the mind, is it  
not the projection of the mind?   
Quote  
we can only speak from our standpoint. A Jeevan muktha has body and a Videha  
muktha has no body.  
That everything is only the projection of the mind including the Jivanmukta  
and Videhamukta. When Mano Naasam, there is no Jivanmukta, no Videhamukta, No  
consciousness, no nothing or there is Jivanmukta, there is Videhamukta,  
Consciousness everywhere, Aatman, Brahman.   
These are all again the projections of mind.   
This mind as to merge. this is Mano naasam. As long as there are projections  
of any type, mind has not merged.

there are only two possibilities: A person with merged mind said this. which  
is not possible. coz for him all projections ceased.   
a person whose mind is not merged is saying what will happen when mind merges.  
in this case, how does he know?   
both cases are meaningless.   
simple point... merging of mind is not absence of projection. its just veiling  
power that is eliminated.   
final merging or elimination of projection is videha mukti. not jeevan mukthi.

Dear prasanth and others,   
The problem is that we are not able to visualize a state where the   
mind is killed. Mind-killing seems to be bothering most of us.   
If you substitute ego with mind, then, we are comfortable. Everyone   
agrees that one should kill the ego. Bhagavan Ramana also concludes   
ULLadu Narpadu by saying, Ahandhai uru azhitale mukti. The destruction of the  
ego is liberation. But Bhagavan Ramana uses   
the phrase mano-nasam in Who am I? He does not say Ahandai nasam. For that  
matter, He never uses the word Ahandai, ego   
in Who am I? directly. This is a poser for all of us! However, He gives one  
description about ahandai or ahankaram in Who am I? He says that "I-thought  
is the first thought from the mind. And this ahankaram."   
Arunachala Siva.

Yes . There is no movie at all. But that does not mean the appearance has to  
change.   
These words are not there... whether u see them or not   
Quote  
Where appearances still are, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.   
Ramana was seeing all this. But not "inquiring". He was Just Being.   
For one who falls into the thoughts, who is thinking he is the doer. ..  
"inquire" is suggested.   
so, inquiry is not as long as the world appears. it is as long as one is  
thinks one is not the Self: Just Be.   
Ramana saw all this. Everything.

Dear Subramanian,   
Suppose i am playing the role of Ravana and take myself to be Ravana. I am  
Ravana is ego. I am Self is Truth.   
I am Ravana. .. as a Role.   
I am Self. .. As the Ultimate.   
The Role of Ravana need not be destroyed. If I do not know i am Ravana, i  
cannot play that role.   
I just have to know that I am Self [mentally]. And have firm conviction.   
There it ends.   
nothing more, nothing less.   
That is why Ramakrishna says "the ego is like a burnt rope", coz it no more  
creates confusion. there is clarity. i know i am playing the role of Ravana  
but all this is mithya. This is simple.   
Love!

Quote from: Nagaraj on June 27, 2010, 01:17:46 PM  
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
In the above quote,Mr.Nagaraj has introduced the word "Echils"-food split down  
from the mouth and i thought share some good and ad aspects of "Echil".. In  
tamil this word commonly refers to saliva which we spit..Also, any food left  
over in the plate by the eater is also called "Echils" and is considered  
impure and and unhygienic for others to eat. The people who eat left over  
food(Echils)are looked down in society and also sometimes ridiculed..However,  
it is a a common sight in marriages that the food left over on the plate  
will be thrown in dust bin and will be collected by poorest of poor  
especially gypsies(Narikoravas) to satisfy their hunger.Also the left over  
food thrown in dust bin will be shared by dogs and other animals who are not  
fortunate as us.. In the orthodox brahmin families it is still a practice  
wherein the husband will eat first and the plate will not be washed and will  
have some left over food and in the same plate wife will be served food and  
here the "Echils" is very much nourished by the wife taken as prasad from  
husband and that "Echil" is not considered as unhygienic..However the same  
parent will not approve their children sharing "Echils".During Bhagavan days,  
some of orthodox devotees will wait till Bhagavan finishes eating and when he  
leaves dining hall, they will rush to collect the "Echil"(food left in  
hagavan's plate) and eat it as Bhagavan's prasad. When Bhagavan came to know  
of this practice, he did not approve of this.There was a well known saint by  
name Poondi Swamiyar wherein devotees will eat the food tasted by Poondi  
Swamiar and here "Echil" was very considered as divine and was very much  
respected.In swami suddhananda's ashram, Swami used to advice devotees in  
dining hall to leave some food("Echils") in plate for the animals in the  
ashram.   
During last days of Sri.Ramakrishna Paramahamsha, he was suffering with  
Cancer which was in advanced state.His closest aides who were were serving him  
were afraid to go near him fearing that they will also contract cancer and  
left him.On seeing this, Swami Vivekananda took a glass of liquid and gave it  
to Sri ramakrishna to drink and then Swami Vivekananda drank the left  
over(Echil) in the glass.On seeing this, Sri Ramakrishna's close aides got  
over the fear of Contracting Cancer and started serving him again.

Dear Nagaraj,   
 When there is no projection what so ever, its release from body as well. coz body too is a projection.   
as long as there is functioning, there is mind and there are projections. the  
projections continue as per prarabdha   
and then the person ends. along with all projections.   
Love!   
Silence

A Jeevan Muktha is said to have had release from body and still exist in the  
body for **outsiders** like ourselves. It is Videha muktha what you are  
talking about.   
In Sadashiva Brahmendral, we have seen how his hands were chopped off and yet  
he continued to walk without even being aware of it. We all know how Ramana  
Maharshi had his tumor operated without even taking anesthesia.   
It only appears for outsiders like ourselves that a Jivanmukta has prarabdha,  
that they have body, etc.., but they do not have any prarabdha or body.

videha muktha is released from body. jeevan mukha has body.   
The jnani who said "I do not have body" is also appears to others only.   
When a person is in the influence of drugs u can try cutting off their body  
parts and they may move unconcerned.   
all these have happened in your view. in your peception.   
so lets speak from your perception.   
Does the jnani say u have a body? he says u too do not have a body. infact he  
says there is no u!   
and yet he is speaking. if u ask, the reply is "in ur view i am speaking to  
u".   
then how come u say a jeevan muktha has no body? No one has a body that way.   
so there is no projection even now!   
but u speak of ending a projection! which means u have already assumed there  
is a projection.   
if there is a projection, that is in ur view. then that projection ends after  
videha mukti. .. that too in your view.   
we can only speak from our standpoint. A Jeevan muktha has body and a Videha  
muktha has no body.

Dear I,   
Every thing that is being discussed is only a 'stand point' of view, which is  
only the mind's. It can never know the consciousness which is unlimited.  
whatever we try and say is only making it limited.   
A Jivan Mukta does not have a body, as consciousness, 'it' is pervaded  
everywhere and everything. No one has body. since it is projection of mind, it  
exists as sanke in rope.   
In the end, you speak from your perception and I speak from my perception.   
There is no your perception and my perception. You are talking to yourself and  
I am talking to myself. There is no You and I.   
Perception exists only for the mind. Perception is again just a projection. as  
long as the Mind exists, perception, projection, etc.. continues. When, Mano  
Naasam, all is naught.   
The games of your perception, my perception etc.. continue for the mind, is it  
not the projection of the mind?   
Quote  
we can only speak from our standpoint. A Jeevan muktha has body and a Videha  
muktha has no body.  
That everything is only the projection of the mind including the Jivanmukta  
and Videhamukta. When Mano Naasam, there is no Jivanmukta, no Videhamukta, No  
consciousness, no nothing or there is Jivanmukta, there is Videhamukta,  
Consciousness everywhere, Aatman, Brahman.   
These are all again the projections of mind.   
This mind as to merge. this is Mano naasam. As long as there are projections  
of any type, mind has not merged.

there are only two possibilities: A person with merged mind said this. which  
is not possible. coz for him all projections ceased.   
a person whose mind is not merged is saying what will happen when mind merges.  
in this case, how does he know?   
both cases are meaningless.   
simple point... merging of mind is not absence of projection. its just veiling  
power that is eliminated.   
final merging or elimination of projection is videha mukti. not jeevan mukthi.

Dear prasanth and others,   
The problem is that we are not able to visualize a state where the   
mind is killed. Mind-killing seems to be bothering most of us.   
If you substitute ego with mind, then, we are comfortable. Everyone   
agrees that one should kill the ego. Bhagavan Ramana also concludes   
ULLadu Narpadu by saying, Ahandhai uru azhitale mukti. The destruction of the  
ego is liberation. But Bhagavan Ramana uses   
the phrase mano-nasam in Who am I? He does not say Ahandai nasam. For that  
matter, He never uses the word Ahandai, ego   
in Who am I? directly. This is a poser for all of us! However, He gives one  
description about ahandai or ahankaram in Who am I? He says that "I-thought  
is the first thought from the mind. And this ahankaram."   
Arunachala Siva.

Yes . There is no movie at all. But that does not mean the appearance has to  
change.   
These words are not there... whether u see them or not   
Quote  
Where appearances still are, the sage asks him to enquire its nature.   
Ramana was seeing all this. But not "inquiring". He was Just Being.   
For one who falls into the thoughts, who is thinking he is the doer. ..  
"inquire" is suggested.   
so, inquiry is not as long as the world appears. it is as long as one is  
thinks one is not the Self: Just Be.   
Ramana saw all this. Everything.

Dear Subramanian,   
Suppose i am playing the role of Ravana and take myself to be Ravana. I am  
Ravana is ego. I am Self is Truth.   
I am Ravana. .. as a Role.   
I am Self. .. As the Ultimate.   
The Role of Ravana need not be destroyed. If I do not know i am Ravana, i  
cannot play that role.   
I just have to know that I am Self [mentally]. And have firm conviction.   
There it ends.   
nothing more, nothing less.   
That is why Ramakrishna says "the ego is like a burnt rope", coz it no more  
creates confusion. there is clarity. i know i am playing the role of Ravana  
but all this is mithya. This is simple.   
Love!

Yes. Ego is Ravana. As SRK said that it will be a burnt-rope,   
only when it is burnt and not otherwise. When ego is burnt,   
then there is no more role playing, because one is Rama, ever   
and unchanging.

Quote from: Nagaraj on June 27, 2010, 01:17:46 PM  
Who am I is simply holding on to the 'I'. All the analysis are to be given  
absolutely no importance at all. one need not even learn all these  
intricacies. After all what is the real objective? is not to hold on to the  
'I'? its like, we forget the main dishes served in an plantain leaf and  
showing more interest in the "echils" \- food spilt down from our mouth.   
In the above quote,Mr.Nagaraj has introduced the word "Echils"-food split down  
from the mouth and i thought share some good and ad aspects of "Echil".. In  
tamil this word commonly refers to saliva which we spit..Also, any food left  
over in the plate by the eater is also called "Echils" and is considered  
impure and and unhygienic for others to eat. The people who eat left over  
food(Echils)are looked down in society and also sometimes ridiculed..However,  
it is a a common sight in marriages that the food left over on the plate  
will be thrown in dust bin and will be collected by poorest of poor  
especially gypsies(Narikoravas) to satisfy their hunger.Also the left over  
food thrown in dust bin will be shared by dogs and other animals who are not  
fortunate as us.. In the orthodox brahmin families it is still a practice  
wherein the husband will eat first and the plate will not be washed and will  
have some left over food and in the same plate wife will be served food and  
here the "Echils" is very much nourished by the wife taken as prasad from  
husband and that "Echil" is not considered as unhygienic..However the same  
parent will not approve their children sharing "Echils".During Bhagavan days,  
some of orthodox devotees will wait till Bhagavan finishes eating and when he  
leaves dining hall, they will rush to collect the "Echil"(food left in  
hagavan's plate) and eat it as Bhagavan's prasad. When Bhagavan came to know  
of this practice, he did not approve of this.There was a well known saint by  
name Poondi Swamiyar wherein devotees will eat the food tasted by Poondi  
Swamiar and here "Echil" was very considered as divine and was very much  
respected.In swami suddhananda's ashram, Swami used to advice devotees in  
dining hall to leave some food("Echils") in plate for the animals in the  
ashram.   
During last days of Sri.Ramakrishna Paramahamsha, he was suffering with  
Cancer which was in advanced state.His closest aides who were were serving him  
were afraid to go near him fearing that they will also contract cancer and  
left him.On seeing this, Swami Vivekananda took a glass of liquid and gave it  
to Sri ramakrishna to drink and then Swami Vivekananda drank the left  
over(Echil) in the glass.On seeing this, Sri Ramakrishna's close aides got  
over the fear of Contracting Cancer and started serving him again.

Quote from: srkudai on June 29, 2010, 07:54:26 AM  
When ego is burnt, still there is role playing, but one knows clearly that one  
is not ravana.   
why should an enlightened person not continue playing the role of Ravana,  
knowing pretty well that there is only Rama?   
Appearances are only projection of the mind, similarly, Ravana is a character  
projected by the mind. When the mind is merged into itself - Self, Ravana  
ceases to be, as there will be no mind for projection of Ravana.   
You have to remain as Rama (actually not even reamaing, you are 'that' Tat  
Tvam Asi), There is no way you can continue playing the role of Ravana, that  
implies that mind is still there.   
Once the mind is merged into Self, there will/should not be any appearances,  
i.e. no more any projections. There will only be Rama and Rama everywhere. No  
more roles, characters, etc...   
If it is so, that the Ravana role continues, and even if that role does not  
affect us as Rama, then still it is only projection of the Mind. Therefore  
Mind has still not merged.   
After enlightenment, realising that the cinema is not real, why do you still  
want to sit and watch the movie that is not there? movie still being continued  
- do you not think that still mind is there projecting the universe?   
Mind has to merge, this is Mano Naasam! which is - absolutely no projections  
at all and no continuing of movies or characters or is it even the  
enlightenment that the roles can continue and that it cannot affect you  
anymore.   
These are my humble views

we can only speak from our standpoint. A Jeevan muktha has body and a Videha  
muktha has no body.

Dear I,   
Every thing that is being discussed is only a 'stand point' of view, which is  
only the mind's. It can never know the consciousness which is unlimited.  
whatever we try and say is only making it limited.   
A Jivan Mukta does not have a body, as consciousness, 'it' is pervaded  
everywhere and everything. No one has body. since it is projection of mind, it  
exists as sanke in rope.   
In the end, you speak from your perception and I speak from my perception.   
There is no your perception and my perception. You are talking to yourself and  
I am talking to myself. There is no You and I.   
Perception exists only for the mind. Perception is again just a projection. as  
long as the Mind exists, perception, projection, etc.. continues. When, Mano  
Naasam, all is naught.   
The games of your perception, my perception etc.. continue for the mind, is it  
not the projection of the mind?   
Quote  
we can only speak from our standpoint. A Jeevan muktha has body and a Videha  
muktha has no body.  
That everything is only the projection of the mind including the Jivanmukta  
and Videhamukta. When Mano Naasam, there is no Jivanmukta, no Videhamukta, No  
consciousness, no nothing or there is Jivanmukta, there is Videhamukta,  
Consciousness everywhere, Aatman, Brahman.   
These are all again the projections of mind.   
This mind as to merge. this is Mano naasam. As long as there are projections  
of any type, mind has not merged.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

there are only two possibilities: A person with merged mind said this. which  
is not possible. coz for him all projections ceased.   
a person whose mind is not merged is saying what will happen when mind merges.  
in this case, how does he know?   
both cases are meaningless.   
simple point... merging of mind is not absence of projection. its just veiling  
power that is eliminated.   
final merging or elimination of projection is videha mukti. not jeevan mukthi.

As a whole, your projection and my projection is my projection to myself and  
similarly, As a whole, your projection and my projection is your projection to

So long these projections continue, so long there is mind which is not merged.   
There is nothing more discuss or rather project from here.

Dear Nagaraj & viswanthan,   
I shall cover only the explanation given for "Echil", the Tamizh word.   
This word is used in both occasions, i.e. 1) referring to the saliva that is  
coming out of the mouth and 2) the left-overs of the food [perhaps since it  
contains a touch of saliva while eating]. A Guru's or Jnani's left over of  
the food is considered sacred and it is called Ucchishtam. This is taken by  
the devotees. This Ucchishtam also   
includes the drinking water from a tumbler partly used by the guru.   
[An extreme case of Ucchishtam is taking the water from a basin,   
where guru's pada were cleaned with water while entering the house. This  
water is consumed by the devotees!]   
In Bhagavan Ramana's time, this taking of left over food was   
practiced by some devotees in the early years. They were also taking the  
water from the tumbler which Bhagavan Ramana had used while taking food. This  
is was found out by Bhagavan, from a little girl who was waiting for Bhagavan  
to finish His lunch and get up, so that she could take the water from the  
tumbler. After this, Bhagavan Ramana saw to it that there was no water left  
behind. He chided the devotees also.   
The food ucchishtam again was observed by the devotees, in a SELECTIVE way!  
That is, in the lunch when Mudaliar Patti's food was served on Bhagavan's  
leaf, it was considered "not suitable" for devotees to sit at the same leaf  
and eat food. So they were doing this at night-meals. Bhagavan Ramana also  
noticed this and started taking the leaf Himself and placing it on the  
dustbin.   
Once Muruganar wanted to take this Ucchishtam. When he went for in the  
morning for sitting before that leaf of Bhagavan that had contained left  
overs, he was prevented saying the Mudaliar Patti's food had been served there  
and so it was 'unsuitable'!   
Muruganar felt bad. While dogs are eligible for that food, I am not. What a  
pity?   
He wrote a poem which reads roughly as-   
This Brahma does not know, not even Vedas but   
Also how to give births to jivas.   
If he had given me a dog's birth, I would have eaten   
 that food!   
He has made me a Brahmin and thus disqualifed me for this great   
 fortune!   
This song is in Sri Ramana Sannidhi Murai. It starts as Thachariyatha  
chaturmari paarpaan....... It is a single verse, and titled as Ucchishta  
Vaibhavam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Ramana also mentioned that he had pain!   
without thoughts can Ramana had pain. .. !!??!!??!!   
As Consciousness Ramana or u or me. .. we do not have a body also. so no pain  
or thought.   
This is so even now.   
and in the relative sense the body and thoughts are there.   
coz the relative is mithya, they are said to be non-existent.   
being mithya, they continue to appear, but we know they are like mirage.   
that's jivan mukthi.   
not absence of perception.

well said udai garu.   
Moreover manonasha is not absolute destruction of mind as few people  
misinterpret guru ramana's teachings saying that he meant absolute destruction  
of mind.Killing of ego is the main key point and there is no need to stop and  
kill thoughts but control of thoughts is required and as lord krishna says in  
bhagavad gita it is possible by constant practice and detachment though it is  
very very difficult.   
Lets say i feel hungry and ask for food if someone comes and say that is only  
your thought so please remove that thought. How do i feel :-)   
Quote  
D: That means the manonasha or the ahamkara nasha. **The destruction of the  
mind or of the ego you speak of is then not an absolute destruction.   
M: Yes. The mind gets clear of impurities and become pure enough to reflect  
the truth, the real Self.This is impossible when the ego is active and  
assertive.**

Dear Nagaraj & viswanthan,   
I shall cover only the explanation given for "Echil", the Tamizh word.   
This word is used in both occasions, i.e. 1) referring to the saliva that is  
coming out of the mouth and 2) the left-overs of the food [perhaps since it  
contains a touch of saliva while eating]. A Guru's or Jnani's left over of  
the food is considered sacred and it is called Ucchishtam. This is taken by  
the devotees. This Ucchishtam also   
includes the drinking water from a tumbler partly used by the guru.   
[An extreme case of Ucchishtam is taking the water from a basin,   
where guru's pada were cleaned with water while entering the house. This  
water is consumed by the devotees!]   
In Bhagavan Ramana's time, this taking of left over food was   
practiced by some devotees in the early years. They were also taking the  
water from the tumbler which Bhagavan Ramana had used while taking food. This  
is was found out by Bhagavan, from a little girl who was waiting for Bhagavan  
to finish His lunch and get up, so that she could take the water from the  
tumbler. After this, Bhagavan Ramana saw to it that there was no water left  
behind. He chided the devotees also.   
The food ucchishtam again was observed by the devotees, in a SELECTIVE way!  
That is, in the lunch when Mudaliar Patti's food was served on Bhagavan's  
leaf, it was considered "not suitable" for devotees to sit at the same leaf  
and eat food. So they were doing this at night-meals. Bhagavan Ramana also  
noticed this and started taking the leaf Himself and placing it on the  
dustbin.   
Once Muruganar wanted to take this Ucchishtam. When he went for in the  
morning for sitting before that leaf of Bhagavan that had contained left  
overs, he was prevented saying the Mudaliar Patti's food had been served there  
and so it was 'unsuitable'!   
Muruganar felt bad. While dogs are eligible for that food, I am not. What a  
pity?   
He wrote a poem which reads roughly as-   
This Brahma does not know, not even Vedas but   
Also how to give births to jivas.   
If he had given me a dog's birth, I would have eaten   
 that food!   
He has made me a Brahmin and thus disqualifed me for this great   
 fortune!   
This song is in Sri Ramana Sannidhi Murai. It starts as Thachariyatha  
chaturmari paarpaan....... It is a single verse, and titled as Ucchishta  
Vaibhavam.   
Arunachala Siva.

well said udai garu.   
Moreover manonasha is not absolute destruction of mind as few people  
misinterpret guru ramana's teachings saying that he meant absolute destruction  
of mind.Killing of ego is the main key point and there is no need to stop and  
kill thoughts but control of thoughts is required and as lord krishna says in  
bhagavad gita it is possible by constant practice and detachment though it is  
very very difficult.   
Lets say i feel hungry and ask for food if someone comes and say that is only  
your thought so please remove that thought. How do i feel :-)   
Quote  
D: That means the manonasha or the ahamkara nasha. **The destruction of the  
mind or of the ego you speak of is then not an absolute destruction.   
M: Yes. The mind gets clear of impurities and become pure enough to reflect  
the truth, the real Self.This is impossible when the ego is active and  
assertive.**

But who says mind has to be merged?   
1\. he whose mind is merged, cannot say.   
2\. he whose mind is not merged... how does he know what happens when mind is  
merged? how can he say whether mind has to be merged?   
and this argument can also be found in panchadasi ! its not mine own.   
jeevan mukthi is not videha mukthi.

But who says mind has to be merged?   
1\. he whose mind is merged, cannot say.   
2\. he whose mind is not merged... how does he know what happens when mind is  
merged? how can he say whether mind has to be merged?   
and this argument can also be found in panchadasi ! its not mine own.

Dear Nagaraj & viswanthan,   
I shall cover only the explanation given for "Echil", the Tamizh word.   
This word is used in both occasions, i.e. 1) referring to the saliva that is  
coming out of the mouth and 2) the left-overs of the food [perhaps since it  
contains a touch of saliva while eating]. A Guru's or Jnani's left over of  
the food is considered sacred and it is called Ucchishtam. This is taken by  
the devotees. This Ucchishtam also   
includes the drinking water from a tumbler partly used by the guru.   
[An extreme case of Ucchishtam is taking the water from a basin,   
where guru's pada were cleaned with water while entering the house. This  
water is consumed by the devotees!]   
In Bhagavan Ramana's time, this taking of left over food was   
practiced by some devotees in the early years. They were also taking the  
water from the tumbler which Bhagavan Ramana had used while taking food. This  
is was found out by Bhagavan, from a little girl who was waiting for Bhagavan  
to finish His lunch and get up, so that she could take the water from the  
tumbler. After this, Bhagavan Ramana saw to it that there was no water left  
behind. He chided the devotees also.   
The food ucchishtam again was observed by the devotees, in a SELECTIVE way!  
That is, in the lunch when Mudaliar Patti's food was served on Bhagavan's  
leaf, it was considered "not suitable" for devotees to sit at the same leaf  
and eat food. So they were doing this at night-meals. Bhagavan Ramana also  
noticed this and started taking the leaf Himself and placing it on the  
dustbin.   
Once Muruganar wanted to take this Ucchishtam. When he went for in the  
morning for sitting before that leaf of Bhagavan that had contained left  
overs, he was prevented saying the Mudaliar Patti's food had been served there  
and so it was 'unsuitable'!   
Muruganar felt bad. While dogs are eligible for that food, I am not. What a  
pity?   
He wrote a poem which reads roughly as-   
This Brahma does not know, not even Vedas but   
Also how to give births to jivas.   
If he had given me a dog's birth, I would have eaten   
 that food!   
He has made me a Brahmin and thus disqualifed me for this great   
 fortune!   
This song is in Sri Ramana Sannidhi Murai. It starts as Thachariyatha  
chaturmari paarpaan....... It is a single verse, and titled as Ucchishta  
Vaibhavam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Ramana also mentioned that he had pain!   
without thoughts can Ramana had pain. .. !!??!!??!!   
As Consciousness Ramana or u or me. .. we do not have a body also. so no pain  
or thought.   
This is so even now.   
and in the relative sense the body and thoughts are there.   
coz the relative is mithya, they are said to be non-existent.   
being mithya, they continue to appear, but we know they are like mirage.   
that's jivan mukthi.   
not absence of perception.
