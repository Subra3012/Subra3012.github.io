Dear Subramaniyan ji   
When we never born and never die why we have to celebrate birthday and srardh  
ceremoney? These practices only for are non realised people? Or knowingly we  
have to do for others to give respect to their believes

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 Birthday celebrations are due crytallisation of identity with the body.Every birthday celebration deepens that identity.   
 Sradh is an opportunity to show our gratitude and to wish welfare for the departed soul.

Dear Raju,   
The replies for my 3 mails, i.e. prayer,birthday, how to tackle with others  
are given very beautifully. Thanks for your nice explaination. As Srkudai  
says, you are not only sadhakas but more understanding of Bhagavan's teachings  
jnanis.   
I will keep in my mind all the points from on wards.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Birth day and death day are not there only for Jnanis, who have   
overcome birth and death. For we, the seekers, these have to   
be observed, as Dr. Raju and srkduai said, to remember more   
intently the Jnanis' advent and their liberation from the body and   
above all their teachings and guidance.   
Arunachala Siva.
