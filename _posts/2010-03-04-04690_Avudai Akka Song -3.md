In the 19th and early 20th century, it was common amongst all Hindus   
to celebrate the attainment puberty and first menstruation of the girl child.   
There used to be a lot of happy exchanges of words, greetings, eats and   
dance and music at home. This has fallent into disuse.   
Akka sings one such celebration, with a pageant, with inbuilt advaitic  
meaning.   
"Vidya" has become "a big lady" today.   
Let us celebrate. Oh girls, come.   
Upanishad, Brahmasutram, Vedas and Yoga Vasishta came   
 as best girls.   
They make fun of Vidya, apply kumkum, and sandal paste on her face.   
They ask her to sit "one corner" called meditation on God.   
They dance and sing the music of non dual consciousness.   
They distribute laddus of ananda, the payasam of satsangh.   
Let us celebrate, come.   
Here comes the Guru, the grand old ma of the house,   
She tells Vidya to do this and not to do that.   
"Do not jump here and there, (with your thoughts)   
It will pain your belly (mind).   
Keep silent and listen to songs and dance of Upanishads.   
The four day celebrations are over.   
*   
Vidya comes out (of isolation) and has her Holy Bath of Self Realization.   
The girls go away, saying that they have no more work with her.   
The grandold ma of the house looks at Vidya.   
"O Vidya looks really matured.   
She talks a little, she sings a little, she moves with dexterity.   
She eats a little, she sleeps a little,   
Always in the state of Self realization!"   
Arunachala Siva.

How an ignorant ever understand the Heart of a Jnani?   
How to explain this Heart, how can he ever understand?   
How can a hollow bamboo ever understand the fragrance of the sandal wood?   
How can an old owl understand the dance of the Peacock?   
How can a donkey understand the Arabian horse?   
How can the well water taste like nectar?   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Have you already wrote the life history of Avudai Akka story. If not please  
Her story.   
I do not know about Avudai except she went to papanasam in kuralam and she did  
not   
turn. It was Adi Amavasai day.

Avudai Akka was born in Chengottai town near Tirunelveli, in Tamil Nadu. Not  
many details are available about her. She was uneducated, a childhood widow  
and had the Jnana right from her very young age. She came north to other  
parts of Tamil Nadu. She chose the banks of Kaveri river and was staying in  
some house. The providence demanded that she needed a guru. Once Tiruvisai   
Nallur Sridhara Ayyaval came to the town. He was received with   
poorna kumbam by the villagers. When Avudai Akka also came to that to him,  
since she was a widow with a tonsured head, she was asked to go away from that  
place. Ayyaval was talking to her and found immediately that she was a great  
Jnana sadhaki and also needed a guru. Just because Ayyaval talked to her, the  
people also left him without completing the formalities of receiving him.  
Ayyaval told her to come to the banks of Kaveri, at a particular place to  
receive diksha and mantra diksha. She did accordingly and had the Rama Nama as  
mantra and also sannyasa diksha. Seeing this, the villagers spread scandal  
about her and him. Hence they parted ways. Avudai Akka wrote a number of  
simple Vedantic songs.   
There must at least be more than 500 such songs. But only about   
200 songs are available. The songs are published by Tapovanam   
Jnanandagiri Swamigal Trust.   
She went to several places spreading her advaitic message. She   
went to the falls of Kutralam near Chengottai, near Tiruneveli and climbed the  
hills and never returned.   
Her songs are quite popular in southern Tamil Nadu. Bhagavan   
Ramana's Mother Azhagammal used to sing these songs.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Thank you very much for this information. I heard Akka went to papanasam on  
Adi amavasai and attained siddhi.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
You are also correct. Papanasam is a huge deep lake on the hill   
of Kutralam, from where the water-falls gush down. It is like the   
small tank in Talakaveri from where Kaveri starts her journey.   
Avudai Akka must have gone to this lake Papanasam atop the hill   
of Kutralam and have attained videha mukti. I have since found out   
a book of mine, where the biography of Avadai Akka, in brief, is available. I  
shall post the contents in due course.   
Avudai or Avadai in Tamil means the base on which Siva Lingam is   
installed in Siva temples. This is symbolic of female principle.   
In Sankaran Kovil, near Tirunelveli, the goddess Gomathi is called   
Avudai.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Thanks for the reply. Regarding Audai, there is a temple called Audaiyar koil  
near Pudukkotai. Temple was built by Manikkavachkar. Here there is no Shiva  
Lingam. Only Avudai is there. Shiva is here worshiped as subtle form.Daily  
they offer hot rice and bitter gurard. The steaming hot is offered like  
neivedyam. Shiva is Atmanathar. Temple is unique one. Every one should visit  
this temple to see the sculptures.   
There is no Nandhi and dwajasthambam.

Regarding Avudaiyar Kovil, what you have mentioned is correct.   
This temple is called Tiruperundurai in the poems of Manikkavachagar.   
Estoerically, Tiru+Perun-durai means, the great shore, the shore   
of Sivam, Awareness, which one can reach only when one prays to   
Siva and cross the ocean of samsara. In this temple, there is no   
Lingam which is the phallic symbol. Only the female principle is there. It  
is the temple constructed by Manikkavavchagar with   
the money given by Pandyan King for purchasing horses! The saint   
underwent innumerable misery with the severe punishment of the king. Finally  
he attained the Realization and merged with Nataraja in the Chidambaram  
Temple. In this place Siva appeared as a Brahmin and gave pada-diksha and  
then asked him to build the   
temple. In TirupaLLi Ezhuchi in Tiruvachakam, the saint says: Tiruperundurai koilum kaatti   
Andahanan avathum kaatti vandhu andaay,   
Aaramudhe paLLi ezhuntharulaaye....   
You showed me, (the place for) Tiruperundurai temple   
You showed me as a Brahmin and took over me.   
O Siva, please wake up.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji.   
Shiva came as a guru to Manikkavachakar. This shows when the student becomes  
ripened to obtain upadesam   
guru comes directly to student. For long time I want to know the meaning for  
the lines "andhanan avadum   
katti because I read Manikkavachakar was born in brahman family. Then why he  
sang like this. From your post this doubt is cleared. Hear Andhanan means true  
brahman. The man who is born in brahman family is not true brahman but who  
attains brahma jnanam (self knowledge) he is a true brahmanan i.e andhanan. He  
sang this paLLiezhuchi in Thruvannamalai which is a guru for all mankind. It  
is said THRUVANNAMALAIYAI NINAITHALE MUKTHI. Just who thinks the sacred  
mountain, he may attain mukthi.   
Thanks.
