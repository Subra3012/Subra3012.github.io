## Who am I? as aid to self-realization

Dear friends, yesterday I wrote about, how difficult it is to   
eschew both dislikes and likes. Bhagavan has also said in   
the Who am I? " Since all actions are done by one Parameshwara   
Sakti, who not we abide by it, and instsead always think, that,   
I will do this and I will do that." For a first reading, it may look   
simple. But it is difficult to practise. We are always planning in   
life. We plan for getting married, raising children, buying a   
cottage, planning in January itself as to how to celebrate   
Christmas etc., etc., Bhagavan says: Do not constantly think   
and plan." I tried to follow it by saying that I shall not plan for more   
than one hour job. In the morning after coffee, I think that I will   
do pre-bath prayers. During bath, I think only about next one hour,   
say, post-bath prayers like chanting Gayatri, Namasivaya mantra etc.   
During food time, I think, I shall for the next one hour read only   
the news papers and Who am I? I do not think about going to ATM   
and going to marketplace etc., which are scheduled for the next day.   
But, friends, it is very very difficult to keep it up. Please try.   
Arunachala Siva.

"Who am i" is a process of directing our attention selfwards there by  
preventing the attention going away from ourself toward something that appears  
other than ourself.   
Once we do this the apparent oscillation of the consciousness is not there and  
we have direct experience of adjunct free,thought excluding basic form of self  
conscious being.When we posit ourselves in the souce of mind,there is an  
experience of absence of mind(naiva manasam).   
The quest of the source of the "me"(whence am i)and the enquiry into the  
nature of "me"(who am i)is real equiry(Nija vicharana).   
Thinking is going out.Going in is not really going in,it is simply stopping  
going out,so nonthinking is going in(Antarmukha).   
Truth(awareness)is revealed more in the process of self-enquiry.   
Through self-enquiry we get to the fundamental core of truth underlying all  
religions,there by we go beyond religions,instead we understand what  
religiosity is.   
With self-enquiry there is the discovery of nature of self consciousness.   
With self-enquiry attraction to nonself is nullified and awareness gets  
internalised.   
We must go beyond clinging to husk of mere rituals and ceremonies and start  
sincere self-scrutiny.   
Truth is to be experienced and self-enquiry is the way to it.Mere intellectual  
knowledge does not lead to truth.   
Once we taste the bliss of truth,the never ending blissful journey of eternal  
life starts.   
The inner quest to know the source of the mind and to abide ther is the art of  
self-enquiry.   
In self-enquiry we understand what we are.There is no attempt to change  
it.That very awareness transforms what we are.   
In self-enquiry we shall know the living truth.An attempt to reach the truth  
thought i.e mental activity is the very denial of truth.   
With self-enquiry there happens a conscious union of "Pure ego"with Pure self  
conscious being.   
With self-enquiry we are blessed with the capacity to see the essential which  
is eternal.   
With self-enquiry Pure consciousness remains and limitations become extinct.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, you are correct. Banishing all other   
thoughts that take us outside is the most difficult thing   
in life.   
Arunachala Siva.
