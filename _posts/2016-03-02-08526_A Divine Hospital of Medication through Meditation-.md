(The above article is by Shilpi Virupakshi Davangere, a civil engineer, who  
gained solace at the   
feet of his Master, Sri Ramana Maharshi. The article appeared in Mountain  
Path, Jan - Mar. 2016)   
*   
It is now way back - twenty five years ago - than an intimate spiritual bond  
got established between us   
and Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi. We visited Sri Ramanasramam in the year  
1990. Fifteen of us   
reached Tiruvannamalai from Davangere, Karnataka, by bus to have Bhagavan's  
darshan. It was as if   
Bhagavan Himself had invited us to His abode.   
I had had many divine experiences by then, and at the time my mind was always  
in an ethereal state.   
These cosmic experiences were so new and strange that I felt like exclaiming  
'What, what is it...?,   
just as Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa did when he first had divine experiences.  
The differentiation   
between the real and the unreal (Ishvara and Nashwara) was vivid in my being.  
The quintessence of   
Sri Ramana Maharshi's sayings \-- the 'I' manifested everywhere; and there  
nothing existing other than   
the divine 'I' \- became part of my consciousness, leaving me in a permanent  
state of joyousness (ananda)   
My Sadguru, Sri Shishunaala Sherief, was a mystic and divine master from a  
small village in Haveri   
district. Through his spiritual songs and divinity, he made it well known  
place in India. His songs are   
always very dear to me and ever hover on my tongue. Sri Shishunaala Sherief  
says, 'Know yourself'   
(Ninda nee thiluko).   
Guru Ramana's philosophy begins with the same thought \- Who am I?

As I crossed the arch of Sri Ramanasramam, a deep silence enveloped me, in  
which I felt ever abided,   
having been there many many ages and that I would be forever. I felt that the  
Asramam could give   
the true seeker the experience of being in Mount Kailash, the abode of Lord  
Siva,and perhaps an even   
better one. A seeker like myself, who is still in the bondage of the physical  
body, would find it difficult to   
control mind and body in a challenging place such as the Himalayas. The cold  
and the scarcity of food and water would distract me.   
In Tiruvannamalai I realized that Lord Siva, Kailashapathi Himself, had  
incarnated on earth as Sri Ramana.   
My quest, yearning, delusions and dualities were quenched by the master's  
divine grace and mercy,   
elevating my mind to a deep state of meditation. I found no difference  
between Sri Shishunaala Sherief   
(my first Guru) and Sri Ramana Maharshi. I realized that it is Lord Siva who  
dwells in the lotus hearts   
of both the souls.   
In the ocean of life, with its enormous ebbs and tides Bhagavan drew me into  
the deep ocean of silence.   
Later I received His guidance and teachings through His writings. His words  
were like an oasis in the desert.   
Advaita is not easily understandable, but Bhagavan made it sound familiar and  
easily attainable. This is   
what makes Him a unique master. More than His words and teachings, Sri Ramana  
Himself became very   
dear to me. He is a true father, a loving mother, a divine friend, an eternal  
Sadguru. His simplicity,   
desirelessness, freedom from all passions, and His teaching that only 'I'  
exists and nothing else, His state   
of ever abiding in the 'I' made a deep impression on me.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.

Sometimes my heart wept and melted, looking at the photos of Bhagavan when He  
sat on the hot rocks   
of Arunachala, caring nothing for the sun's heat that scorched His human form.  
At His Asramam He   
fed us with delicious food, and soothed our bodies and souls under the cool  
roofs. Such motherliness   
makes my heart melt and tears come to my eyes. We are indeed fortunate to  
have a father and master   
like Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi.   
Bhagavan silently summons us every year. We, a group of ten to fifteen, come  
once or twice a year   
and stay for three to four days in Sri Ramanasramam under His divine care.  
Bhagavan takes us into   
deep meditation, immersing our karmic minds in the divine water of the  
invisible Ganges, eliminating   
all obstacles and washing out the impurities of the mind, to realize the only  
'I'. In the twenty five   
years that we have made our annual journeys to Tiruvannamalai we became  
acquainted with Sri   
Ramanasramam, Arunachala Hill, the Arunachala Temple, the Giri Pradakshina  
route and the railway   
station which brings us to Him. Beyond these places, we never felt the need  
to go as the whole world   
lies within Sri Ramanasramam.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.

For many years we traveled by bus from Bangalore to Tiruvannamalai. About two  
years ago, we were   
pleasantly surprised to hear that a train from Kurla to Yashwantpur would  
continue on to Pondicherry,   
through Tiruvannamalai. It seemed that Ramana Himself had organized a train  
from Davangere to   
Tiruvannamalai. Is not this a true example of Bhagavan's affection towards His  
devotees.   
Sri Allamma Prabhu, the great Shiva sharana (devotee of Lord Siva) of the 12th  
century in Karnakata   
and Nijaguna Siva Yogi of the 15th century, were Masters and Jnanis and were  
praised and loved by   
Sri Ramana. Bhagavan read the writings of these two great personalities and  
sometimes guided His   
devotees by narrating instances about them.   
Like the sixty three Tamizh Nayanmars, the Siva sharanas of the 12th century  
were devotees of Lord   
Siva, who strove only for his love and grace and created a spiritual  
atmosphere wherever they went.   
The period of the Saranas is considered a period of great spiritual  
revolution. People of all castes came   
together to attain the knowledge and bliss and were transformed into Maha Siva  
Saranas. They wrote   
about their spiritual experiences and their way of life in verses called  
Vachanas.

Allama Prabhu was the first leader of the assembly (Shoonya Simhasanandheesha)  
at the Anubhava   
Mantapa, the place where the Siva Sharanas met everyday and shared their  
spiritual experiences.   
He guided many devotees on the path of Advaita. One of his vachanas is as  
follows: Karpuradha giriyamele aragina kambaviddhuyahdha kande,   
Aragina kambadhamele hamsaviddhudha kande,   
Kamba bendhu, Hamsa haariththu noda, Guheswara.   
Guheswara is his Ankitha Nama   
The Lord of the great secret.   
I found a pillar of wax on a mound of camphor,   
I found a swan on the pillar of wax,   
The pillar burnt and the bird flew away, Guheswara.   
Here, the mound of camphor represents the mundane world, the pillar of wax  
represents the human being,   
and the hamsa -- the swan represents the self. When the body consciousness is  
burnt, then the self is   
awakened towards liberation. One day, as I was circumambulating Bhagavan's  
shrine, my mind withdrew   
itself and my eyes closed without my knowledge. My tread slowed, and I was  
plunged into the Samadhi,   
deep in the self, unaware of the surroundings, place and time. Another day, at  
dawn, in one of the rooms   
in Sri Ramanasramam allotted to us, sitting on bed, I kept gazing at  
Arunachala Hill through window.   
Watching the Hill, my mind and eyes were stilled, and I could not withdraw my  
sight from the vision of   
Arunachala Hill through the window. I sat like this for hours, drawn inwards  
into deep meditation. When   
I regained consciousness of the outer world, it was dusk. I had lost myself  
in the Self the whole day, as   
Sri Guru Ramana says. During recent visits, such a state of meditation  
persists as long as we stay in   
Sri Ramanasramam. These deeper meditational experiences were beyond anything  
I had imagined.   
Bhagavan was ever in the state of Samadhi (awareness of the Self) from His  
17th year to His 70th,   
and even in the absence of His mortal body, He exists everywhere in Sri  
Ramanasramam and its vicinity.   
This made a deep impact on me and is perhaps the cause of my experiences.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.

We have been to several Ashrams all over India. But Sri Ramanasramam stands  
unique and is the true   
Asramam for sadhana towards liberation or self realization. There is no place  
for ego, money, worldly   
matters or other mundane activities. The Asramam can aptly be called  
Kalpatharu, as it satisfies the   
yearning of seekers in search of true silence, meditation, peace and self  
realization.   
Though Sri Ramana Maharshi is not in His mortal body, He still is regarded as  
the monarch of the   
place and the Asramam is run as per His wish and guidance. People from  
various corners of the world,   
who are His devotees and true seekers of knowledge come here to stay and have  
His darshan. They   
relish the love and grace of the Master and experience the joy and bliss found  
nowhere else. Devotees   
stay in the Asramam for three to four days and return to their homes. Some  
are fortunate enough   
to stay there permanently. Parayana (chanting of the Vedas), Narayana Seva (  
feeding the poor and   
the needy), meditation, Prasadam for devotees, circumambulating the Hill and  
the Guru's Samadhi   
are some of the regular routines in Sri Ramanasramam. And Bhagavan's  
Presence is experienced   
in all these activities. His presence is also seen in the acts and deeds of  
all who serve in the Asramam -   
the cooks, laborers, Ashramites running the library and the management  
personnel. It is His discipline,   
philosophy, simplicity and perfection in every act that is reflected in  
everyone, and it assures us of His   
continuing presence. Silence speaks more than words and there resides a deep  
calm and peace everywhere.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.

Sri Ramana Maharshi has become the breath of our life, and without Him, we  
cannot exist. He is our   
philosophical deity. Meditation occurs spontaneously in the vicinity of His  
Samadhi. A serene feeling   
always exists within the premises of the Asramam. He condenses all thoughts,  
liquidates them and silences   
the mind. He becomes the discoverer of the 'I' in us. There are thousands of  
masters in the world, who   
are giving diksha and upadesa. Sri Ramana never thought of Himself as a  
Master or as one who gives diksha   
and upadesa to devotees. But directed by His devotees towards the path of  
self realization just by His   
presence and divine silence.   
There is a saying, 'The presence and divinity of a Sharana is best experienced  
and witnessed after death.'   
Guru Ramana left His mortal coil in 1950 and is presence is even more alive  
and more intensely felt now.   
He who did not care for food, clothing and shelter, He who just wore a loin  
cloth, begged alms and burnt   
Himself in the scorching sun without awareness of the external body, now so  
affectionately and caringly   
provides us with cool rooms and delicious food, and envelops us with the  
blanket of self knowledge.   
Guru Ramana is the supreme example of a real Guru.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.

We truly forget the presence of the overcrowded, ego driven ignorant and  
messed up world outside us.   
It is a wonderful surprise that such a secluded place exists on this earth,  
that can enlighten and elevate   
us above all vasanas. Sri Ramanasramam is not abode for worldly people. One  
must have practiced intense   
penance in previous lives in order to step into such an Asramam and have  
spiritual experiences.   
Sri Ramanasramam is the ultimate destination for a true seeker of the Self. I  
see the devotees in the   
Asramam, and I can in no way think that there are ordinary people. I feel the  
presence of great rishis,   
sadhus, and Jnanis among them. The devotees who have come from far off lands  
in search of such a   
destination, dedicating their lives at His feet, truly belong to this place. I  
feel inferior to them when I   
see them chanting Sri Rudram and singing Tamizh parayana. Guru Ramana shows  
no discrimination   
between the rich and poor, black and white, literate and illiterate. East and  
West and showers His grace   
through His divine look according to each person's inner capacity and  
yearning.   
I bow in thanks to Lord Guru Ramana Mahadeva for having created this divine  
temple of self knowledge   
for His devotees on this earth.   
concluded.   
Arunachala Siva.
