Theories are but ways of putting words together. Theories are neither right  
nor wrong. They are   
attempts to explain the inexplicable. The theory does not matter half so much  
as the way it is being tested,   
put into practice. Sincerity, earnestness, and full of concentration are what  
counts, not the theory itself.   
After a few days in Chennai, we drove to Tiruvannmalai. For the first two  
hours of the drive,our discussions   
continued. Back and forth our presuppositions flew, often wrestling like two  
mad monsters!   
At once moment, about five or so kilometers from Arunachala, we simultaneously  
looked up and, there it was,   
Arunachala, looming auspiciously through the front windshield, towering right  
in front of us. It was my   
sister's first darshan of Arunachala. I had previously seen it on numerous  
occasions,seen it exclusively   
as a mountain.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
