## miserliness

A holy man went to the house of a miser for alms. The miser inspite of knowing  
him to be a holy man was reluctant to spend anything. So he sent his servant  
to inform the holy man that he is not at home. The servant said to the holy  
man: "Sir, my master is not at home."   
The holy man caught a glimpse of the householder peeping from a window on the  
upper storeys of the building. He said to the servant: "If your master is busy, I can wait for sometime."   
The servant says: "There is no use waiting. It is not known when my master will return. He has  
gone for a long trip."   
The holy man understood the situation, uttered some blessings and left.   
Before leaving he said to the servant: "Tell your master that in future when he goes for a long trip, he should not  
leave his head in the window."   
(from a satsang)

Bhagavan Ramana showed "miserliness" in a noble and instructive   
way. He used to take out the tooth-powder that is kept in paper   
pack and and used for the day. Whenever, He found the tooth-   
powder to be in excess, He used to keep refolded into the packet   
and use it for the day.   
He used to take less than a spoon of oil before bath, rubbed it   
on His head and also throughout His body and then go for bath.   
Kunju Swami wondered: How can that little oil spread out to the   
head and whole body?   
Once Bhagavan Ramana was seen in the kitchen store, picking up,   
every seed of mustard that had carelessly been thrown on the floor,   
cleaned it with His towel and then placed them in the tin kept   
for that purpose! He did the same thing with rice grains when   
supplies were downladed from a lorry in gunny bags, (I think during   
one of the Jayanti celebrations), and a few rice grains had fallen   
from the holes in the gunny bags.   
He told Viswantatha Swami, who was wondering at this stenous   
act of picking rice grains: "Do not think I am miserly. These are   
all Arunachala's property. I am supposed to protect every bit of them!"   
I bow to that Ati-varnsrami.   
Arunachala Siva.
