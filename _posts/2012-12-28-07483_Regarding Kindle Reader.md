## Topic: Regarding Kindle Reader

Dear Friends   
I love reading lot of books especially related to Yoga, Spirituality etc and  
since my book shelves are getting overloaded, I have decided to shift to  
ebooks. Right now many of Bhagwan's books I read as PDF's on my computer and  
I am sure in future there will be Kindle versions of the same available.   
Right now I have installed Kindle Reader software on my computer and have  
started to purchase many books from amazon.com in Kindle format and so reading  
those books via Kindle reader software on my PC. I am now interested in  
getting an amazon Kindle reader itself.   
I am not interested in getting any new Tablets like IPAD /Samsung etc as my  
primary purpose is just reading books (available on amazon Kindle ) and not  
much interested in the various Apps for tablets etc. Having books on Kindle  
reader will save me carrying books when I travel and also when the power ( TN  
has notorious power cuts that will only escalate in Summer ) is off I can read  
it without bothering to log in on my computer. Kindle Reader has ability to  
have hundreds of books saved in it and has a very long battery life unlike  
Laptops and get charged easily and also light weight.   
Among the various Kindle version available I prefer to get "Kindle  
Papwerwhite ", that gives the ability to read also in dark without a night  
lamp.   
Has anyone of you got the above Kindle or any versions of the Kindle.   
Kindly share your views ?   
Om Peace
