Erich Segal died last Sunday in his London home. He became famous   
after his book The Love Story, which was his first book and later   
a Hollywood movie. He was 33 then! It gave him tons of money   
for the rest of his life.   
Erich Segal was born to a Jewish parents in New York. His father   
was a Jewish rabbi who wanted his son also to become a Rabbi.   
But Segal showed interest in classical languages and poetry. He   
studied Hebrew, Latin and Greek and Shakespeare, at Princeton, Yale and later  
in Oxford. He was a good poet too, even though people know him only as great  
novelist. He got an award for his Latin erudition and writing poems in Latin  
( an award held previously only by T.S. Eliot). He taught in Oxford, married  
an English girl and settled down in England.   
His later years were full of tragedy. He took to Parkinson's   
disease which restricted his mobility and writing capability.   
He wrote a scholarly work titled The Death of Comedy in the   
year 2000, about the degradation of comedy in the world   
and its people, in the 20th century.   
He was 72 when he died.   
He is survived by his wife and two daughters.   
His famous quote in Love Story: "Loving is not saying sorry."   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear I,   
I like this quote of yours:  _" External world is shadow of what is inside you"_   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Bhagavan Ramana has also said: "You can come to me, when the play is over!"
