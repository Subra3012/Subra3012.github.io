## The magic show in Tiruvananthapuram

Once during King Marthanda Varma's time, in the erstwhile   
state of Travancore, a magician came and wanted the people   
to see his magic show in Tiruvananthapuram.   
The magician showed a war between devas and asuras (gods   
and demons) on the sky. Several thousands swarmed to see   
the magic show. The gods killed many demons. Their heads   
rolled and fell on the ground. The swords, mazes, bows and   
arrows fell scattered all over the ground. Several gods were   
also killed and their head-less torsos fell on the ground. There   
was a flood of blood and limbs.   
The people started crying. They ran hither and thither. Some   
in the milling crowd fell down and broke their limbs, in the   
stampede. The children cried. The women fainted. The king   
himself fell down from his throne. The magician had a roaring   
laughter.   
This is Maya, Maha Maya. Everyone is a prey to It, excepting   
the Creator, the magician of this universe.   
Maya sakti vilasa kalpita maha-vyamoha samharine   
thasmayai guru murtaye sri dakshinamurtaye!   
 \- Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram of Sri Sankara.   
This Maya can create a great delusion, maha-vyamoham.   
Men may lose their limbs, heads and mind too. The   
destroyer of this Maya is Guru, in whose feet, nothing   
of the kind of delusion will overpower you! He is Siva.   
Siva is the killer of Yama, and under Siva's feet, even   
death cannot approach you. How can Maya trouble you?   
My obeisance to that Sri Dakshinamurthy, who is the destroyer   
of maha-vyaamoham, that is made by the Maya Sakti. If   
one wants to stay unperturbed with Mother Unnamulai's   
Maya, one should surrender to the feet of Father Annamalai!   
Arunachala Siva.

## The Old Gramaphone Record  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 07, 2009, 10:41:35 AM

Upto 1970s, we had in India, the gramaphone-record, an   
instrument, on one places a large thin black disc and a moving   
pin will go around the lines, when power is given, and it   
will give out a song. We had one at my home when I was young. The standard  
supplier was the old HMV company, which also brought out discs of M.S.  
Subbalakshmi and other muscians'   
immortal songs. This gramaphone record gave way to audio   
tapes later.   
Sometimes, when the disc is old or when the pin is blunt, the   
same line in the song, will be heard ad nauseum. The pin   
will never move. "Teliyalethu Rama, bhakti margamu... " \-- This   
line will keep on repeating, till Rama comes before you and   
tell you what is bhakti marga.   
What will happen then? Some person should come, slightly move the pin by  
lifting its hand and placing it on the next track-line. Then the music will  
continue and it will end happily.   
The devotees are also like this old gramaphone record. The   
pin is stuck. Same line, repeated. The human life gets stuck   
without further elevation into Brahman. Same thing repeated.   
Bhakti, going to temple, going to office, retiring, conducting   
son or daughter's marriage, sickeness, decay and death.... Again   
a human birth, if one is lucky. It is the human birth which   
makes or mars the purpose. The birds and animals do not   
have these problems. They will do their karma, with occasional   
villainy, but somehow they will jump over to the next level.   
The humans have to do a lot more.   
The gramaphone gets stuck. Then the Person, the Guru comes.   
Slightly lifts and refixes the pin and the music is continued   
and completed. This is Guru krupa, which does away with the   
rebirths and redeaths and samsara cycles....   
Yat sakshat karanabhavenna punaravrutthi bhavam bhodhnidhou.....   
The Realized Person, the Guru, gives the final teaching of   
Tattvamasi and makes to go silent and attain the goal.   
Then there is no cycle of samsara, Satshaktkaram, comes   
with guru's grace, na-punaravrutthi bhavam....   
 \- Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram, Verse 3.   
How to get Guru krupa, his abundant grace? We have to weep   
and cry before him.   
Meekaman illamal makatru alaikalam   
Ahaamal kaathu aruL arunachala.... (Sri AAMM - V. 79)   
Bhagavan Ramana says: O Arunachala, do not make me toss   
like a boat in a tempest, for which there is no   
capable sailor!   
Mookkilan munkattu mukuram ahadhu enaith   
Thookki anaithu aruL arunachala.... (Sri AAMM - V.81)   
O Arunachala, I am already noseless, but do not show me   
a mirror to me; please take me and hug me (on your shoulders).   
Enbolum dheenarai inbura katthu nee   
en-naLum vaazhnthu aruL arunachala.... (Sri AAMM - V. 105)   
O Arunachala, please save the downtroddens like me,   
and you long live and grace.   
Arunachala Siva.

Yes, I agree with you Graham. Today you can't believe "anyone and anything",  
ONLY to checked web sites, anti-virus software solutions, etc.   
There are too many fake anti-virus software, so you must wide open your eyes  
when you surf, download or install anything...
