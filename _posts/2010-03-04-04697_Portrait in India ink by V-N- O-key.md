The Forum rule says: Any guru mentioned on this forum MUST have been dead for at least 50 years.   
I have seen names such as Nisargadatta, who can fall into this category, in  
forum postings.   
I am not sure if it conforms to the forum rule.   
I am not ciriticizing those postings, but I am just asking.

I think the 50 year rule is more of a guideline and is to prevent propaganda  
especially among living gurus. Even Bhagwan could not be mentioned until  
recently if the rule is to be followed strictly!   
In any case, posters cannot be expected to carry a bio of all the gurus to  
check when the 50'th anniversary falls. I am fine with Nisargadatta (or  
anybody else) since it must be a few decades since his death as far as I know.  
Also it should be ok to mention living gurus whenever they make news even for  
all the wrong reasons.   
Just my two paisa.

I asked Graham Boyd the same question. He said it should be followed but for  
some   
stray references. I had, of course, in mind, Kanchi Mahaswami.   
Arunachala Siva.

One Manian Selvam has also made a pencil stroke painting. It has been  
printed   
and published by the Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan. This is the same portrait   
from Welling Bust photograph.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear grhluna,   
Nice poem. A great Yogi or a Jnani does not care for the world.   
He smiles at everyone, take them as they are, without a pre-   
condition and at the same everyone is a straw for him. Even   
the five elements obey him. He does not fear anyone. But he   
loves everyone. Once Alexandar came to his guru Dionysus (Spelling?) and stood  
before him. D was doing his surya namaskar.   
All Aryans pray to the Sun. Alexander bowed to him and told him: Sir, I have defeated many many kings and brought cart load of   
treasures. I want to give you some thing. What do you want?   
Tell me.   
The Guru told him: Please stand away without hiding the Sun from   
my sight and that is all. Go away!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear grhluna,   
What the church-goers do on Sundays? The priest or parish calls them   
all: O Sinners! They all accept the statement, without hesitation.   
Then after the Mass, one by one comes to the priest and confesses his   
sins during the previous week. The priest assures them that he has   
heard them and he forgives them. They go back. And start sinning   
from the time they left the church. This is how the most Westerners   
do their prayers and meditation. Hindus believe that no sin goes un-   
accounted. Only when God's grace showers on you, your sin will   
be washed off. For that, you should constantly meditate and surrender   
to Him. No one, neither the priest nor the gurus like Nityananda have   
power to wash off your sins.   
Arunachala Siva.
