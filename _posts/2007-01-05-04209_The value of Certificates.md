More analogies.   
That one light bulb is 9 and another 90 watt is not the credit of the bulbs --  
their credit is that they are connected and the energy which flows into them  
manifests as light. Also, a light next to you might seem "stronger" than one  
across the street. And, what "use" is a light if you can't find what you are  
looking for?   
Finally, a light bulb advertised on a certificate in your wallet, what use is  
that?

Quote  
It is said that Adi Sankara slept with ladies. Ramana was above sex.  
Dear Soham3, you can advise that guy who made certificates to add this point  
to his system.   
Perhaps, it would be better to replace the question 'who's better?' to the  
question 'who compares?'

In 1999 or 2000 an email was received at the ashram pointing us to a website  
which listed all of the purported jnani's in the world, complete with photos.  
Next to the name was a list of people who had been made into Jnani's by this  
or that teacher.   
I believe the list was 500 names long.   
At the top of the list was Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi and he only produced  
one Jnani according to the list. ... HWL Poonja   
Poonja however was prolific and according to the list (if my memory serves  
correctly) produced over 300 Jnani's, who in turn produced lots more. .. they  
seem to breed like rabbits these days. In the ashram computer room we all fell  
on the floor with laughter when we saw the list.   
The majority of the Lucknow crowd were easily spotted in those days because  
they have the same traits - they boil with anger, are incredibly arrogant and  
generally caused trouble wherever they went in the town, so much so that  
foreigners were refused accommodation in the town area for several years.   
As a footnote, a friend of mine who knew HWL Poonja from the early 1950's,  
travelled to Lucknow and asked Poonja why he was telling people that they were  
self-realised when it was patently clear that they were not. He replied "I  
tell them what they want to hear, then they will go away and leave me alone".  
My friend was stunned by this remark.   
Unfortunately they haven't gone away. They are now busying themselves  
destroying Advaita.   
Whether we like it or not, these false teachers, gurus or whatever it is they  
call themselves, bring nothing but trouble and by their conduct besmirch the  
name of Bhagavan by attaching their name to His.   
The Lucknow crowd have a lot to answer for and none of it good as far as I can  
see.

Add to the list the name of the organization, which has advertised   
in newspapers :- SELF REALIZATION IN TWO HOURS!   
(Perhaps they meant sleep for insomoniacs!)   
Arunachala Siva.

This whole thread seems like building your egos by criticising someone else.  
Feel good do you ?

It makes me feel good reading Graham's comment on Poonja.   
Poonja issued many confirmation letters of enlightment to his followers.   
He appointed an Englishman for his 'official biographer' to promote himself.   
Although these two facts seem to be enough evidence to know   
that he is not the self-realized, not even close,   
even serious seekers seem to have fallen into his trap.   
Poonja is good at fooling followers with beautiful but empty words like a  
sophist.   
Bhagavan's words are short and to the point.   
We must be specially cautious about beautiful words.

This Nithyananda news has been very hot today in south Indian TV channels.   
Don't know about its truth, but such news are hurting the sentiments of  
people. It is a mud splash on the glorious lives of saints.   
This is Kali. What more to say? One more of Fake Gurus   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

I do not know whether this N was issuing certificates to his devotees, after  
the   
"course" and "fees".   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Quote  
This Nithyananda news has been very hot today in south Indian TV channels.   
Don't know about its truth, but such news are hurting the sentiments of  
people. It is a mud splash on the glorious lives of saints.  
Don't know about this swami in particular and whether he spoke strongly  
against sex which has now come back to haunt him. This is the inevitable  
ending for those who emphasize the body in spiritual matters by saying 'do  
this and don't do that'.   
How can a fake person (if he is fake) or TV channels splash mud on saints?  
The real saints only stand out more in contrast to these events.

Dear I,   
That was just an initial reaction. There is no contentions against your point!  
Thats truth! Its just natural, a (Guru) who is said to have over 2.5 lacs +  
followers, is bound to cause anxiety to those who are true and sincere  
aspirants of Truth.   
This person called himself "Paramahamsa" Sanyasin and Paramahamsa is the  
highest order of Sanyasam. He carried with him, on his shoulders, lacs and  
lacs of devotees hopes and faith.   
In a country, which is known as the land of great sages and saints, we are in  
times where such a highly respectable (state) is used for such ignoble  
activities. Interestingly, this person hails from Tiruvannamalai.   
Well, all these are just speculations, no body knows the truth! It is actually  
of no importance or relevance to 'I' as such. But heart feels for those lacs  
of devotees who have laid such respects and belief on a Guru who seems  
dubious. Faith, today is already a rare boon, if Guru's themselves are to be  
doubted, it is a voice of concern.   
Yes, the truth is truth, one should learn who is a true Guru who is a false  
Guru etc... but irrespective of whether a person is true or false, his  
teachings remain untouched, it is the light of knowledge that we should  
venerate as a Guru and not the body of a person which is just inert!   
But yes, Sanathana Dharma has passed toughest test of times over centuries  
after centuries, this is nothing in such big scale of time! Splashing mud on  
saints - just meant that such a venerated (position) (state) of highest  
Sanyasa order such as 'Paramahamsa' is played with.   
Like there is respect for seats. The Seat of a Judge is respect worthy, the  
Seat of President of India which held the gracious presence of personbs like  
Abdul Kalam is respect worthy. When such respect worthy seat is used for  
filthy games, it is, what to say, just feel not nice about it!   
Sad part is that masses, only know a fake after such incidents. Untill then,  
such a person is venerated as a "Jagad Guru"   
Off course, there is actually no mud splash on saints, it is not to be taken  
literally!   
Salutations to Sri Ramana
