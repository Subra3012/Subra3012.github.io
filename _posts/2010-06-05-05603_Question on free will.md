## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Nisargadatta Maharaj says Notion of Doership is Bondage  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 05, 2010, 07:23:57 AM

Q: That we understand, yet constantly we make attempts to live our lives  
instead of just living. Making plans for the future seems to be an inveterate  
habit with us.   
M: Whether you plan or don't, life goes on. But in life itself a little whorl  
arises in the mind, which indulges in fantasies and imagines itself dominating  
and controlling life. **Life itself is desireless.** But the false self wants  
to continue -- pleasantly. Therefore it is always engaged in ensuring one's  
continuity. Life is unafraid and free. As long as you have the idea of  
influencing events, liberation is not for you: **The very notion of doership,  
of being a cause, is bondage.**   
Q: How can we overcome the duality of the doer and the done?   
M: Contemplate life as infinite, undivided, ever present, ever active, until  
you realise yourself as one with it. It is not even very difficult, for you  
will be returning only to your own natural condition.   
Once you realise that all comes from within, that the world in which you live  
has not been projected onto you but by you, your fear comes to an end. Without  
this realisation you identify yourself with the externals, like the body,  
mind, society, nation, humanity, even God or the Absolute. But these are all  
escapes from fear. It is only when you fully accept your responsibility for  
the little world in which you live and watch the process of its creation,  
preservation and destruction, that you may be free from your imaginary  
bondage.   
Q: Why should I imagine myself so wretched?   
M: You do it by habit only. Change your ways of feeling and thinking, take  
stock of them and examine them closely. You are in bondage by inadvertence.  
Attention liberates. You are taking so many things for granted. Begin to  
question. The most obvious things are the most doubtful. Ask yourself such  
questions as: Was I really born?' 'Am I really so-and-so? 'How do I know  
that I exist? 'Who are my parents? 'Have they created me, or have I created  
them?' 'Must I believe all I am told about myself?' Who am I, anyhow?'. You  
have put so much energy into building a prison for yourself. Now spend as much  
on demolishing it. In fact, demolition is easy, for the false dissolves when  
it is discovered. All hangs on the idea 'I am'. Examine it very thoroughly. It  
lies at the root of every trouble. It is a sort of skin that separates you  
from the reality. The real is both within and without the skin, but the skin  
itself is not real. This 'I am' idea was not born with you. You could have  
lived very well without it. It came later due to your self-identification with  
the body. It created an illusion of separation where there was none. It made  
you a stranger in your own world and made the world alien and inimical.  
Without the sense of 'I am' life goes on. There are moments when we are  
without the sense of 'I am'. at peace and happy. With the return of the 'I am'  
trouble starts.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda says we should conquer the world through our spirituality

**THE WORK BEFORE US (Delivered at the Triplicane Literary Society, Madras)   
Volume 3, Lectures from Colombo to Almora  
_The Mohammedan conquest gave us many good things, no doubt; even the lowest  
man in the world can teach something to the highest; at the same time it could  
not bring vigour into the race. Then for good or evil, the English conquest of  
India took place. Of course every conquest is bad, for conquest is an evil,  
foreign government is an evil, no doubt; but even through evil comes good  
sometimes, and the great good of the English conquest is this: England, nay  
the whole of Europe, has to thank Greece for its civilization._   
We cannot do without the world outside India; it was our foolishness that we  
thought we could, and we have paid the penalty by about a thousand years of  
slavery. That we did not go out to compare things with other nations, did not  
mark the workings that have been all around us, has been the one great cause  
of this degradation of the Indian mind. We have paid the penalty; let us do it  
no more. All such foolish ideas that Indians must not go out of India are  
childish. **They must be knocked on the head; the more you go out and travel  
among the nations of the world, the better for you and for your country. If  
you had done that for hundreds of years past, you would not be here today at  
the feet of every nation that wants to rule India.** The first manifest effect  
of life is expansion. You must expand if you want to live.   
**But the gift of India is the gift of religion and philosophy, and wisdom and  
spirituality.**   
Before Buddhism, Vedanta had penetrated into China, into Persia, and the  
Islands of the Eastern Archipelago. Again when the mighty mind of the Greek  
had linked the different parts of the Eastern world together there came Indian  
thought; and **Christianity with all its boasted civilisation is but a  
collection of little bits of Indian thought. Ours is the religion of which  
Buddhism with all its greatness is a rebel child, and of which Christianity is  
a very patchy imitation.** One of these cycles has again arrived. There is the  
tremendous power of England which has linked the different parts of the world  
together.   
The world wants it; without it the world will be destroyed. The whole of the  
Western world is on a volcano which may burst tomorrow, go to pieces tomorrow.  
They have searched every corner of the world and have found no respite. They  
have drunk deep of the cup of pleasure and found it vanity. Now is the time to  
work so that India's spiritual ideas may penetrate deep into the West.  
**Therefore young men of Madras, I specially ask you to remember this. We must  
go out, we must conquer the world through our spirituality and philosophy.  
There is no other alternative, we must do it or die. The only condition of  
national life, of awakened and vigorous national life, is the conquest of the  
world by Indian thought.**   
If the principles are there, the persons will come by the thousands and  
millions. If the principle is safe, persons like Buddha will be born by the  
hundreds and thousands. But if the principle is lost and forgotten and the  
whole of national life tries to cling round a so-called historical person, woe  
unto that religion, danger unto that religion! **Ours is the only religion  
that does not depend on a person or persons; it is based upon principles. At  
the same time there is room for millions of persons.** There is ample ground  
for introducing persons, but each one of them must be an illustration of the  
principles. We must not forget that.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda about Future of India  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 05, 2010, 07:33:02 AM

**THE FUTURE OF INDIA   
Volume 3, Lectures from Colombo to Almora**   
The one common ground that we have is our sacred tradition, our religion. That  
is the only common ground, and upon that we shall have to build. In Europe,  
political ideas form the national unity. **In Asia, religious ideals form the  
national unity.** The unity in religion, therefore, is absolutely necessary as  
the first condition of the future of India. There must be the recognition of  
one religion throughout the length and breadth of this land.   
The attempts of the great Ramanuja and of Chaitanya and of Kabir to raise the  
lower classes of India show that marvellous results were attained during the  
lifetime of those great prophets; yet the later failures have to be explained,  
and cause shown why the effect of their teachings stopped almost within a  
century of the passing away of these great Masters. The secret is here. They  
raised the lower classes; they had all the wish that these should come up, but  
they did not apply their energies to the spreading of the Sanskrit language  
among the masses. **Even the great Buddha made one false step when he stopped  
the Sanskrit language from being studied by the masses. He wanted rapid and  
immediate results, and translated and preached in the language of the day,  
Pâli.**   
In connection with this I want to discuss one question which it has a  
particular bearing with regard to Madras. There is a theory that there was a  
race of mankind in Southern India called Dravidians, entirely differing from  
another race in Northern India called the Aryans, and that the Southern India  
Brâhmins are the only Aryans that came from the North, the other men of  
Southern India belong to an entirely different caste and race to those of  
Southern India Brahmins.   
Now I beg your pardon, Mr. Philologist, this is entirely unfounded. The only  
proof of it is that there is a difference of language between the North and  
the South. I do not see any other difference. We are so many Northern men  
here, and I ask my European friends to pick out the Northern and Southern men  
from this assembly. Where is the difference? A little difference of language.  
But the Brahmins are a race that came here speaking the Sanskrit language!  
Well then, they took up the Dravidian language and forgot their Sanskrit.   
Why should not the other castes have done the same? Why should not all the  
other castes have come one after the other from Northern India, taken up the  
Dravidian language, and so forgotten their own? That is an argument working  
both ways. Do not believe in such silly things. There may have been a  
Dravidian people who vanished from here, and the few who remained lived in  
forests and other places. It is quite possible that the language may have been  
taken up, but all these are Aryans who came from the North. **The whole of  
India is Aryan, nothing else.**   
And the theory that the Shudra caste were all non-Aryans and they were a  
multitude, is equally illogical and equally irrational. It could not have been  
possible in those days that a few Aryans settled and lived there with a  
hundred thousand slaves at their command. These slaves would have eaten them  
up, made "chutney" of them in five minutes. **The only explanation is to be  
found in the Mahâbhârata, which says that in the beginning of the Satya Yuga  
there was one caste, the Brahmins, and then by difference of occupations they  
went on dividing themselves into different castes, and that is the only true  
and rational explanation that has been given. And in the coming Satya Yuga all  
the other castes will have to go back to the same condition.**   
The solution of the caste problem in India, therefore, assumes this form, not  
to degrade the higher castes, not to crush out the Brahmin. **The Brahminhood  
is the ideal of humanity in India, as wonderfully put forward by  
Shankaracharya at the beginning of his commentary on the Gitâ, where he speaks  
about the reason for Krishna 's coming as a preacher for the preservation of  
Brahminhood, of Brahminness.  
**It is the duty of the Brahmin, therefore, to work for the salvation of the  
rest of mankind in India. If he does that, and so long as he does that, he is  
a Brahmin, but he is no Brahmin when he goes about making money.** You on the  
other hand should give help only to the real Brahmin who deserves it; that  
leads to heaven. But sometimes a gift to another person who does not deserve  
it leads to the other place, says our scripture.   
You must be on your guard about that. He only is the Brahmin who has no  
secular employment. Secular employment is not for the Brahmin but for the  
other castes. **To the Brahmins I appeal, that they must work hard to raise  
the Indian people by teaching them what they know, by giving out the culture  
that they have accumulated for centuries.** It is clearly the duty of the  
Brahmins of India to remember what real Brahminhood is. As Manu says, all  
these privileges and honours are given to the Brahmin, because "with him is  
the treasury of virtue".   
But it is one thing to gain an advantage, and another thing to preserve it for  
evil use. Whenever power is used for evil, it becomes diabolical; it must be  
used for good only. So this accumulated culture of ages of which the Brahmin  
has been the trustee, he must now give to the people at large, and it was  
because he did not give it to the people that the Mohammedan invasion was  
possible.   
It was because he did not open this treasury to the people from the beginning,  
that for a thousand years we have been trodden under the heels of every one  
who chose to come to India. It was through that we have become degraded, and  
the first task must be to break open the cells that hide the wonderful  
treasures which our common ancestors accumulated; bring them out and give them  
to everybody and the Brahmin must be the first to do it. There is an old  
superstition in Bengal that if the cobra that bites, sucks out his own poison  
from the patient, the man must survive. Well then, the Brahmin must suck out  
his own poison.   
**To the non-Brahmin castes I say, wait, be not in a hurry.** Do not seize  
every opportunity of fighting the Brahmin, because, as I have shown, you are  
suffering from your own fault. **Who told you to neglect spirituality and  
Sanskrit learning?** What have you been doing all this time? Why have you been  
indifferent? Why do you now fret and fume because somebody else had more  
brains, more energy, more pluck and go, than you? Instead of wasting your  
energies in vain discussions and quarrels in the newspapers, instead of  
fighting and quarrelling in your own homes  which is sinful  use all your  
energies in acquiring the culture which the Brahmin has, and the thing is  
done.   
A far greater work is this sacrifice of yourselves for the benefit of your  
race, for the welfare of humanity. What is in this life? You are Hindus, and  
there is the instinctive belief in you that life is eternal. Sometimes I have  
young men come and talk to me about atheism; **I do not believe a Hindu can  
become an atheist.** He may read European books, and persuade himself he is a  
materialist, but it is only for a time. It is not in your blood.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri Ramakrishna - A real sannyasi, a real devotee who has renounced world

**Sri Ramakrishna - "There is an ocean of difference between a real all-  
renouncing devotee of God and a householder devotee. A real sannyasi, a real  
devotee who has renounced the world, is like a bee. The bee will not light on  
anything but a flower. It will not drink anything but honey. But a devotee  
leading the worldly life is like a fly. The fly sits on a festering sore as  
well as on a sweet-eat. One moment he enjoys a spiritual mood, and the next  
moment he is beside himself with the pleasure of 'woman and gold'.**   
 _" A devotee who has really and truly renounced all for God is like the  
chatak bird. It will drink only the rain-water that falls when the star Svati  
is in the ascendant. It will rather die of thirst than touch any other water,  
though all around there may lie seven oceans and rivers full to the brim with  
water. An all-renouncing devotee will not touch 'woman and gold'. He will not  
keep 'woman and gold' near him lest he should feel attached."_

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda about Vedanta  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 05, 2010, 07:39:06 AM  
---  
**THE VEDANTA IN ALL ITS PHASES   
(Delivered in Calcutta)**   
Whatever system in India does not obey the Upanishads cannot be called  
orthodox, and even the systems of the Jains and the Buddhists have been  
rejected from the soil of India only because they did not bear allegiance to  
the Upanishads. Thus the Vedanta, whether we know it or not, has penetrated  
all the sects in India, and what we call Hinduism, this mighty banyan with its  
immense, almost infinite ramifications, has been throughout interpenetrated by  
the influence of the Vedanta. **Whether we are conscious of it or not, we  
think the Vedanta, we live in the Vedanta, we breathe the Vedanta, and we die  
in the Vedanta, and every Hindu does that.**   
**But the Western people never made a move more, they remained there, they  
failed in the search for the solution of the great problems of life and death  
in the external world, and there they remained, stranded; our forefathers also  
found it impossible, but were bolder in declaring the utter helplessness of  
the senses to find the solution.** Nowhere else was the answer better put than  
in the Upanishad:  "From whence words come back reflected, together with the  
mind";  "There the eye cannot go, nor can speech reach".   
**So far as the Bible and the scriptures of other nations agree with the  
Vedas, they are perfectly good, but when they do not agree, they are no more  
to be accepted. So with the Koran. There are many moral teachings in these,  
and so far as they agree with the Vedas they have the authority of the  
Puranas, but no more. The idea is that the Vedas were never written; the idea  
is, they never came into existence.**   
They believe in a still higher phase of this Personal God, which is personal-  
impersonal. No adjective can illustrate where there is no qualification, and  
the Advaitist would not give Him any qualities except the three Sat-Chit-  
Ananda, Existence, Knowledge, and Bliss Absolute. This is what Shankara did.  
But in the Upanishads themselves you find they penetrate even further, and  
say, nothing can be predicated of it except Neti, Neti, **" Not this, Not  
this".**   
 **Renunciation, that is the flag, the banner of India, floating over the  
world, the one undying thought which India sends again and again as a warning  
to dying races, as a warning to all tyranny, as a warning to wickedness in the  
world.** Ay, Hindus, let not your hold of that banner go. Hold it aloft. Even  
if you are weak and cannot renounce, do not lower the ideal. Say, "I am weak  
and cannot renounce the world", but do not try to be hypocrites, torturing  
texts, and making specious arguments, and trying to throw dust in the eyes of  
people who are ignorant.   
The land of Buddha, the land of Ramanuja, of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, the land  
of renunciation, the land where, from the days of yore, Karma Kanda was  
preached against, and even today there are hundreds who have given up  
everything, and become Jivanmuktas  ay, will that land give up its ideals?  
Certainly not. **There may be people whose brains have become turned by the  
Western luxurious ideals; there may be thousands and hundreds of thousands who  
have drunk deep of enjoyment, this curse of the West  the senses  the curse  
of the world; yet for all that, there will be other thousands in this  
motherland of mine to whom religion will ever be a reality, and who will be  
ever ready to give up without counting the cost, if need be.**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda says to be proud to be a hindu

THE COMMON BASES OF HINDUISM   
Volume 3, Lectures from Colombo to Almora   
Let them talk of India's regeneration as they like. Let me tell you as one who  
has been working  at least trying to work  all his life, that there is no  
regeneration for India until you be spiritual. Not only so, but upon it  
depends the welfare of the whole world. **For I must tell you frankly that the  
very foundations of Western civilisation have been shaken to their base.**   
The mightiest buildings, if built upon the loose sand foundations of  
materialism, must come to grief one day, must totter to their destruction some  
day. The history of the world is our witness. Nation after nation has arisen  
and based its greatness upon materialism, declaring man was all matter. Ay, in  
Western language, a man gives up the ghost, but in our language a man gives up  
his body. **The Western man is a body first, and then he has a soul; with us a  
man is a soul and spirit, and he has a body. Therein lies a world of  
difference.**   
Do not be in a hurry, do not go out to imitate anybody else. This is another  
great lesson we have to remember; imitation is not civilisation. I may deck  
myself out in a Raja's dress, but will that make me a Raja? An ass in a lion's  
skin never makes a lion. Imitation, cowardly imitation, never makes for  
progress. It is verily the sign of awful degradation in a man. Ay, when a man  
has begun to hate himself, then the last blow has come.   
When a man has begun to be ashamed of his ancestors, the end has come. Here am  
I, one of the least of the Hindu race, yet proud of my race, proud of my  
ancestors. I am proud to call myself a Hindu, I am proud that I am one of your  
unworthy servants. I am proud that I am a countryman of yours, you the  
descendants of the sages, you the descendants of the most glorious Rishis the  
world ever saw. **Therefore have faith in yourselves, be proud of your  
ancestors, instead of being ashamed of them.** And do not imitate, do not  
imitate! Whenever you are under the thumb of others, you lose your own  
independence. If you are working, even in spiritual things, at the dictation  
of others, slowly you lose all faculty, even of thought. Bring out through  
your own exertions what you have, but do not imitate, yet take what is good  
from others.   
We have to learn from others. You put the seed in the ground, and give it  
plenty of earth, and air, and water to feed upon; when the seed grows into the  
plant and into a gigantic tree, does it become the earth, does it become the  
air, or does it become the water? It becomes the mighty plant, the mighty  
tree, after its own nature, having absorbed everything that was given to it.  
Let that be your position. **We have indeed many things to learn from others,  
yea, that man who refuses to learn is already dead.**   
Declares our Manu: -   
"Take the jewel of a woman for your wife, though she be of inferior descent.  
Learn supreme knowledge with service even from the man of low birth; and even  
from the Chandâla, learn by serving him the way to salvation." **Learn  
everything that is good from others, but bring it in, and in your own way  
absorb it; do not become others.Do not be dragged away out of this Indian  
life; do not for a moment think that it would be better for India if all the  
Indians dressed, ate, and behaved like another race.**   
Religion in India must be made as free and as easy of access as is God's air.

 **Source** : http://www.hindupedia.com/en/Sri_Dakshinamurthy_Stotram   
Translated by P.R.Ramachander   
Adhi Sankara has written very many great Stotras (prayers) but here is a  
unique prayer, which is not only a prayer but the summary of all the  
philosophy that he has taught. Even during his time, this stotra was difficult  
to comprehend and it became necessary for one of his disciples,  
Sureshwaracharya to write a commentary called Manasollasa to this stotra.  
There are large number of books and commentaries on this commentary itself.   
Mouna Vyakhya prakatitha, para,   
Brahma thathwam yuvanam,   
Varshishtha anthevasad rishiganai,   
Ravrutham brahma nishtai,   
Acharyendram kara kalihtha chin,   
Mudram ananda roopam,   
Swathmaramam mudhitha vadanam,   
Dakshinamurthim eede.   
I praise and salute that Dakshinamrthy,   
Who faces the south,   
Who explains the true nature of the supreme Brahman,   
Through his state of silence,   
Who is young in looks,   
Who is surrounded by disciples who are old Sages,   
Whose minds are fixed on Brahman,   
Who is the greatest of teachers,   
Who shows the Chinmudhra by his hand,   
Who is personification of happiness,   
Who is in the state of extreme joy within himself,   
And who has a smiling face.   
 **Note** : **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Dumb people should have also  
have become gurus if by silence only doubts get eradicated. So it means we  
need to listen carefully in silent mind without having any other thoughts and  
do sravanam,mananam and nidhidyasanam by concentration.** As time is dependent  
on him so it means he looks young.   
Sri Dakshinamurthy Stotram was first told to Sanaka,Sanatana,  
Sanandana,Sanatkumara who are the sons of Lord Brahma By Lord  
shiva(Dakshinamurthy).Adi Guru from which gnana started by  
Dakshinamurthy(Siva). **Please note that Gnana is never created and gnana is  
eternal.** Example: Even before newton discovered our earth is having  
gravitational force and only newton discovered it and not invented.   
In Hand as known thumb finger is very important and base and other four  
fingers have no power without thumb finger.   
 **In our hand the middle,ring and little fingers represent walking,dream,deep  
sleep states. 4th finger(Index Finger) i.e pointing finger represents  
ego(jiva).When we obverse jiva always tries to be close with the other 3  
fingers but not with thumb finger.   
Chinmudra means hand gesture in which the first finger is kept at the root of  
the thumb, the last three fingers are unfolded which means jiva mixes with  
thumb finger which is paramatma as thumb finger is required for any operation  
with hand.**   
Below article gives more information about Chin Mudra.   
http://www.hathayoga.co.za/mudras.htm   
 **Chin Mudra**   
 **This gesture symbolises the connected nature of human consciousness. The  
circle formed by the index finger and thumb represents the true goal of yoga  
â the merging of the individual soul with the universal soul, or the soul of  
God. The nail of the index finger is placed into the first joint of the  
thumb.** The last three fingers always face down towards the earth in this  
mudra. It is a gesture of receiving. When the finger touches the thumb a  
circuit is produced which allows the energy that would normally dissipate into  
the environment to travel back into the body, and up to the brain.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Vedanta is for one who thinks he is bound and  
no age,sex factors come into consideration.   
In dreams even though there is no external light,sun,moon and though we close  
our eyes we are still seeing our dream by our own light(chaitanyam).We are not  
the body also we are only observer of the body but not the body as we observe  
our body growing old etc...

Similar to the image of a town as seen in the mirror,   
When one sees the image of the world within him,   
 **The world appears as if it is outside.   
It is similar to his seeing due to illusion,   
During the state of sleep,   
That the one real fact appears as many different truths,   
And he realizes,when he wakes up and sees the reality,   
That he is really the one and only one soul.   
Salutation to the God facing the south,   
Who is the greatest teacher.**   
The above stanza tells us that the world which is outside us is same as our  
soul but we see them as different entities due to the veil of ignorance. As  
soon as we wake up, we realize that the dream is false and even while seeing  
our image in the mirror, we know that we are not seeing us in the mirror but  
our image. When we get knowledge from the guru we are in the wakeful state  
without the veil of ignorance.   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Seeing two different things is not  
Duality(Dvaitam) but not having bhava that all beings are one and the same is  
Duality(Dvaitam).Here in this stanza sleep mentioned is dreams.In dreams we  
also dream relations,sorrows etc.If many pots are there to know all are made  
with mud then it is advaita else if we differentiate then it is dvaita.   
As known Ramana Maharshi said many times that walking state and dream state  
are same.   
 **As sundara chaitanya swami says,in dreams we create the world(drishti-  
srishti vada) but in waking state world is already created and we see the  
world.(srishti-drishti vada).everyone dreams are different but waking state is  
same to everyone.**   
 **But our mind is the same in dreams and waking states which is important.**  
So consciousness is our real nature.Knower,known and knowledge i.e subject and  
object are all false.   
Also our body and mind and five senses are also objects which is important as  
we are knowing about changes in our body and five senses. **As in deep sleep  
we are alive though there is no mind,body,world.**   
So world is in us rather than we in the world.   
Fore more details i suggest to read Adi Shankara's Drik Drusya Vivekam.

Like the germ inside the seed is its part,   
But becomes different after development   
The many places and time which are before us,   
Are drawn by illusion in the board of life in a peculiar manner,   
By a great savant or an expert Siddha,   
Who can create them as per their will,   
Salutation to the God facing the south,   
Who is the greatest teacher.   
When the net of illusion is lifted and when we reach the stage of  
manifestation, we would find that what we think as different is but one and  
the same.   
 **Note** : **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says with Dakshinamurthy Stotram we  
are clear that time and space are not real and hence we cannot accept creation  
has been done in 7 or 6 or N number of days and that god created water on  
first day etc etc..Also it seems it was written in that book that god was not  
clear which he has created in the first 3 days and hence he was ensuring  
again.6th day it seems that god created sun.It is false theory as without sun  
if do we know that 5 days are passed? These theories and those books and  
followers are blind and wrong as known time and space are not real.Person who  
are intelligent will not believe in these false theroies.Also it seems that it  
was written that people who don 't believe will go to hell which is again  
false propaganda.**   
Because though all religions accept god is creator but no one clearly tells  
what is the material with which he created no one knows. if we accept god  
created universe with some material like plastic then we need to accept  
plastic are there before only.   
 _But if we think who created our dreams so we are clear that only our mind is  
responsible for creation of dreams and waking states but we cannot accept  
srishti-drishti vada._   
Also we cannot accept that god is changing and he has been changed to world  
etc.Because we say it is only superimposition we are seeing like rope and  
snake.So only brahman only exists and nothing exists like explained above  
already chinmudra in our hand where thumb finger is seperate and not attached  
to any states.   
Even Einstein theory also says that time and space are relative.

He who exists as the real light of truth,   
And shines in the false world of appearance,   
And He who teaches disciples the great saying,   
âThou art thatâ after realizing its import,   
Gets away from this cycle of life and death.   
Salutation to the God facing the south,   
Who is the greatest teacher.   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says âThou art thatâ is the brahmastram  
and ultimate weapon.In sanskrit it means "Tat Tvam Asi". In advaita it means  
absolute equality of 'tat', the Ultimate Reality, Brahman, and 'tvam', the  
individual self, jiva.

 **Like the light emanating from a lamp,   
Kept in a pot(kunda) with many holes,   
Goes out in all directions,   
Similarly In the person in whom the wisdom goes out   
Through the openings of ear, eye, mouth and thought,   
And when that person realizes that âI know myselfâ,   
This whole universe shines after Him alone,   
Who shines in the consciousness as the knower.   
Salutation to the God facing the south,   
Who is the greatest teacher.   
Our body prevents us from seeing the truth(the light from outside) that we are  
the Brahman and lets out light though the sensory organs and makes us deceive  
ourselves by feeling that we are happy.** This simile of a pot with holes for  
the body occurs in many places in Indian philosophy.   
 **Note** : Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says who speaks spritiual technical  
terms like karma etc(edo naa karma sir ani aneevallu) without knowing meaning  
also is fine and we should never blame them.   
 **He blamed people who says all religions are same and he says people who  
tells these are one who donot know basics in religion.But he says everyone  
should live together peacefully.**

Those great philosophers, who think that,   
The body, the soul and the fickle intellect,   
The concept of emptiness and all other nothingness,   
Are nothing but themselves,   
Are similar to the women children, blind and the ignorant.   
It is only He who can destroy, this veil of ignorance,   
And wake us up from this state of deceit.   
Salutation to the God facing the south,   
Who is the greatest teacher.   
 **This is a sample of the approach of negation in identifying the truth about  
the concept of self. Senses, the body etc cannot be the absolute truth as they  
are transient.**   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami strictly condemns **Carvaka** school of  
thought.He questions that if body is really atma why does the dead body does  
not speak and why cannot we stop our death?   
In budhdism one sect called "kshanikha vignana vadam" means atma is only  
temporary means if i see a flower then i get flower knowledge and later once  
we forget flower then knowledge is given and so is atma.   
In budhdism another sect called "sunyavadam" where they believe that atma is  
sunyam like deep sleep where nothing remains.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya swami condenms all sects of buddhism though he tells  
that buddhism is better when compared to other religions.

Yaa prathyabignayathe,   
Thasmai sri guru murthaye nama idham,   
Sree dakshinamurthaye., 7   
Similar to the Sun when being masked by the serpent Rahu,   
Knows that it was existing, once the eclipse is over   
That man whose senses are suppressed   
When he is asleep,   
Because of the veil of illusion,   
Realizes that he was in the state of sleep,   
When he wakes up.   
Salutation to the God facing the south,   
Who is the greatest teacher.   
 **Similar the sun existing even when there is eclipse, we exist when we are  
sleeping. This is denial of the Buddhist theory that, when we are asleep there  
is nothingness.   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says to say we slept happily in deep sleep  
means we should have experienced it to say we slept happily so sunyam concept  
of Buddhist is denied completely.Therefore we are sat-chit-ananda as i am  
existing in all threee states i.e dream,deep sleep,waking state.Therefore i am  
witness of the 3 states.**   
 **Note : Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says experience is not really required  
and only jnana is required which helps to eradicate ignorance.   
Our life is always with combination of questions and answers only.In our  
childhood our parents ask various questions like they ask us to recognise who  
is father,mother,pen...etc etc..   
Later we start asking questions like mother,where did father go outside? amma  
is food ready? or husband asks wife what is lunch today etc etc.**   
All our experiences are difference like we have diff experience when we lose  
our wealth and our experience is diff when we gain more health and our  
experience is diff when we fail in exams.But all these experiences are  
experienced by us.

 **Salutations to him who shines and exhibits,

That he exists within the humans as self,   
Forever and non changing,   
Even during the changing states of childhood, youth and old age   
And even during the states of sleep, dream and wakefulness.   
Salutation to the God facing the south,   
Who is the greatest teacher.**   
The truth as represented by the concept of Brahman, exists always.   
 **In dreams we have only bhokta and no kartha because it is only mind who  
dreams.**   
 **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says one of the big scripture in the world is  
told in dreams by god.**   
Brahmins are called Shastri because he is the knower of Shastras.

And so the man is confused by illusion,   
And believes in these differences,   
During the times of dream and wakefulness.**   
Salutation to the God facing the south,   
Who is the greatest teacher.   
The ignorance of the truth because of the veil of ignorance Maya is  
reemphasized.

To the sake of which supreme Brahman,   
The universe is shining as self,   
Which is Movable and immovable, with its aspects?   
Of water, fire, air, space,   
The sun, moon and the individual soul,   
And also to those who examine the truth behind,   
The meaning of this universe and find,

Meditating which and singing which,   
One would attain the state of the godliness,   
And the great state of self realization,   
And also you would get the eight powers of occult,   
Without any problems in between.   
Appendix   
The following three stanzas as well as the first stanza are chanted after the  
main stotra:-   
Chitram Vata tharor mole vruddha,   
Sishya, Guror Yuva,   
Gurostu mounam vykhyanam,   
Sishyasthu china samsaya   
It is strange to see,   
The very old disciples,   
And the very young teacher,   
Who sit under a banyan tree,   
With the teacher always observing silence,   
And the students getting all the doubts cleared.   
Om nama pranavarthaya,   
Suddha jnanaika moorthaye nama,   
Nirmalaya prasanthaya,   
Sri Dakshinamurthaye nama.   
Salutations to that Dakshinamurthy,   
Who is the meaning of the pranava, âomâ,   
Who is the personification of unalloyed wisdom,   
Who is crystal clear in his thought,   
And who is the epitome of peace.   
Gurave sara lokaanam,   
Bishaje bhava roginaam,   
Nidhaye sarva vidhyanam,   
Sri Dakshinamurthaye nama.   
Salutations to that Dakshinamurthy,   
Who is the teacher of the entire world,   
Who is the doctor to those,   
Afflicted by the disease of birth and death,   
And who is the treasure hose of all knowledge.

## Advaita Makaranda By Sri Laksmidhara Kavi  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: June 05, 2010, 11:26:55 AM  
---  
Please listen to **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami** Gari Pravachanam in telugu.   
http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=search_playlists&search_query=AdvaitaMakarandam&uni=1   
1\. Salutations to Lord Krishna, who is infinite bliss, whose form is  
auspicious to the whole universe, and who by a mere beam of His glance, dries  
up the ocean of delusion of those who surrender to Him.   
 **2\. Ever existent and luminous am I; never am I not dear to myself.  
Therefore, it is established that Brahman, of the nature of Existence-  
Consciousness-Bliss, alone am I.**   
 **Note** : Please read below article which tells that it is for the sake of self we love  
god,husband,wife,money,paruvu(prestige)....   
Even if money... are gone but still our love for ourself is not gone.   
http://prashantaboutindia.blogspot.com/2009/07/it-is-for-sake-of-self-atman-  
we-love.html   
Above points are also confirmed by Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami in Advaita  
Makarandam Volume3 Part4 video.   
3\. In Me, the Space of Consciousness, alone does the whole world - like the  
castle-in-the-air - arise.How am I, therefore, not Brahman, the All-knower and  
the Cause of all?   
 **Note** : **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Sarvagnaha is not to know all  
things in the world like how much population...etc but it is only to know the  
adhara(base) of the thing. Ex: if i know mud is base for pot then all kinds of  
pot knowledge are known to me.**   
Because everything in the world comes from me i am Sarvagnaha.   
**" castle-in-the-air" means like "clouds in the air" looks like a town or  
some animal shape.... Sometimes in our childhood we tend to believe like that  
the shape of the clouds like some animal,town. ..   
Scriptures tells us to enquire the relationship between god and world but it  
does not tell that god created the world and etc etc... it is like  
relationship between pot and mud. mud is god and pot is world. So pot is  
neither true not false but it is dependent on mud. because pot can break any  
moment and finally only mud is remaining.   
Mithya means it is dependent on other thing like pot which is dependent on  
mud.   
Ideally there is no relation between pot and mud as ideally pot is nothing but  
mud and there are no 2 entities to have relationship.Similarly between god and  
world.   
As per bhagavad gita lord krishna tells everyone/everything is in him and not  
otherwise.waves belong to ganges but not otherwise.**   
 **4\. By reasons of continuous memory (as 'I', 'I'), and partlessness, and  
even for any other reason, (such as) loss of support - because I am not  
dependent on any - can my destruction be brought about.  
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says partlessness is the theory suggested in  
Buddhism but not supported by sanatana Dharma.Acc to that theory atma will be  
created and destroyed once we see human,dog...   
5\. The element of space cannot be dried, burnt, wet, or cut, even by equally  
real elements like wind, fire, water, and weapons respectively. How then can  
I, the pure Consciousness, be destroyed by things imagined in (superimposed  
upon) Me?   
6\. The inert universe can never be experienced without the proximity of  
Consciousness. I, the Consciousness, therefore, am present everywhere.   
 **Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says**   
The world we see, being seen by the eye, is drisya (object);the eye which sees  
it is drik (subject). But the eye, being perceived by the mind is drisya  
(object) and the mind which sees it is drik (subject). The mind, with its  
thoughts perceived by the Self, is drisya (object) and the Self is drik  
(subject). **We are self(witness) because we are witnessing various thoughts  
perceived by the mind and hence we are not mind also but only witness.**   
 **7\. Existence of the world cannot be without its experience. Without  
Consciousness the inert world cannot be experienced. The association of the  
inert with Consciousness also cannot be without superimposition. Therefore, I  
(the Consciousness) am one without a second.**   
 **Note** : My Commentary: inert means Having only a limited ability to react chemically.Here author  
tells superimposition because to see the world we need to use senses + mind  
which is again drusya and not drik.Like a rope and a snake superimposition can  
happen when viewing the world as we tend to get attached with our senses and  
mind but instead we are only Consciousness.   
As Guru ramana says Existence or consciousness is the only reality.  
Consciousness plus waking, we call waking.Consciousness plus sleep, we call  
sleep. Consciousness plus dream, we call dream.   
Consciousness is the screen on which all the pictures come and go. The screen  
is real, the pictures are mere shadows on it.   
8\. I am not the body, nor the sense-organs, nor the vital airs, nor the mind  
nor the intellect, because these are all objects embraced by the 'my-thought',  
or (like) the sport of 'this-thought'.   
Note: I am not body because we know clearly that we are dying so we are  
witness.I am not the mind/intellect because in deep sleep i exist even though  
there is no mind/intellect.   
 **9\. I am the witness, all-pervading and dear, and never the ego, which has  
the misfortune of modifications, limitations and afflictions.   
10\. Sorrow and other defects are not experienced when the ego goes to sleep.  
Therefore, the circuit of mundane existence belongs to the ego alone which  
constantly undergoes transmigration, etc., and not to Me who is the witness of  
the ego.**   
Note:Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Witness cannot have any qualities of the  
drusyam. For Example: if i see a pot i will not have qualities of the pot.   
 **11\. One who sleeps does not know sleep. One that sleeps not (the atman),  
dream and waking cannot be. Therefore, I am the witness of the dream, waking  
and sleep states; and I do not have these conditions.   
12\. Cessation of all objective knowledge is deep sleep, and the rise of it is  
dream and waking. How can these three belong to Me, who is their witness, and  
ever of the nature of knowledge?**   
13\. Being the knower of those that have the six modifications would in no way  
be possible to imagine.   
 **14\. If a thing is born and disappears every moment, taking different forms  
successively, then how can such a changing thing remember the changes?**   
Note: Note:Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says body is changing automatically without  
our interference depending on the input food we give.like becoming old,fat  
etc.Our body does not know that it is getting modified.Also another example is  
bud changing to flower with the input of water and then slowly gives  
fruits....   
My Commentary: clearly says that we are the witness of all our thoughts.We are  
self(witness) because we are witnessing various thoughts perceived by the mind  
and hence we are not mind also but only witness.   
Please read this article for more clarity.  
http://prashantaboutindia.blogspot.com/2010/03/drik-drishya-vivekam-explains-  
how-is.html   
15\. And no one can ever see one's own birth or death. The birth is the final  
moment of prior non-existence, and the death is the first moment of later  
absence, respectively.   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says No one can see his own birth or death  
but can see only other's birth and death.   
16\. The statements like ' I do not know ' are illumined on the basis of this  
Consciousness. How can such self-illumined Self be ever touched by the  
ignorance?   
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says We have intelligence to know that we  
donot know something.But where is this ignorance?   
17\. Even then, this inexplicable something (ignorance) does appear as long as  
one lives without discrimination. It is like the fog in the space of  
Consciousness that lasts till the rise of the sun of knowledge, born of  
discrimination.   
18\. In this long dream consisting of this universe, projected out of the  
great sleep called ignorance of the Self, do all these illusions like heaven,  
liberation, etc., arise.   
Note: Sastras are required to help us to come out from ignorance.Also guru is  
like a lion who makes elephant to wake from dream.   
19\. This division as the inert things (worlds) and the sentient beings  
(jivas) is imagined in Me, the pure Consciousness, like the moving and the  
stationary things in a painting upon a portion of the wall.   
 **20\. Even my witnesshood is not absolute, but is influenced with reference  
to the thoughts appearing in the mind. This witnesshood is only an assumption  
in the waveless ocean-of-Consciousness (that I am).**   
Note: We are witness of our thoughts.Suppose If we are witness then we need to  
accept that there will be object as for witness we need to accept duality but  
even this is not true as there is only one self.Waves are temporary but ocean  
is permanent.   
Please read below article to have more idea.   
http://prashantaboutindia.blogspot.com/2010/04/ramana-maharshi-disciple-says-  
it-is.html   
21\. There cannot be any loss to me, the ocean of Immortality, from the rise  
of unreal waves, nor can the false evening clouds color me, the mountain of  
pure crystal.   
 **22\. Like spaceness is the nature of space, existence is my very 'nature',  
and not one of my 'qualities'. Existence is not considered as a classifiable  
quality because there is no existence apart from Me.**   
 **Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Here Laksmidhara Kavi clearly tells  
that theory of vishitadvaita is false.Because acc to vishitadvaita it tells  
our existence if a quality.Suppose in a garden there are only rose flowers  
then if we want a flower we will tell we want one flower but we will not tell  
we want rose flower as all are rose flowers only.Truth is only one and the  
word vishitadvaita is itself false as advaita means one without second and  
hence vishitadvaita word is wrong. Quality means which is temporary and not  
absolute.Because if we say ramu is good boy it means that he is good boy in  
that context but his quality can change later.**   
23\. **Consciousness is my nature only and not my quality. If it is a quality,  
then, the atman is knowable by it. In that case it becomes not-Self.** If the  
atman is not knowable, it would be non-existent.   
Readers are requested to read below article.   
http://prashantaboutindia.blogspot.com/2010/04/ramana-maharshi-says.html   
24. **Bliss is myself and not different.** If it is different, it is not bliss at all. For, it would not be dear if it is not for me, and if it is for me, it is not dear by itself.   
Note: If bliss is different from us then it is not bliss because what ever  
comes also goes.so bliss is our nature.How can bliss comes from non-self which  
is coming from other objects? If really happiness is coming from outside then  
shop owners should keep "happiness sold here" but it is not the case as we all  
know.More over not everyone will like the same object so bliss is not  
contained in object.Example: My wife(sneha) used to like chocolates previously  
but now she has stopped liking chocolates which means bliss is not in  
chocolates.   
So it is for the sake of the self we like anyone in this world. we like our  
wife because she is helpful to us and she behaves in a way we get bliss.

we-love.html   
25\. One reality cannot be of many natures ever. Therefore, discarding the  
differences that belong to the world, undivided do I exist.   
26\. That great light of Consciousness of one essence am I, indicated by the  
words of the shruti as "That Thou Art", and which is the pure One, eliminating  
the conditioning of remoteness and limitations.   
 **27\. That Effulgent Consciousness am I, which is Self-established, all-  
full, without beginning and end, and in which the illusory ideas of the  
worlds, the individual, the disciple, the teacher and God, are all extinct.**   
Note: Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says it is wrong to tell that we are  
all together one but actually there is only one but we assume we are all  
different individuals.   
28\. May this nectar of non-dual Brahman, prepared by poet Lakshmidhara's  
verses, which are like autumnal lotuses, be joyfully drunk by all wise men who  
are like bees.

## Advaita Makaranda By Sri Laksmidhara Kavi  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: June 05, 2010, 11:26:55 AM  
---  
Please listen to **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami** Gari Pravachanam in telugu.   
http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=search_playlists&search_query=AdvaitaMakarandam&uni=1   
1\. Salutations to Lord Krishna, who is infinite bliss, whose form is  
auspicious to the whole universe, and who by a mere beam of His glance, dries  
up the ocean of delusion of those who surrender to Him.   
 **2\. Ever existent and luminous am I; never am I not dear to myself.  
Therefore, it is established that Brahman, of the nature of Existence-  
Consciousness-Bliss, alone am I.**   
 **Note** : Please read below article which tells that it is for the sake of self we love  
god,husband,wife,money,paruvu(prestige)....   
Even if money... are gone but still our love for ourself is not gone.   
http://prashantaboutindia.blogspot.com/2009/07/it-is-for-sake-of-self-atman-  
we-love.html   
Above points are also confirmed by Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami in Advaita  
Makarandam Volume3 Part4 video.   
3\. In Me, the Space of Consciousness, alone does the whole world - like the  
castle-in-the-air - arise.How am I, therefore, not Brahman, the All-knower and  
the Cause of all?   
 **Note** : **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Sarvagnaha is not to know all  
things in the world like how much population...etc but it is only to know the  
adhara(base) of the thing. Ex: if i know mud is base for pot then all kinds of  
pot knowledge are known to me.**   
Because everything in the world comes from me i am Sarvagnaha.   
**" castle-in-the-air" means like "clouds in the air" looks like a town or  
some animal shape.... Sometimes in our childhood we tend to believe like that  
the shape of the clouds like some animal,town. ..   
Scriptures tells us to enquire the relationship between god and world but it  
does not tell that god created the world and etc etc... it is like  
relationship between pot and mud. mud is god and pot is world. So pot is  
neither true not false but it is dependent on mud. because pot can break any  
moment and finally only mud is remaining.   
Mithya means it is dependent on other thing like pot which is dependent on  
mud.   
Ideally there is no relation between pot and mud as ideally pot is nothing but  
mud and there are no 2 entities to have relationship.Similarly between god and  
world.   
As per bhagavad gita lord krishna tells everyone/everything is in him and not  
otherwise.waves belong to ganges but not otherwise.**   
 **4\. By reasons of continuous memory (as 'I', 'I'), and partlessness, and  
even for any other reason, (such as) loss of support - because I am not  
dependent on any - can my destruction be brought about.  
Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says partlessness is the theory suggested in  
Buddhism but not supported by sanatana Dharma.Acc to that theory atma will be  
created and destroyed once we see human,dog...   
5\. The element of space cannot be dried, burnt, wet, or cut, even by equally  
real elements like wind, fire, water, and weapons respectively. How then can  
I, the pure Consciousness, be destroyed by things imagined in (superimposed  
upon) Me?   
6\. The inert universe can never be experienced without the proximity of  
Consciousness. I, the Consciousness, therefore, am present everywhere.   
 **Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says**   
The world we see, being seen by the eye, is drisya (object);the eye which sees  
it is drik (subject). But the eye, being perceived by the mind is drisya  
(object) and the mind which sees it is drik (subject). The mind, with its  
thoughts perceived by the Self, is drisya (object) and the Self is drik  
(subject). **We are self(witness) because we are witnessing various thoughts  
perceived by the mind and hence we are not mind also but only witness.**   
 **7\. Existence of the world cannot be without its experience. Without  
Consciousness the inert world cannot be experienced. The association of the  
inert with Consciousness also cannot be without superimposition. Therefore, I  
(the Consciousness) am one without a second.**   
 **Note** : My Commentary: inert means Having only a limited ability to react chemically.Here author  
tells superimposition because to see the world we need to use senses + mind  
which is again drusya and not drik.Like a rope and a snake superimposition can  
happen when viewing the world as we tend to get attached with our senses and  
mind but instead we are only Consciousness.   
As Guru ramana says Existence or consciousness is the only reality.  
Consciousness plus waking, we call waking.Consciousness plus sleep, we call  
sleep. Consciousness plus dream, we call dream.   
Consciousness is the screen on which all the pictures come and go. The screen  
is real, the pictures are mere shadows on it.   
8\. I am not the body, nor the sense-organs, nor the vital airs, nor the mind  
nor the intellect, because these are all objects embraced by the 'my-thought',  
or (like) the sport of 'this-thought'.   
Note: I am not body because we know clearly that we are dying so we are  
witness.I am not the mind/intellect because in deep sleep i exist even though  
there is no mind/intellect.   
 **9\. I am the witness, all-pervading and dear, and never the ego, which has  
the misfortune of modifications, limitations and afflictions.   
10\. Sorrow and other defects are not experienced when the ego goes to sleep.  
Therefore, the circuit of mundane existence belongs to the ego alone which  
constantly undergoes transmigration, etc., and not to Me who is the witness of  
the ego.**   
Note:Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Witness cannot have any qualities of the  
drusyam. For Example: if i see a pot i will not have qualities of the pot.   
 **11\. One who sleeps does not know sleep. One that sleeps not (the atman),  
dream and waking cannot be. Therefore, I am the witness of the dream, waking  
and sleep states; and I do not have these conditions.   
12\. Cessation of all objective knowledge is deep sleep, and the rise of it is  
dream and waking. How can these three belong to Me, who is their witness, and  
ever of the nature of knowledge?**   
13\. Being the knower of those that have the six modifications would in no way  
be possible to imagine.   
 **14\. If a thing is born and disappears every moment, taking different forms  
successively, then how can such a changing thing remember the changes?**   
Note: Note:Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says body is changing automatically without  
our interference depending on the input food we give.like becoming old,fat  
etc.Our body does not know that it is getting modified.Also another example is  
bud changing to flower with the input of water and then slowly gives

## Question on free will  
Author: kde                 Date: June 05, 2010, 07:30:07 PM  
---  
I have been thinking lately about this, and started to doubt we have any free  
will at all.   
It seems to me we ether have total free will or none at all. The later seems  
most likely to me. Though the illusion of free will is present.   
Can someone say what did Ramana think regarding free will?

Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 06, 2010, 05:33:26 AM

Dear kde,   
There is NO FREE WILL at all for anyone. Everything is predestined.   
He said Devaraja Mudaliar, when the latter asked Him about it: Everything is predestined.   
Mudaliar: Even my putting the hand fan on the floor or getting it   
again for some breeze?   
Bhagavan: Yes.   
Mudaliar: Even my intention to take a cup of water....?   
Bhagavan: Yes. Nothing happens without the destiny. There   
is no free will. I came away from my family to T'malai, so that   
I could be free. But here, there is a bigger family around me.   
Where is the free will?   
But a self realized Jnani does not care about free will or destiny.   
For him, both are not there. Because, he has seen the source of   
both, that is, the Self. See ULLadu Narpadu, Verse 19. So long   
as you do not use discrimination of real and unreal and attain the   
Reality, the free will-destiny discussions will go on.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian.R,   
Thanks for your reply. I was hoping someone would argue in favor of freewill.  
It's something I will have to think about more.   
On the other hand, Ramana seems very clear on the subject. If everything is  
decided before birth, then even our every thought is predestined. It would  
seem that surrender is the only course to take. Even that would be  
predestined.   
It's believable but hard to accept.   
Regards

Dear kde,   
Yes. There are several siddha (yogic) poets who have sung in their   
songs about destiny and total surrender to Siva. One   
siddha saint had said: "In sleep, I inhale, and if that air does not come  
back to my nostril again, after exhalation, O Siva, who is there but You, for  
me?"   
One another siddha saint had sung: He took his hearty meals from   
his wife's hands. He put of the lights and copulated with her joyously.  
Then, "He said, there is some pain on my left chest...."   
He was not there to speak any more! O Siva, what can I do in   
life, but to seek your grace?   
The impermanence of life - if one truly understands, he will surrender to God  
totally.   
Arunachala Siva.

Advaita proclaims we all are ever free. But when we do not understand then the  
question arises whether I got free will or not. Jnanis never bother about free  
will.

So the question of freewill only arises because we or ego is ignorant.   
We are free always because we are NOT the ego, but the eternal Self?   
Believing that we are the ego, life and personalty, that is the mistake.   
So to believe in freewill is to believe we are the ego.   
That would only compound the first mistake.

Without free-will there could be no spiritual progress. Free-will is  
essential. Free-will relates to mind and not to the body.   
It is said that karma/destiny is decided at the moment of birth and that what  
the ego/mind/body complex has to endure, it will endure, no matter how much  
you try to avoid it. However, we are free to identify with it or not.   
In the Uddahava Gita, Lord Krishna states: XIII  
Extinction of the I-sense  
Sattva, Rajas and Tamas are the qualities of prakriti (phenomena), and not of  
the Self. By Sattva the other two are subdued, and Sattva by Sattva itself.  
From Sattva arises righteousness which inevitably leads to devotion and  
culminates in the realisation of the Self. Righteousness curbs unrighteousness  
which rises from Rajas and Tamas.   
Uddhava remarked that most men know that the sensuous pleasures are baneful in  
their results, inviting endless trouble, yet like dogs, donkeys and goats they  
heartily plunge into them, and asked why it is so. The Lord answered: It all begins with the perverse sense of I rising in the heart, which  
causes the formidable, misery-ridden rajas to invade the mind and induce it to  
conceive notions of enjoyable objects and the means of enjoying them. Long  
brooding on the attractive features of a particular object creates an  
uncontrollable passion for it, which overwhelms the mind and impels  
irrevocable actions. Although the perception of the evil consequences of such  
actions is present, the impetuosity of the passion is too strong to arrest  
them. But the man of discrimination exerts hard to control his infatuation,  
and, thus, spares himself future suffering. Such a man will turn his mind to  
Me, away from everything else, and will be finally established in Me. This is  
the Yoga which I taught to Brahma in the presence of My disciples, the four  
Kumaras, Sanaka and his brothers.   
\   
This clearly indicates free-will at work and the fruit of desire.   
As I have said elsewhere on this forum, everyone would do well to read the  
Srimad Bhagavatham, which dispels all doubts about creation and Self.

Dear kde, I think free will must exist.Coz without it whole Creation would be  
mehanic,and without sense.If all is predestined,karma doasn have any  
meaning.How then we can learn from our mistakes,experiences.Our exsistence is  
then meaningless.In some way you cant answer on that question with no or  
yes.Coz in some way it exist.On other side,without time,space and causation,it

The only desire we can have, Bhagavan says is to only have desire for  
realising the Self. This is the only Free Will we have.   
Another name or term for Free Will is Desire.   
We have right to desire only for the Self alone

"It is said that karma/destiny is decided at the moment of birth and that what  
the ego/mind/body complex has to endure, it will endure, no matter how much  
you try to avoid it. However, we are free to identify with it or not".   
Thats an excellent answer, yet as Jewell said it still leaves us acting like  
mechanical robots, following a predestined path. Only with the choice not to  
identify with it. Perhaps thats all the choice we need.   
I think we are free to identify or not with the mind/body, even then its very  
hard not to identify with it. I feel something other then my own weak will is  
needed to break the iron grip of illusion. So we can only do so in line with  
our capacity to do so.   
Ramana: Free-Will holds the field in association with individuality. As long  
as individuality lasts so long there is Free-Will. All the sastras are based  
on this fact and they advise directing the Free-Will in the right channel.Find  
out to whom Free-Will or Destiny matters. Abide in it. Then these two are  
transcended. That is the only purpose of discussing these questions. To whom  
do these questions arise? Find out and be at peace.   
Ramana always returns to the point of solving the problem.

## Re:[15] Question on free will  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 08, 2010, 12:23:51 PM  
---  
This has been explained by Bhagavan Ramana, in ULLadu Narpadu,   
Verse 19.   
Muruganar also says in Padamalai, Verse 987:- What is to come   
will automatically come. What is not, will not come. [Therefore],   
remain in your blissful natural state. (Tr. David Godman.)   
Talks No. 426 states:-   
Question: Has many any free will or is everything in his pre-   
destined and pre-ordained?   
Bhagavan: Free will holds the field in association with individuality.   
As long as the individuality lasts, there is free will. All the sastras   
are based on this fact and they advise directing the free will in the right  
channel. Find out to whom free will or destiny matters. Abide in it. Then,  
these two are transcended. That is the only purpose   
of discussing these questions. To whom do these questions arise? Find out  
and be at peace.   
Again, Muruganar says in Padamalai, Verse 2070:-   
Nothing happens except that which is divinely ordained. Consequently, it is  
pointless for people, [who want the world   
to be different] to experience anxiety and to be debilitated by   
distress. (Tr. David Godman.)   
In Guru Vachaka Kovai, Muruganar has also given his paraphrased   
comments for Verse 1191, which runs as under:-   
No one can do anything that is opposed to the ordinance of the Supreme Lord  
who possesses unlimited power and who can do anything. Therefore, to end the  
anxiety of the deceptive mind,   
which engenders an evil discontent, the proper course is to remain   
under the spell of supreme consciousness, which arises from meditating on the  
divine feet, with the mischief of the ego suspended. (Tr. David Godman.)   
Day by Day, entry dated 1st June 1946 runs as under:-   
Question: In the early stages, would it not be a help to a man   
to seek solitude and give up his outer duties in life?   
Bhagavan: Renunciation is always in the mind, not in going to   
forests or solitary places or giving up one's duties. The main   
thing is to see that the mind does not turn outward but inward. It does not  
really rest with a man, whether he goes to this place or that or whether he  
gives up his duties or not. All that happens according to destiny. All the  
activities that the body is to go through are determined when it first comes  
into existence. It does not rest with you to accept or reject them. THE ONLY  
FREEDOM YOU HAVE IS TO TURN YOUR MIND INWARD AND RENOUNCE ACTIVITIES  
THERE......   
If you want to go to fundamentals, you must enquire who you are and find out  
who it is who has freedom or destiny. Who are you and why did you get this  
body that has these limitations?   
Padamalai Verse 922:- In the blissful experience of Jnana, the Self, those  
prarabdha experiences will not cling to the "I".   
For this Muruganar's paraphrased comments for Guru Vachaka Kovai Verse 698,  
has been given by David Godman.   
Prarabdha, which like a whirlwind, relentlessly agitates and spins the mind  
that has shrunk through dehatma buddhi, cannot even slightly stir the adjunct-  
free mind that shines as the extremely clear space of pure consciousness, when  
the ego-impurity is destroyed by self enquiry. [Since a mind shining as the  
infinite expanse of consciousness is perfect, there is no agitation.].   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear kde, When i said that everything cant be predestined,i was thinking on  
our complete journey.From our first meating with this Universe.The moment we  
came in time and space.Then,we made our destinies little by little.And i  
believe we are making it now also.For me that is the free will.We can do good  
or bad,everything is bidding us here.We can free ourselfs from illusion only  
with time,patience,faith and Gods Grace.Then we dont need free will.But i  
believe Dear Ramana said very important thing:"From who those question  
arise?".That is the right question.And i would ask you also,whay you asked  
same question.But it is question to ask yourself.Not to answer me.Coz im not a  
jnani,and all this is only my thinking.

Thanks Jewell, I agree we must be making our destiny now, and it needed a  
starting point. A time   
when we would have had no destiny.   
I think for now I'm sticking to a working model, that we have the freewill to  
identify or not with the mind/body. It's hard to sort compulsion out from  
freewill in my thinking. Or at least doing what is in my interest. I shouldn't  
linger to long really. Maybe it's not such an important question, so much as  
who asks.   
I'm thankful to everyone that has helped on this thread.

I have been thinking lately about this, and started to doubt we have any free  
will at all.   
It seems to me we ether have total free will or none at all. The later seems  
most likely to me. Though the illusion of free will is present.   
Can someone say what did Ramana think regarding free will?

Dear kde,   
There is NO FREE WILL at all for anyone. Everything is predestined.   
He said Devaraja Mudaliar, when the latter asked Him about it: Everything is predestined.   
Mudaliar: Even my putting the hand fan on the floor or getting it   
again for some breeze?   
Bhagavan: Yes.   
Mudaliar: Even my intention to take a cup of water....?   
Bhagavan: Yes. Nothing happens without the destiny. There   
is no free will. I came away from my family to T'malai, so that   
I could be free. But here, there is a bigger family around me.   
Where is the free will?   
But a self realized Jnani does not care about free will or destiny.   
For him, both are not there. Because, he has seen the source of   
both, that is, the Self. See ULLadu Narpadu, Verse 19. So long   
as you do not use discrimination of real and unreal and attain the   
Reality, the free will-destiny discussions will go on.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian.R,   
Thanks for your reply. I was hoping someone would argue in favor of freewill.  
It's something I will have to think about more.   
On the other hand, Ramana seems very clear on the subject. If everything is  
decided before birth, then even our every thought is predestined. It would  
seem that surrender is the only course to take. Even that would be  
predestined.   
It's believable but hard to accept.

Dear kde,   
Yes. There are several siddha (yogic) poets who have sung in their   
songs about destiny and total surrender to Siva. One   
siddha saint had said: "In sleep, I inhale, and if that air does not come  
back to my nostril again, after exhalation, O Siva, who is there but You, for  
me?"   
One another siddha saint had sung: He took his hearty meals from   
his wife's hands. He put of the lights and copulated with her joyously.  
Then, "He said, there is some pain on my left chest...."   
He was not there to speak any more! O Siva, what can I do in   
life, but to seek your grace?   
The impermanence of life - if one truly understands, he will surrender to God  
totally.   
Arunachala Siva.

So the question of freewill only arises because we or ego is ignorant.   
We are free always because we are NOT the ego, but the eternal Self?   
Believing that we are the ego, life and personalty, that is the mistake.   
So to believe in freewill is to believe we are the ego.   
That would only compound the first mistake.   
Thanks for you answers. I think I get it.

Without free-will there could be no spiritual progress. Free-will is  
essential. Free-will relates to mind and not to the body.   
It is said that karma/destiny is decided at the moment of birth and that what  
the ego/mind/body complex has to endure, it will endure, no matter how much  
you try to avoid it. However, we are free to identify with it or not.   
In the Uddahava Gita, Lord Krishna states: XIII  
Extinction of the I-sense  
Sattva, Rajas and Tamas are the qualities of prakriti (phenomena), and not of  
the Self. By Sattva the other two are subdued, and Sattva by Sattva itself.  
From Sattva arises righteousness which inevitably leads to devotion and  
culminates in the realisation of the Self. Righteousness curbs unrighteousness  
which rises from Rajas and Tamas.   
Uddhava remarked that most men know that the sensuous pleasures are baneful in  
their results, inviting endless trouble, yet like dogs, donkeys and goats they  
heartily plunge into them, and asked why it is so. The Lord answered: It all begins with the perverse sense of I rising in the heart, which  
causes the formidable, misery-ridden rajas to invade the mind and induce it to  
conceive notions of enjoyable objects and the means of enjoying them. Long  
brooding on the attractive features of a particular object creates an  
uncontrollable passion for it, which overwhelms the mind and impels  
irrevocable actions. Although the perception of the evil consequences of such  
actions is present, the impetuosity of the passion is too strong to arrest  
them. But the man of discrimination exerts hard to control his infatuation,  
and, thus, spares himself future suffering. Such a man will turn his mind to  
Me, away from everything else, and will be finally established in Me. This is  
the Yoga which I taught to Brahma in the presence of My disciples, the four  
Kumaras, Sanaka and his brothers.   
\   
This clearly indicates free-will at work and the fruit of desire.   
As I have said elsewhere on this forum, everyone would do well to read the  
Srimad Bhagavatham, which dispels all doubts about creation and Self.

Dear kde, I think free will must exist.Coz without it whole Creation would be  
mehanic,and without sense.If all is predestined,karma doasn have any  
meaning.How then we can learn from our mistakes,experiences.Our exsistence is  
then meaningless.In some way you cant answer on that question with no or  
yes.Coz in some way it exist.On other side,without time,space and causation,it  
probably doasnt exist.Its very relative and complex.Here,i believe it  
exist.Without i would be just a slave.And i know im not a slave.

We have choice to act.That can be right or wrong.Acording to that we must bear  
consequences.But apart from that we do have free choice,will.

I think we can use our free will to be silent and to do atma vicharam.   
Other than this we have to bear the fruit whether good or bad.

The only desire we can have, Bhagavan says is to only have desire for  
realising the Self. This is the only Free Will we have.   
Another name or term for Free Will is Desire.   
We have right to desire only for the Self alone

"It is said that karma/destiny is decided at the moment of birth and that what  
the ego/mind/body complex has to endure, it will endure, no matter how much  
you try to avoid it. However, we are free to identify with it or not".   
Thats an excellent answer, yet as Jewell said it still leaves us acting like  
mechanical robots, following a predestined path. Only with the choice not to  
identify with it. Perhaps thats all the choice we need.   
I think we are free to identify or not with the mind/body, even then its very  
hard not to identify with it. I feel something other then my own weak will is  
needed to break the iron grip of illusion. So we can only do so in line with  
our capacity to do so.   
Ramana: Free-Will holds the field in association with individuality. As long  
as individuality lasts so long there is Free-Will. All the sastras are based  
on this fact and they advise directing the Free-Will in the right channel.Find  
out to whom Free-Will or Destiny matters. Abide in it. Then these two are  
transcended. That is the only purpose of discussing these questions. To whom  
do these questions arise? Find out and be at peace.   
Ramana always returns to the point of solving the problem.

## Re:[15] Question on free will  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 08, 2010, 12:23:51 PM

This has been explained by Bhagavan Ramana, in ULLadu Narpadu,   
Verse 19.   
Muruganar also says in Padamalai, Verse 987:- What is to come   
will automatically come. What is not, will not come. [Therefore],   
remain in your blissful natural state. (Tr. David Godman.)   
Talks No. 426 states:-   
Question: Has many any free will or is everything in his pre-   
destined and pre-ordained?   
Bhagavan: Free will holds the field in association with individuality.   
As long as the individuality lasts, there is free will. All the sastras   
are based on this fact and they advise directing the free will in the right  
channel. Find out to whom free will or destiny matters. Abide in it. Then,  
these two are transcended. That is the only purpose   
of discussing these questions. To whom do these questions arise? Find out  
and be at peace.   
Again, Muruganar says in Padamalai, Verse 2070:-   
Nothing happens except that which is divinely ordained. Consequently, it is  
pointless for people, [who want the world   
to be different] to experience anxiety and to be debilitated by   
distress. (Tr. David Godman.)   
In Guru Vachaka Kovai, Muruganar has also given his paraphrased   
comments for Verse 1191, which runs as under:-   
No one can do anything that is opposed to the ordinance of the Supreme Lord  
who possesses unlimited power and who can do anything. Therefore, to end the  
anxiety of the deceptive mind,   
which engenders an evil discontent, the proper course is to remain   
under the spell of supreme consciousness, which arises from meditating on the  
divine feet, with the mischief of the ego suspended. (Tr. David Godman.)   
Day by Day, entry dated 1st June 1946 runs as under:-   
Question: In the early stages, would it not be a help to a man   
to seek solitude and give up his outer duties in life?   
Bhagavan: Renunciation is always in the mind, not in going to   
forests or solitary places or giving up one's duties. The main   
thing is to see that the mind does not turn outward but inward. It does not  
really rest with a man, whether he goes to this place or that or whether he  
gives up his duties or not. All that happens according to destiny. All the  
activities that the body is to go through are determined when it first comes  
into existence. It does not rest with you to accept or reject them. THE ONLY  
FREEDOM YOU HAVE IS TO TURN YOUR MIND INWARD AND RENOUNCE ACTIVITIES  
THERE......   
If you want to go to fundamentals, you must enquire who you are and find out  
who it is who has freedom or destiny. Who are you and why did you get this  
body that has these limitations?   
Padamalai Verse 922:- In the blissful experience of Jnana, the Self, those  
prarabdha experiences will not cling to the "I".   
For this Muruganar's paraphrased comments for Guru Vachaka Kovai Verse 698,  
has been given by David Godman.   
Prarabdha, which like a whirlwind, relentlessly agitates and spins the mind  
that has shrunk through dehatma buddhi, cannot even slightly stir the adjunct-  
free mind that shines as the extremely clear space of pure consciousness, when  
the ego-impurity is destroyed by self enquiry. [Since a mind shining as the  
infinite expanse of consciousness is perfect, there is no agitation.].   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear kde, When i said that everything cant be predestined,i was thinking on  
our complete journey.From our first meating with this Universe.The moment we  
came in time and space.Then,we made our destinies little by little.And i  
believe we are making it now also.For me that is the free will.We can do good  
or bad,everything is bidding us here.We can free ourselfs from illusion only  
with time,patience,faith and Gods Grace.Then we dont need free will.But i  
believe Dear Ramana said very important thing:"From who those question  
arise?".That is the right question.And i would ask you also,whay you asked  
same question.But it is question to ask yourself.Not to answer me.Coz im not a  
jnani,and all this is only my thinking.

Thanks Jewell, I agree we must be making our destiny now, and it needed a  
starting point. A time   
when we would have had no destiny.   
I think for now I'm sticking to a working model, that we have the freewill to  
identify or not with the mind/body. It's hard to sort compulsion out from  
freewill in my thinking. Or at least doing what is in my interest. I shouldn't  
linger to long really. Maybe it's not such an important question, so much as  
who asks.   
I'm thankful to everyone that has helped on this thread.
