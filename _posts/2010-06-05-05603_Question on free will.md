## Question on free will  
Author: kde                 Date: June 05, 2010, 07:30:07 PM  
---  
I have been thinking lately about this, and started to doubt we have any free  
will at all.   
It seems to me we ether have total free will or none at all. The later seems  
most likely to me. Though the illusion of free will is present.   
Can someone say what did Ramana think regarding free will?

Dear kde,   
There is NO FREE WILL at all for anyone. Everything is predestined.   
He said Devaraja Mudaliar, when the latter asked Him about it: Everything is predestined.   
Mudaliar: Even my putting the hand fan on the floor or getting it   
again for some breeze?   
Bhagavan: Yes.   
Mudaliar: Even my intention to take a cup of water....?   
Bhagavan: Yes. Nothing happens without the destiny. There   
is no free will. I came away from my family to T'malai, so that   
I could be free. But here, there is a bigger family around me.   
Where is the free will?   
But a self realized Jnani does not care about free will or destiny.   
For him, both are not there. Because, he has seen the source of   
both, that is, the Self. See ULLadu Narpadu, Verse 19. So long   
as you do not use discrimination of real and unreal and attain the   
Reality, the free will-destiny discussions will go on.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian.R,   
Thanks for your reply. I was hoping someone would argue in favor of freewill.  
It's something I will have to think about more.   
On the other hand, Ramana seems very clear on the subject. If everything is  
decided before birth, then even our every thought is predestined. It would  
seem that surrender is the only course to take. Even that would be  
predestined.   
It's believable but hard to accept.   
Regards

Dear kde,   
Yes. There are several siddha (yogic) poets who have sung in their   
songs about destiny and total surrender to Siva. One   
siddha saint had said: "In sleep, I inhale, and if that air does not come  
back to my nostril again, after exhalation, O Siva, who is there but You, for  
me?"   
One another siddha saint had sung: He took his hearty meals from   
his wife's hands. He put of the lights and copulated with her joyously.  
Then, "He said, there is some pain on my left chest...."   
He was not there to speak any more! O Siva, what can I do in   
life, but to seek your grace?   
The impermanence of life - if one truly understands, he will surrender to God  
totally.   
Arunachala Siva.

Advaita proclaims we all are ever free. But when we do not understand then the  
question arises whether I got free will or not. Jnanis never bother about free  
will.

It is only the Ego that dabbles with the idea about freewill, goes in search  
of happiness, but in vain.

So the question of freewill only arises because we or ego is ignorant.   
We are free always because we are NOT the ego, but the eternal Self?   
Believing that we are the ego, life and personalty, that is the mistake.   
So to believe in freewill is to believe we are the ego.   
That would only compound the first mistake.   
Thanks for you answers. I think I get it.

Without free-will there could be no spiritual progress. Free-will is  
essential. Free-will relates to mind and not to the body.   
It is said that karma/destiny is decided at the moment of birth and that what  
the ego/mind/body complex has to endure, it will endure, no matter how much  
you try to avoid it. However, we are free to identify with it or not.   
In the Uddahava Gita, Lord Krishna states: XIII  
Extinction of the I-sense  
Sattva, Rajas and Tamas are the qualities of prakriti (phenomena), and not of  
the Self. By Sattva the other two are subdued, and Sattva by Sattva itself.  
From Sattva arises righteousness which inevitably leads to devotion and  
culminates in the realisation of the Self. Righteousness curbs unrighteousness  
which rises from Rajas and Tamas.   
Uddhava remarked that most men know that the sensuous pleasures are baneful in  
their results, inviting endless trouble, yet like dogs, donkeys and goats they  
heartily plunge into them, and asked why it is so. The Lord answered: It all begins with the perverse sense of I rising in the heart, which  
causes the formidable, misery-ridden rajas to invade the mind and induce it to  
conceive notions of enjoyable objects and the means of enjoying them. Long  
brooding on the attractive features of a particular object creates an  
uncontrollable passion for it, which overwhelms the mind and impels  
irrevocable actions. Although the perception of the evil consequences of such  
actions is present, the impetuosity of the passion is too strong to arrest  
them. But the man of discrimination exerts hard to control his infatuation,  
and, thus, spares himself future suffering. Such a man will turn his mind to  
Me, away from everything else, and will be finally established in Me. This is  
the Yoga which I taught to Brahma in the presence of My disciples, the four  
Kumaras, Sanaka and his brothers.   
\   
This clearly indicates free-will at work and the fruit of desire.   
As I have said elsewhere on this forum, everyone would do well to read the  
Srimad Bhagavatham, which dispels all doubts about creation and Self.

Dear kde, I think free will must exist.Coz without it whole Creation would be  
mehanic,and without sense.If all is predestined,karma doasn have any  
meaning.How then we can learn from our mistakes,experiences.Our exsistence is  
then meaningless.In some way you cant answer on that question with no or  
yes.Coz in some way it exist.On other side,without time,space and causation,it  
probably doasnt exist.Its very relative and complex.Here,i believe it  
exist.Without i would be just a slave.And i know im not a slave.

We have choice to act.That can be right or wrong.Acording to that we must bear  
consequences.But apart from that we do have free choice,will.

I think we can use our free will to be silent and to do atma vicharam.   
Other than this we have to bear the fruit whether good or bad.

The only desire we can have, Bhagavan says is to only have desire for  
realising the Self. This is the only Free Will we have.   
Another name or term for Free Will is Desire.   
We have right to desire only for the Self alone

"It is said that karma/destiny is decided at the moment of birth and that what  
the ego/mind/body complex has to endure, it will endure, no matter how much  
you try to avoid it. However, we are free to identify with it or not".   
Thats an excellent answer, yet as Jewell said it still leaves us acting like  
mechanical robots, following a predestined path. Only with the choice not to  
identify with it. Perhaps thats all the choice we need.   
I think we are free to identify or not with the mind/body, even then its very  
hard not to identify with it. I feel something other then my own weak will is  
needed to break the iron grip of illusion. So we can only do so in line with  
our capacity to do so.   
Ramana: Free-Will holds the field in association with individuality. As long  
as individuality lasts so long there is Free-Will. All the sastras are based  
on this fact and they advise directing the Free-Will in the right channel.Find  
out to whom Free-Will or Destiny matters. Abide in it. Then these two are  
transcended. That is the only purpose of discussing these questions. To whom  
do these questions arise? Find out and be at peace.   
Ramana always returns to the point of solving the problem.

## Re:[15] Question on free will  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 08, 2010, 12:23:51 PM

This has been explained by Bhagavan Ramana, in ULLadu Narpadu,   
Verse 19.   
Muruganar also says in Padamalai, Verse 987:- What is to come   
will automatically come. What is not, will not come. [Therefore],   
remain in your blissful natural state. (Tr. David Godman.)   
Talks No. 426 states:-   
Question: Has many any free will or is everything in his pre-   
destined and pre-ordained?   
Bhagavan: Free will holds the field in association with individuality.   
As long as the individuality lasts, there is free will. All the sastras   
are based on this fact and they advise directing the free will in the right  
channel. Find out to whom free will or destiny matters. Abide in it. Then,  
these two are transcended. That is the only purpose   
of discussing these questions. To whom do these questions arise? Find out  
and be at peace.   
Again, Muruganar says in Padamalai, Verse 2070:-   
Nothing happens except that which is divinely ordained. Consequently, it is  
pointless for people, [who want the world   
to be different] to experience anxiety and to be debilitated by   
distress. (Tr. David Godman.)   
In Guru Vachaka Kovai, Muruganar has also given his paraphrased   
comments for Verse 1191, which runs as under:-   
No one can do anything that is opposed to the ordinance of the Supreme Lord  
who possesses unlimited power and who can do anything. Therefore, to end the  
anxiety of the deceptive mind,   
which engenders an evil discontent, the proper course is to remain   
under the spell of supreme consciousness, which arises from meditating on the  
divine feet, with the mischief of the ego suspended. (Tr. David Godman.)   
Day by Day, entry dated 1st June 1946 runs as under:-   
Question: In the early stages, would it not be a help to a man   
to seek solitude and give up his outer duties in life?   
Bhagavan: Renunciation is always in the mind, not in going to   
forests or solitary places or giving up one's duties. The main   
thing is to see that the mind does not turn outward but inward. It does not  
really rest with a man, whether he goes to this place or that or whether he  
gives up his duties or not. All that happens according to destiny. All the  
activities that the body is to go through are determined when it first comes  
into existence. It does not rest with you to accept or reject them. THE ONLY  
FREEDOM YOU HAVE IS TO TURN YOUR MIND INWARD AND RENOUNCE ACTIVITIES  
THERE......   
If you want to go to fundamentals, you must enquire who you are and find out  
who it is who has freedom or destiny. Who are you and why did you get this  
body that has these limitations?   
Padamalai Verse 922:- In the blissful experience of Jnana, the Self, those  
prarabdha experiences will not cling to the "I".   
For this Muruganar's paraphrased comments for Guru Vachaka Kovai Verse 698,  
has been given by David Godman.   
Prarabdha, which like a whirlwind, relentlessly agitates and spins the mind  
that has shrunk through dehatma buddhi, cannot even slightly stir the adjunct-  
free mind that shines as the extremely clear space of pure consciousness, when  
the ego-impurity is destroyed by self enquiry. [Since a mind shining as the  
infinite expanse of consciousness is perfect, there is no agitation.].   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear kde, When i said that everything cant be predestined,i was thinking on  
our complete journey.From our first meating with this Universe.The moment we  
came in time and space.Then,we made our destinies little by little.And i  
believe we are making it now also.For me that is the free will.We can do good  
or bad,everything is bidding us here.We can free ourselfs from illusion only  
with time,patience,faith and Gods Grace.Then we dont need free will.But i  
believe Dear Ramana said very important thing:"From who those question  
arise?".That is the right question.And i would ask you also,whay you asked  
same question.But it is question to ask yourself.Not to answer me.Coz im not a  
jnani,and all this is only my thinking.

Thanks Jewell, I agree we must be making our destiny now, and it needed a  
starting point. A time   
when we would have had no destiny.   
I think for now I'm sticking to a working model, that we have the freewill to  
identify or not with the mind/body. It's hard to sort compulsion out from  
freewill in my thinking. Or at least doing what is in my interest. I shouldn't  
linger to long really. Maybe it's not such an important question, so much as  
who asks.   
I'm thankful to everyone that has helped on this thread.
