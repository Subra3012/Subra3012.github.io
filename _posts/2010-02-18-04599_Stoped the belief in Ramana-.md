I must have to tell this to evryone keen on ramana. I want to echo my  
feelings and dispointments to evryone here.   
I have dedicated myself to ramana and many times I have seen him in deep  
sleep.. (i wont call it has a sleep..kind of trance state. .I go to bed  
assuming that I will sleep after sometime but it is not a sleep.).I have lost  
my sleep long back.. It is something different feeling. .I used to expereince  
...   
so many things I heard from him. .but nothing has happend till date. . I  
wonder is this something wrong with me...   
or ramana's grace is fake..?.. I don't know - what happened to me..?. .A good  
sprit has caputured me...? or is it a fake one..   
I dont know - How many ppl suffering like this kind of phobia.?..... I have  
lost all the faith in ramana....and I am sure not hurting any devotee of  
ramana. But I have every right in telling everyone this.

Dear I,   
Don't worry about all these experiences, they are very normal for all kinds of  
aspirants of Truth all over across religions. It is sure mark of progress and  
it is very evident that Grinding is happening. Let it all happen, just remain  
observant to all these happenings. Whether it is a pleasant or divine  
experience or a painful or suffering experience, just be aware of it. Life is  
all about experiencing. Experience it all in absolute fullness. Like the  
passing cloud it will all fade away.   
Even if you don't get sleep, its ok, its pretty normal, don't force yourself  
to sleep, that will complicate the matter, you are not getting sleep, its a  
genuine expression, just accept the situation and spend the time in a way that  
will lift you, say read good books or something that will give you peace.   
Patience is the key, Like Ramana, Shirdi Sai Baba's main teaching is Shraddha  
and Saburi or patience. nothing happens in a day, month and year. Let the  
nature take its own time. In the mean time, just willingly joyfully bear or  
put up with all problems and sufferings and spiritual ups and downs in a  
positive way.   
One thing is assured, as the grinding has started, there is only one way, the  
way upwards - towards knowledge. You will soon see the light of knowledge and  
Ramana and it will all be clear then.   
Just hold on...   
Take it easy...   
Whatever happens, happens for your good, we just don't know. Bhagavan Ramana  
has said, we always thank God for all the Good that happens to us, but He asks  
do we thank God for all Bad things that happen to us? We think what is good  
only based on a small limited mind of ours, we decide as to what is good and  
and what is bad, But many things that we think good and when then don't happen  
to us, then know that that Good thing that we thought was actually bad for us.  
And somethings that we consider Bad will eventually turn out to be Good, when  
it is all clear as to why it happened!   
Remember these words of Bhagavan: The Ordainer controls the fate of souls in accordance to their destiny. What  
ever is bound NOT TO HAPPEN, will not happen, TRY AS YOU MAY, and whatever is  
BOUND TO HAPPEN, WILL HAPPEN, do what you may to prevent it. The best course,  
therefore is to remain silent.   
Experience Life, till Life offers experience to you, on the hand, keep up what  
you are doing, just don't worry about your disappointments, they will all fade  
away like the passing cloud.   
If you notice carefully, there is one thing absolutely unchanged, just focus  
and and you will see that it is the 'SEER' who is narrating all these detail,  
the one that is aware of all things and happenings. See if that is changing!  
That which is aware of changes is the real YOU. Find out that YOU. Who am I to  
whom all these appearances and changes, dreams, illusions, various experiences  
are arising to.   
Thats all I can say... from my own small experiences...   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear arunaja,   
Perseverence is the key. Do not despair. Many people have told Bhagavan   
Ramana that when they were coming for third or fourth time to Arunachala,   
their ego got only bigger. This happens. Because the ego/mind fights   
its last battle to keep you under its control. Go past these desparations.   
Ramana is the Truth. Only the ego/mind which tries to do magic with   
you is fake.   
Arunachala Siva.

I lost faith many times because of suffering in life,   
and everytime I came back with firmer faith than before.   
I hope you come back with firmer and deeper faith in the future.   
Quote: Bhagavan: It is good if suffering comes to devotees.   
.....All sufferings are given for the sole purpose of purifying the mind of  
the devotees.   
If we are patient, hapiness will follow.

Dear arunraja,   
I shall tell you a happening in my life. My mother was a great   
devotee of Satya Sai Baba. She used to fast full day on Thrusdays.   
My sister, at a young age of 29, died suddenly due to some mis-   
management of a surgery. The corpse came from the hospital.   
Mother and everyone else cried, cried. My mother then took out   
the photographs of Satya Sai Baba, (glass-framed) and threw them   
on the floor! After one year, she went back to Satya Sai Baba.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear arunaja,   
 This happens very often when the time is really tough, we seek God's help! We want God to save us from it! But somehow it does not work out! May be we cry and pleed but things do not go our way!   
This is one way of approaching God! To look at him as someone who can "Save"  
us!   
The other way of looking at God is someone who stays with us, gives us a  
support... is with us ! When everything is going wrong, some one remains with  
us! When i am ill, my body is leaving, my heart is stopping, my mind is not  
functioning fine. .. every faculty is disturbed. .. perhaps i am not able to  
breathe properly. .. All our relatives are eagerly waiting. .. "outside" this  
body. .. looking at it helplessly. .. only God stays "With" you!   
He may not really help you out! Why, i do not know! He is There! As the  
Silence within. .. and the suffering which started has to come to an end some  
day! The Silence within, is God. The Silence within... mute spectator... is  
There with you! through your suffering! The suffering cannot be eliminated,   
perhaps! or perhaps it can be! I really do not know! God is that Friend who is  
there with you! Who is with You ! You can say "I do not need such a God". ..  
he still is there!   
Love!   
Silence

people who has faith also are suffering, but some people scold god for not  
saving them during the suffering. But god will take care two of these people  
in same manner.   
"A" who has faith on God, understands even we hate or scold God never leaves  
anybody because He has unconditional love. On the other hand "B" who scolds  
God for his own suffering cannot run from God. For both of them God only gives  
the mind but one person's mind works in positive way another one's works in  
negative way.   
When they ask me I cannot explain them why God simply watches their suffering.  
If I say, it is our past karma they say, they do not want such a god.I do not  
know how to explain them.   
The same God should come tell them in front of them.   
Does this faith come out of practice or habit? Whatever it may be for total  
surrender we need Bhakti. For having bhakti we should have faith. This faith  
also we should nurture it day by day without fail, that what I believe.

Grace is karuna, the female concorporate of Siva in Saiva Siddhantam. But in   
Advaita, Grace is the very nature of Brahman. Bhagavan Ramana uses the word   
Karunai, Grace, in Sri Arunachala Padigam, Verse 1. Christians name their  
girl   
children as Grace, Mercy etc.,   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear I,   
Don't worry about all these experiences, they are very normal for all kinds of  
aspirants of Truth all over across religions. It is sure mark of progress and  
it is very evident that Grinding is happening. Let it all happen, just remain  
observant to all these happenings. Whether it is a pleasant or divine  
experience or a painful or suffering experience, just be aware of it. Life is  
all about experiencing. Experience it all in absolute fullness. Like the  
passing cloud it will all fade away.   
Even if you don't get sleep, its ok, its pretty normal, don't force yourself  
to sleep, that will complicate the matter, you are not getting sleep, its a  
genuine expression, just accept the situation and spend the time in a way that  
will lift you, say read good books or something that will give you peace.   
Patience is the key, Like Ramana, Shirdi Sai Baba's main teaching is Shraddha  
and Saburi or patience. nothing happens in a day, month and year. Let the  
nature take its own time. In the mean time, just willingly joyfully bear or  
put up with all problems and sufferings and spiritual ups and downs in a  
positive way.   
One thing is assured, as the grinding has started, there is only one way, the  
way upwards - towards knowledge. You will soon see the light of knowledge and  
Ramana and it will all be clear then.   
Just hold on...   
Take it easy...   
Whatever happens, happens for your good, we just don't know. Bhagavan Ramana  
has said, we always thank God for all the Good that happens to us, but He asks  
do we thank God for all Bad things that happen to us? We think what is good  
only based on a small limited mind of ours, we decide as to what is good and  
and what is bad, But many things that we think good and when then don't happen  
to us, then know that that Good thing that we thought was actually bad for us.  
And somethings that we consider Bad will eventually turn out to be Good, when  
it is all clear as to why it happened!   
Remember these words of Bhagavan: The Ordainer controls the fate of souls in accordance to their destiny. What  
ever is bound NOT TO HAPPEN, will not happen, TRY AS YOU MAY, and whatever is  
BOUND TO HAPPEN, WILL HAPPEN, do what you may to prevent it. The best course,  
therefore is to remain silent.   
Experience Life, till Life offers experience to you, on the hand, keep up what  
you are doing, just don't worry about your disappointments, they will all fade  
away like the passing cloud.   
If you notice carefully, there is one thing absolutely unchanged, just focus  
and and you will see that it is the 'SEER' who is narrating all these detail,  
the one that is aware of all things and happenings. See if that is changing!  
That which is aware of changes is the real YOU. Find out that YOU. Who am I to  
whom all these appearances and changes, dreams, illusions, various experiences  
are arising to.   
Thats all I can say... from my own small experiences...   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear arunaja,   
Perseverence is the key. Do not despair. Many people have told Bhagavan   
Ramana that when they were coming for third or fourth time to Arunachala,   
their ego got only bigger. This happens. Because the ego/mind fights   
its last battle to keep you under its control. Go past these desparations.   
Ramana is the Truth. Only the ego/mind which tries to do magic with   
you is fake.   
Arunachala Siva.

I lost faith many times because of suffering in life,   
and everytime I came back with firmer faith than before.   
I hope you come back with firmer and deeper faith in the future.

.....All sufferings are given for the sole purpose of purifying the mind of  
the devotees.   
If we are patient, hapiness will follow.

Dear arunraja,   
I shall tell you a happening in my life. My mother was a great   
devotee of Satya Sai Baba. She used to fast full day on Thrusdays.   
My sister, at a young age of 29, died suddenly due to some mis-   
management of a surgery. The corpse came from the hospital.   
Mother and everyone else cried, cried. My mother then took out   
the photographs of Satya Sai Baba, (glass-framed) and threw them   
on the floor! After one year, she went back to Satya Sai Baba.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear arunaja,   
 This happens very often when the time is really tough, we seek God's help! We want God to save us from it! But somehow it does not work out! May be we cry and pleed but things do not go our way!   
This is one way of approaching God! To look at him as someone who can "Save"  
us!   
The other way of looking at God is someone who stays with us, gives us a  
support... is with us ! When everything is going wrong, some one remains with  
us! When i am ill, my body is leaving, my heart is stopping, my mind is not  
functioning fine. .. every faculty is disturbed. .. perhaps i am not able to  
breathe properly. .. All our relatives are eagerly waiting. .. "outside" this  
body. .. looking at it helplessly. .. only God stays "With" you!   
He may not really help you out! Why, i do not know! He is There! As the  
Silence within. .. and the suffering which started has to come to an end some  
day! The Silence within, is God. The Silence within... mute spectator... is  
There with you! through your suffering! The suffering cannot be eliminated,   
perhaps! or perhaps it can be! I really do not know! God is that Friend who is  
there with you! Who is with You ! You can say "I do not need such a God". ..  
he still is there!   
Love!   
Silence

people who has faith also are suffering, but some people scold god for not  
saving them during the suffering. But god will take care two of these people  
in same manner.   
"A" who has faith on God, understands even we hate or scold God never leaves  
anybody because He has unconditional love. On the other hand "B" who scolds  
God for his own suffering cannot run from God. For both of them God only gives  
the mind but one person's mind works in positive way another one's works in  
negative way.   
When they ask me I cannot explain them why God simply watches their suffering.  
If I say, it is our past karma they say, they do not want such a god.I do not  
know how to explain them.   
The same God should come tell them in front of them.   
Does this faith come out of practice or habit? Whatever it may be for total  
surrender we need Bhakti. For having bhakti we should have faith. This faith  
also we should nurture it day by day without fail, that what I believe.

Grace is karuna, the female concorporate of Siva in Saiva Siddhantam. But in   
Advaita, Grace is the very nature of Brahman. Bhagavan Ramana uses the word   
Karunai, Grace, in Sri Arunachala Padigam, Verse 1. Christians name their

Dear I,   
Don't worry about all these experiences, they are very normal for all kinds of  
aspirants of Truth all over across religions. It is sure mark of progress and  
it is very evident that Grinding is happening. Let it all happen, just remain  
observant to all these happenings. Whether it is a pleasant or divine  
experience or a painful or suffering experience, just be aware of it. Life is  
all about experiencing. Experience it all in absolute fullness. Like the  
passing cloud it will all fade away.   
Even if you don't get sleep, its ok, its pretty normal, don't force yourself  
to sleep, that will complicate the matter, you are not getting sleep, its a  
genuine expression, just accept the situation and spend the time in a way that  
will lift you, say read good books or something that will give you peace.   
Patience is the key, Like Ramana, Shirdi Sai Baba's main teaching is Shraddha  
and Saburi or patience. nothing happens in a day, month and year. Let the  
nature take its own time. In the mean time, just willingly joyfully bear or  
put up with all problems and sufferings and spiritual ups and downs in a  
positive way.   
One thing is assured, as the grinding has started, there is only one way, the  
way upwards - towards knowledge. You will soon see the light of knowledge and  
Ramana and it will all be clear then.   
Just hold on...   
Take it easy...   
Whatever happens, happens for your good, we just don't know. Bhagavan Ramana  
has said, we always thank God for all the Good that happens to us, but He asks  
do we thank God for all Bad things that happen to us? We think what is good  
only based on a small limited mind of ours, we decide as to what is good and  
and what is bad, But many things that we think good and when then don't happen  
to us, then know that that Good thing that we thought was actually bad for us.  
And somethings that we consider Bad will eventually turn out to be Good, when  
it is all clear as to why it happened!   
Remember these words of Bhagavan: The Ordainer controls the fate of souls in accordance to their destiny. What  
ever is bound NOT TO HAPPEN, will not happen, TRY AS YOU MAY, and whatever is  
BOUND TO HAPPEN, WILL HAPPEN, do what you may to prevent it. The best course,  
therefore is to remain silent.   
Experience Life, till Life offers experience to you, on the hand, keep up what  
you are doing, just don't worry about your disappointments, they will all fade  
away like the passing cloud.   
If you notice carefully, there is one thing absolutely unchanged, just focus  
and and you will see that it is the 'SEER' who is narrating all these detail,  
the one that is aware of all things and happenings. See if that is changing!  
That which is aware of changes is the real YOU. Find out that YOU. Who am I to  
whom all these appearances and changes, dreams, illusions, various experiences  
are arising to.   
Thats all I can say... from my own small experiences...   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear arunaja,   
Perseverence is the key. Do not despair. Many people have told Bhagavan   
Ramana that when they were coming for third or fourth time to Arunachala,   
their ego got only bigger. This happens. Because the ego/mind fights   
its last battle to keep you under its control. Go past these desparations.   
Ramana is the Truth. Only the ego/mind which tries to do magic with   
you is fake.   
Arunachala Siva.

I lost faith many times because of suffering in life,   
and everytime I came back with firmer faith than before.   
I hope you come back with firmer and deeper faith in the future.

.....All sufferings are given for the sole purpose of purifying the mind of  
the devotees.   
If we are patient, hapiness will follow.

Dear arunraja,   
I shall tell you a happening in my life. My mother was a great   
devotee of Satya Sai Baba. She used to fast full day on Thrusdays.   
My sister, at a young age of 29, died suddenly due to some mis-   
management of a surgery. The corpse came from the hospital.   
Mother and everyone else cried, cried. My mother then took out   
the photographs of Satya Sai Baba, (glass-framed) and threw them   
on the floor! After one year, she went back to Satya Sai Baba.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear arunaja,   
 This happens very often when the time is really tough, we seek God's help! We want God to save us from it! But somehow it does not work out! May be we cry and pleed but things do not go our way!   
This is one way of approaching God! To look at him as someone who can "Save"  
us!   
The other way of looking at God is someone who stays with us, gives us a  
support... is with us ! When everything is going wrong, some one remains with  
us! When i am ill, my body is leaving, my heart is stopping, my mind is not  
functioning fine. .. every faculty is disturbed. .. perhaps i am not able to  
breathe properly. .. All our relatives are eagerly waiting. .. "outside" this  
body. .. looking at it helplessly. .. only God stays "With" you!   
He may not really help you out! Why, i do not know! He is There! As the  
Silence within. .. and the suffering which started has to come to an end some  
day! The Silence within, is God. The Silence within... mute spectator... is  
There with you! through your suffering! The suffering cannot be eliminated,   
perhaps! or perhaps it can be! I really do not know! God is that Friend who is  
there with you! Who is with You ! You can say "I do not need such a God". ..  
he still is there!   
Love!   
Silence

people who has faith also are suffering, but some people scold god for not  
saving them during the suffering. But god will take care two of these people  
in same manner.   
"A" who has faith on God, understands even we hate or scold God never leaves  
anybody because He has unconditional love. On the other hand "B" who scolds  
God for his own suffering cannot run from God. For both of them God only gives  
the mind but one person's mind works in positive way another one's works in  
negative way.   
When they ask me I cannot explain them why God simply watches their suffering.  
If I say, it is our past karma they say, they do not want such a god.I do not  
know how to explain them.   
The same God should come tell them in front of them.   
Does this faith come out of practice or habit? Whatever it may be for total  
surrender we need Bhakti. For having bhakti we should have faith. This faith  
also we should nurture it day by day without fail, that what I believe.

Grace is karuna, the female concorporate of Siva in Saiva Siddhantam. But in   
Advaita, Grace is the very nature of Brahman. Bhagavan Ramana uses the word   
Karunai, Grace, in Sri Arunachala Padigam, Verse 1. Christians name their

Dear I,   
Don't worry about all these experiences, they are very normal for all kinds of  
aspirants of Truth all over across religions. It is sure mark of progress and  
it is very evident that Grinding is happening. Let it all happen, just remain  
observant to all these happenings. Whether it is a pleasant or divine  
experience or a painful or suffering experience, just be aware of it. Life is  
all about experiencing. Experience it all in absolute fullness. Like the  
passing cloud it will all fade away.   
Even if you don't get sleep, its ok, its pretty normal, don't force yourself  
to sleep, that will complicate the matter, you are not getting sleep, its a  
genuine expression, just accept the situation and spend the time in a way that  
will lift you, say read good books or something that will give you peace.   
Patience is the key, Like Ramana, Shirdi Sai Baba's main teaching is Shraddha  
and Saburi or patience. nothing happens in a day, month and year. Let the  
nature take its own time. In the mean time, just willingly joyfully bear or  
put up with all problems and sufferings and spiritual ups and downs in a  
positive way.   
One thing is assured, as the grinding has started, there is only one way, the  
way upwards - towards knowledge. You will soon see the light of knowledge and  
Ramana and it will all be clear then.   
Just hold on...   
Take it easy...   
Whatever happens, happens for your good, we just don't know. Bhagavan Ramana  
has said, we always thank God for all the Good that happens to us, but He asks  
do we thank God for all Bad things that happen to us? We think what is good  
only based on a small limited mind of ours, we decide as to what is good and  
and what is bad, But many things that we think good and when then don't happen  
to us, then know that that Good thing that we thought was actually bad for us.  
And somethings that we consider Bad will eventually turn out to be Good, when  
it is all clear as to why it happened!   
Remember these words of Bhagavan: The Ordainer controls the fate of souls in accordance to their destiny. What  
ever is bound NOT TO HAPPEN, will not happen, TRY AS YOU MAY, and whatever is  
BOUND TO HAPPEN, WILL HAPPEN, do what you may to prevent it. The best course,  
therefore is to remain silent.   
Experience Life, till Life offers experience to you, on the hand, keep up what  
you are doing, just don't worry about your disappointments, they will all fade  
away like the passing cloud.   
If you notice carefully, there is one thing absolutely unchanged, just focus  
and and you will see that it is the 'SEER' who is narrating all these detail,  
the one that is aware of all things and happenings. See if that is changing!  
That which is aware of changes is the real YOU. Find out that YOU. Who am I to  
whom all these appearances and changes, dreams, illusions, various experiences  
are arising to.   
Thats all I can say... from my own small experiences...   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear arunaja,   
Perseverence is the key. Do not despair. Many people have told Bhagavan   
Ramana that when they were coming for third or fourth time to Arunachala,   
their ego got only bigger. This happens. Because the ego/mind fights   
its last battle to keep you under its control. Go past these desparations.   
Ramana is the Truth. Only the ego/mind which tries to do magic with   
you is fake.   
Arunachala Siva.

I lost faith many times because of suffering in life,   
and everytime I came back with firmer faith than before.   
I hope you come back with firmer and deeper faith in the future.

.....All sufferings are given for the sole purpose of purifying the mind of  
the devotees.   
If we are patient, hapiness will follow.

Dear arunraja,   
I shall tell you a happening in my life. My mother was a great   
devotee of Satya Sai Baba. She used to fast full day on Thrusdays.   
My sister, at a young age of 29, died suddenly due to some mis-   
management of a surgery. The corpse came from the hospital.   
Mother and everyone else cried, cried. My mother then took out   
the photographs of Satya Sai Baba, (glass-framed) and threw them   
on the floor! After one year, she went back to Satya Sai Baba.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear arunaja,   
 This happens very often when the time is really tough, we seek God's help! We want God to save us from it! But somehow it does not work out! May be we cry and pleed but things do not go our way!   
This is one way of approaching God! To look at him as someone who can "Save"  
us!   
The other way of looking at God is someone who stays with us, gives us a  
support... is with us ! When everything is going wrong, some one remains with  
us! When i am ill, my body is leaving, my heart is stopping, my mind is not  
functioning fine. .. every faculty is disturbed. .. perhaps i am not able to  
breathe properly. .. All our relatives are eagerly waiting. .. "outside" this  
body. .. looking at it helplessly. .. only God stays "With" you!   
He may not really help you out! Why, i do not know! He is There! As the  
Silence within. .. and the suffering which started has to come to an end some  
day! The Silence within, is God. The Silence within... mute spectator... is  
There with you! through your suffering! The suffering cannot be eliminated,   
perhaps! or perhaps it can be! I really do not know! God is that Friend who is  
there with you! Who is with You ! You can say "I do not need such a God". ..  
he still is there!   
Love!   
Silence

people who has faith also are suffering, but some people scold god for not  
saving them during the suffering. But god will take care two of these people  
in same manner.   
"A" who has faith on God, understands even we hate or scold God never leaves  
anybody because He has unconditional love. On the other hand "B" who scolds  
God for his own suffering cannot run from God. For both of them God only gives  
the mind but one person's mind works in positive way another one's works in  
negative way.   
When they ask me I cannot explain them why God simply watches their suffering.  
If I say, it is our past karma they say, they do not want such a god.I do not  
know how to explain them.   
The same God should come tell them in front of them.   
Does this faith come out of practice or habit? Whatever it may be for total  
surrender we need Bhakti. For having bhakti we should have faith. This faith  
also we should nurture it day by day without fail, that what I believe.

Grace is karuna, the female concorporate of Siva in Saiva Siddhantam. But in   
Advaita, Grace is the very nature of Brahman. Bhagavan Ramana uses the word   
Karunai, Grace, in Sri Arunachala Padigam, Verse 1. Christians name their  
girl   
children as Grace, Mercy etc.,

Dear I,   
Don't worry about all these experiences, they are very normal for all kinds of  
aspirants of Truth all over across religions. It is sure mark of progress and  
it is very evident that Grinding is happening. Let it all happen, just remain  
observant to all these happenings. Whether it is a pleasant or divine  
experience or a painful or suffering experience, just be aware of it. Life is  
all about experiencing. Experience it all in absolute fullness. Like the  
passing cloud it will all fade away.   
Even if you don't get sleep, its ok, its pretty normal, don't force yourself  
to sleep, that will complicate the matter, you are not getting sleep, its a  
genuine expression, just accept the situation and spend the time in a way that  
will lift you, say read good books or something that will give you peace.   
Patience is the key, Like Ramana, Shirdi Sai Baba's main teaching is Shraddha  
and Saburi or patience. nothing happens in a day, month and year. Let the  
nature take its own time. In the mean time, just willingly joyfully bear or  
put up with all problems and sufferings and spiritual ups and downs in a  
positive way.   
One thing is assured, as the grinding has started, there is only one way, the  
way upwards - towards knowledge. You will soon see the light of knowledge and  
Ramana and it will all be clear then.   
Just hold on...   
Take it easy...   
Whatever happens, happens for your good, we just don't know. Bhagavan Ramana  
has said, we always thank God for all the Good that happens to us, but He asks  
do we thank God for all Bad things that happen to us? We think what is good  
only based on a small limited mind of ours, we decide as to what is good and  
and what is bad, But many things that we think good and when then don't happen  
to us, then know that that Good thing that we thought was actually bad for us.  
And somethings that we consider Bad will eventually turn out to be Good, when  
it is all clear as to why it happened!   
Remember these words of Bhagavan: The Ordainer controls the fate of souls in accordance to their destiny. What  
ever is bound NOT TO HAPPEN, will not happen, TRY AS YOU MAY, and whatever is  
BOUND TO HAPPEN, WILL HAPPEN, do what you may to prevent it. The best course,  
therefore is to remain silent.   
Experience Life, till Life offers experience to you, on the hand, keep up what  
you are doing, just don't worry about your disappointments, they will all fade  
away like the passing cloud.   
If you notice carefully, there is one thing absolutely unchanged, just focus  
and and you will see that it is the 'SEER' who is narrating all these detail,  
the one that is aware of all things and happenings. See if that is changing!  
That which is aware of changes is the real YOU. Find out that YOU. Who am I to  
whom all these appearances and changes, dreams, illusions, various experiences  
are arising to.   
Thats all I can say... from my own small experiences...   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear arunaja,   
Perseverence is the key. Do not despair. Many people have told Bhagavan   
Ramana that when they were coming for third or fourth time to Arunachala,   
their ego got only bigger. This happens. Because the ego/mind fights   
its last battle to keep you under its control. Go past these desparations.   
Ramana is the Truth. Only the ego/mind which tries to do magic with   
you is fake.   
Arunachala Siva.

I lost faith many times because of suffering in life,   
and everytime I came back with firmer faith than before.   
I hope you come back with firmer and deeper faith in the future.   
Quote: Bhagavan: It is good if suffering comes to devotees.   
.....All sufferings are given for the sole purpose of purifying the mind of  
the devotees.   
If we are patient, hapiness will follow.

Dear arunraja,   
I shall tell you a happening in my life. My mother was a great   
devotee of Satya Sai Baba. She used to fast full day on Thrusdays.   
My sister, at a young age of 29, died suddenly due to some mis-   
management of a surgery. The corpse came from the hospital.   
Mother and everyone else cried, cried. My mother then took out   
the photographs of Satya Sai Baba, (glass-framed) and threw them   
on the floor! After one year, she went back to Satya Sai Baba.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear arunaja,   
 This happens very often when the time is really tough, we seek God's help! We want God to save us from it! But somehow it does not work out! May be we cry and pleed but things do not go our way!   
This is one way of approaching God! To look at him as someone who can "Save"  
us!   
The other way of looking at God is someone who stays with us, gives us a  
support... is with us ! When everything is going wrong, some one remains with  
us! When i am ill, my body is leaving, my heart is stopping, my mind is not  
functioning fine. .. every faculty is disturbed. .. perhaps i am not able to  
breathe properly. .. All our relatives are eagerly waiting. .. "outside" this  
body. .. looking at it helplessly. .. only God stays "With" you!   
He may not really help you out! Why, i do not know! He is There! As the  
Silence within. .. and the suffering which started has to come to an end some  
day! The Silence within, is God. The Silence within... mute spectator... is  
There with you! through your suffering! The suffering cannot be eliminated,   
perhaps! or perhaps it can be! I really do not know! God is that Friend who is  
there with you! Who is with You ! You can say "I do not need such a God". ..  
he still is there!   
Love!   
Silence

people who has faith also are suffering, but some people scold god for not  
saving them during the suffering. But god will take care two of these people  
in same manner.   
"A" who has faith on God, understands even we hate or scold God never leaves  
anybody because He has unconditional love. On the other hand "B" who scolds  
God for his own suffering cannot run from God. For both of them God only gives  
the mind but one person's mind works in positive way another one's works in  
negative way.   
When they ask me I cannot explain them why God simply watches their suffering.  
If I say, it is our past karma they say, they do not want such a god.I do not  
know how to explain them.   
The same God should come tell them in front of them.   
Does this faith come out of practice or habit? Whatever it may be for total  
surrender we need Bhakti. For having bhakti we should have faith. This faith  
also we should nurture it day by day without fail, that what I believe.

Grace is karuna, the female concorporate of Siva in Saiva Siddhantam. But in   
Advaita, Grace is the very nature of Brahman. Bhagavan Ramana uses the word   
Karunai, Grace, in Sri Arunachala Padigam, Verse 1. Christians name their  
girl   
children as Grace, Mercy etc.,   
Arunachala Siva.

I must have to tell this to evryone keen on ramana. I want to echo my  
feelings and dispointments to evryone here.   
I have dedicated myself to ramana and many times I have seen him in deep  
sleep.. (i wont call it has a sleep..kind of trance state. .I go to bed  
assuming that I will sleep after sometime but it is not a sleep.).I have lost  
my sleep long back.. It is something different feeling. .I used to expereince  
...   
so many things I heard from him. .but nothing has happend till date. . I  
wonder is this something wrong with me...   
or ramana's grace is fake..?.. I don't know - what happened to me..?. .A good  
sprit has caputured me...? or is it a fake one..   
I dont know - How many ppl suffering like this kind of phobia.?..... I have  
lost all the faith in ramana....and I am sure not hurting any devotee of  
ramana. But I have every right in telling everyone this.
