**http://ramanujamchats.blogspot.com/2009/02/gold-wrapping-paper.html**   
The story goes that some time ago a mother punished her five year old daughter  
for wasting a roll of expensive gold wrapping paper.Money was tight and she  
became even more upset when the child used the gold paper to decorate a box to  
put under the Christmas tree.Nevertheless, the little girl brought the gift  
box to her mother the next morning and then said, "This is for you, Momma."   
The mother was embarrassed by her earlier over reaction, but her anger flared  
again when she opened the box and found it was empty. She spoke to her  
daughter in a harsh manner. "Don't you know, young lady, when you give someone  
a present there's supposed to be something inside the package?" She had tears  
in her eyes and said, "Oh, Momma, it's not empty! I blew kisses into it until  
it was full."   
The mother was crushed. She fell on her knees and put her arms around her  
little girl, and she begged her forgiveness for her thoughtless anger.   
An accident took the life of the child only a short time later, and it is told  
that the mother kept that gold box by her bed for all the years of her life.   
 **Whenever she was discouraged or faced difficult problems she would open the  
box and take out an imaginary kiss and remember the love of the child who had  
put it there.   
In a very real sense, each of us, as human beings, have been given a Golden  
box filled with unconditional love and kisses from our children, family,  
friends and GOD.   
There is no more precious possession anyone could hold.**

In life, a lesson learned in your past that you will never forget  
completely.When I was in elementary school, I got into a major argument with a  
boy in my class. I have forgotten what the argument was about, but I have  
never forgotten the lesson learned that day.   
I was convinced that "I" was right and "he" was wrong - and he was just as  
convinced that "I" was wrong and "he" was right.   
The teacher decided to teach us a very important lesson. She brought us up to  
the front of the class and placed him on one side of her desk and me on the  
other. In the middle of her desk was a large, round object. I could clearly  
see that it was black. She asked the boy what color the object was. "White,"  
he answered.   
I couldn't believe he said the object was white, when it was obviously black!  
Another argument started between my classmate and me, this time about the  
color of the object.   
The teacher told me to go stand where the boy was standing and told him to  
come stand where I had been. We changed places, and now she asked me what the  
color of the object was. I had to answer, "White." It was an object with two  
differently colored sides, and from his viewpoint it was white. Only from my  
side was it black.   
 **My teacher taught me a very important lesson learned that day: You must  
stand in the other person 's shoes and look at the situation through their  
eyes in order to truly understand their perspective. **

Dear prasanth,   
On the one side, it is mind and on the other side it is the Atman.   
Arunachala Siva.
