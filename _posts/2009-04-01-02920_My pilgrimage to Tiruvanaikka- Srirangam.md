Last week of march 2009 i had visited Srirangam and Tiruvaniakka.   
First i visited Srirangam and when around the temple visited Ramanuja  
sannathi, and then headed for Tiruvaniakka, the temple for the first time i  
visited this temple and it simply super. The temple is really massive in size,  
although the gopurams are not that tall, sizable it smaller than Srirangam.  
both the temple simply great

Sri Rangam is the most important temple for Sri Vaishnavites. It is   
simply called Kovil, the Temple. Saivites use the word the Temple,   
for Chidambaram, Thillai. I was in Tiruchirapalli for many years of   
my college life. My father was working in Tiruchirapalli. Every   
Saturday, we used to go to Sri Rangam without fail. Our first visit was to  
Sri Chakrathazhwar, Sri Sudarsana temple, at the entrance of the main temple,  
to the left, as you enter. I had some "bad period"   
according to astrologers and they recommended worship of Sri   
Sudrarsana on Saturdays, with ghee lamps! This worked! I passed   
my graduation in first class, with 4th rank in the University of Madras. I  
also visited Tiruvanaikka, the Jala Linga, the Linga representing Water  
principle. The goddess there, Akhilandeswari is   
a very powerful deity. My father used to walk to Tiruvanaikka, a   
distance of about 5 kms, across the Kaveri bridge, and visit the deity on  
every Friday evening. The Linga, Jambukeswara is of a very small stature,  
about 1 foot high, always immersed in water! The water will be there on any  
day, whether rains or no rains.   
Those were the years where darshan was free for everyone. No tickets, no  
special darshan concepts. I cherish my memories of these temples. I visited  
Tiruchirapalli/Sri Rangam/Tiruvanaikka after about 15 years subsequently!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear munagala,   
Yes. Goddess Akhilandeswari was said to be an ugra-devata, a fierce   
deity, punishing anyone immediately in that part of the country.   
Adi Sankara made thadanga, ear studs and drew the deity's ugara   
into them and made her wear them! Sri Chandrasekhara Saraswathi,   
the Kanchi Pontiff, renewed that thadangas in 1980s. Tiruvanaikka   
has got an old Veda Patasala which teaches Saiva songs like Tevaram   
and Tiruvachakam too. That Vedapatasala students are much sought after  
because of their erudite knowledge in Vedas and Tamil prayers.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Karthikeyan,   
There are millions of astrologers in and around all cities of India. If you  
ask me, out of my own experiences I would suggest you not to check with  
astrologers about your future. Just let it be, Let it come, Pray and hope for  
the best, live every moment in excitement. I was fortunate to meet a great  
Jnani/Sanyasi/astrologer who was more than 105 yrs old some 3 years ago. He  
was a Trikalajnani. He was able to tell everything about me and others in my  
family, even the description of my house, location and also ow much money one  
has in his pocket. He is no more. But he told us one thing, in spite of he  
himself being an astrologer, knower of Jyothisha Shastra, He advised us all  
not to visit any astrologer as Astrology is false and don't believe in it.  
Rather, Believe in God, Put faith in God. He said every moment, the Fate of a  
person changes based on the Karmas that he performs.   
On the other hand, if it is out of excitement, to know about this great  
science etc... if you really wish you could try it. As per my understanding,  
even in the days of the yore, the great Sages never used predictive astrology  
for any humans unless the circumstances really needed them. Astrology  
originated from Astronomy. No where in the Vedas is anything mentioned about  
predictive astrology. Infact, Here in Karnataka, where most Rig Vedis live,  
they even don't have this Rahu Kalam, Yama Kandam, etc... This was testified  
by my Veda Teacher, who is very well versed and a very learned man. This thing  
originated only in recent era mostly from the Tamil Nadu. Infact, the real  
Vedic tradition one should not even look for Horoscope matches, He said in  
olden days they used to only look at the family, their traditions and values  
in search of grooms or bridegrooms. a girl and boy used to marry only for the  
sole reason to carry out the Vedic traditions, to live life the VEdic way. To  
uphold the VEdic Dharma. Today, marriage has become convinience. Off course,  
times have changed, not to criticize.   
I also suggest you to read further, Sri Ramana's teachings,   
Once a devotee asked Bhagawan :What is my future?   
First Bhagavan said, Why does he bother about the   
future and not the present? Later he added: Tell him his   
future will be as his present is.   
If you know the present you will know the   
future. It is strange that people dont want to know about the   
present, about whose existence nobody can have any doubt,   
but are always eager to know about the past or the future,   
both of which are unknown.   
on another occasion: D.: What is the best thing to do for ensuring the future?   
M.: Take care of the present, the future will take care of itself.   
Another one   
What do they all mean? Leave alone what they say of   
the past or of the future; for it is only speculative. But the present   
existence is within the experience of all. Realise the pure Being.   
There is an end to all discourses and disputes.   
Nagaraj

Dear karthikeyan. M   
If you still want to see an astrologer, in spite of what munagala has   
informed you, you may visit Sri Rangam, where within that town,   
there are many astrologers. They are good at their profession.   
In Chennai city, you may visit Abhirampuram - Gurukulam. They   
will also guide you to an astrologer in the nearby Mylapore area.   
If you visit Bangalore, there is no one to beat B.V. Raman's family   
(B.V. Raman is no more) who are all professional astrologers.   
They will cast the horoscopes in their own office and tell you   
predictions. They will not take the horoscope that you take.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Munagala,   
Yes, in olden days Brahmins had to learn Astrology as a part of their  
learning. But their learning was more duty bound i.e. for making Yagnas,  
Homas, to determine the good time/Nakshatras for Homas.   
Astronomy examines the position of the planets and other heavenly bodies. It  
does not concern itself with how they affect the life of the world or the  
individual. It is not its function to find out how far the celestial bodies  
are beneficial to us or how they may be made favourable to us. Such functions  
belong to astrology. Jyotisa includes both astronomy and astrology.   
Telling us about the results of performing a ritual at a given time, keeping  
in mind the position of the planets, the sun and the moon and the naksatras (  
asterisms ), comes under the purview of astrology. The hours favourable to the  
performance of Vedic rites are determined according to calculations based on  
the movement of planets. All this entails mathematical work.   
The measurements of the place where a sacrifice is to be conducted  
(yajnabhumi) are based on certain stipulations. These must be strictly adhered  
to if the sacrifices is to yield the desired benefits. Mathematics developed  
in this way as a handmaid to the Vedic dharma.   
 \- Sri Chandrashekhara Saraswathi (Kanchi Paramacharyal, in Deivathin Kural)   
The predictive astrology only came in recent era. Only under some undue  
circumstances would one look into the predictive astrology. Like when a new  
King is to be throned, or some cases when the Acharyal is looking for a  
successor. It was only used in such circumstances. Only in recent era people  
have come to believe Horoscope reading as Vedic Astrology. etc... its all mis  
interpreted.
