That much we can do, for whether we like it or not, the quality of life we  
need to foster as a part of global   
community depends on the nobility of our aspiration and willingness to  
cooperate with harmonious intent   
in furtherance of the cherished aim of establishing a society ruled by the  
sane principles of justice and freedom.   
And to celebrate whatever is true and and of good report, whatever it may be  
unearthed, is the best way to ease   
our pain and remove the heavy stone that blocks the source of creativity  
within us.   
It is a tall order, but such a decisive action as making a solemn pledge to  
honor everything in our experience   
is enough to allow the waters of Life to flow unencumbered -- and then all can  
be renewed in beauty depsite   
inevitable hardship as we face up to our responsibilities with fresh courage.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
