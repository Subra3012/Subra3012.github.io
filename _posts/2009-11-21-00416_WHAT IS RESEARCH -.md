## Am I Close To Realization ?

I have not been practicing for very long but sometimes I feel I am close to  
reaching the Absolute.   
(Right now I am speaking on the basis of the memories I have of a meditation  
that occurred a few minutes ago)   
It was strange, I was not really trying. .. just mucking about. .. but I  
descended through myself and saw the core, still, like a crysal or mirror,  
without any properties, there is something, without any properties.   
And I suddenly realised that I don't exist, that my thoughts/feelings/actions  
and the person they seem to imply does not exist. I didn't think it -- I just  
suddenly realised it.   
The guides (gurus) say that you don't need to go anywhere, that you are  
already here. This has been very difficult to understand. How can I already  
be here ? But a minute ago, I understood, I saw it. Suddenly I just saw it to  
be true.   
Am I close ? How can I be close, I have not done much training ? I have been  
meditating a little bit for 2 years, not much, just for relaxation.   
Sometimes I feel like I could walk through to the Absolute. It would not be  
hard. But there is fear. The body has fear. But I see the Absolute ahead.   
And when I come out of the meditation (like now). .. I am uncertain again of  
what I saw, my mind thinks it is a joke. But I am scared now, shaking a bit.  
But I know - I saw it. I saw it. I saw it. Feel quite scared.   
Should I say goodbye to my friends if I am to go through, will I know them  
after ? Will they know me ?

Dear rideforever,   
It is a remarkable improvement. Please pursue. One can   
live the same life, with friends, wife and children. No harm.   
Arunachala Siva.

I am not fit to reply to this. Yet I want to make one caution. An initiation given by the Silent Guru or an awakening should not be regarded as the culmination of sadhana. A few years ago my wife, who has no spiritual inclinations, had accompanied me to Ramana Ashram. Before entering the old hall I told her to sit and watch her mind and to remain there as long as comfortable. Later she told me that she had a strange experience in the old hall; for a moment everything had disappeared and she had been in an indescribable peaceful state! I became very glad that she received silent initiation from the Maharshi - who can doubt His presence there?   
 The state of realization is beyond all doubts. So the enquiry must be pursued till all doubts are cleared. The following quote from Talk 53 may be useful: D.: Is not Maharshi aware of himself and his surroundings, as clearly   
as I am?   
M.: To whom is the doubt? The doubts are not for the realised. They   
are only for the ignorant.

Some pointers are given in scriptures and sayings of saints regarding that  
state.   
\- It is full of bliss   
\- It is most natural   
\- No agency or ego is present in that stillness...it is Impersonal...it is as  
it exists   
\- Independent of the body...In that state one gets convinced that one is not  
the body...It can exist even without the body...but body cannot exist without  
It   
\- Independent of the mind...It can exist even without any thought  
appearing...but thoughts cannot exist without It being present   
\- There is no tinge of sorrow in It   
\- No more wants after that...the state is self-evident and  
natural...verification is not required to convince oneself (for the simple  
reason that there is no verifier to get convinced)...nothing further is  
required to be gained after that...nothing further is required to be lost  
after that...   
It is the simple natural state of Being.   
It is the Spiritual Sky.

I have been reading all realised people's books. All talked same subject. It  
is pity that I could not understand that before some time.   
But now only I understood what is heart and mind. All the scenes, devi deva"s  
darshan, some voices are all mind's play. That moment only it looks so   
real but after two days, we cannot bring out the same scenes. When it happens  
from the heart I think it never changes. We need not to speak or do anything.   
People would understand what we want to speak. And without our effort things  
are being done. It is my poor understanding after all these years.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Mind is Jiva or the individual soul. (Who am I?). When we   
listen to the mind, we invariably err. The Heart is the centre   
where the Self is "felt" within the body for seekers. What   
Heart says is the Truth. The term "Summa Iru" of Bhagavan   
Ramana is the silence of the mind, the silence of the Jiva.   
In that silence, the Heart's grace flows.   
Arunachala Siva.

very nice explaination. When the jiva is mind, then all the actions must be  
false. The mind never pay the attention to the heart. Why does   
not the heart over rule the mind?. I think for many lifes the habit formed on  
the mind to over rule the heart. Suddenly the same mind starts to think   
who thinks, why does it think, from where the thoughts are coming, these types  
of questions if it is genuine the same mind starts reading spiritual books,  
and searching for gurus. The real guru says, try to find out the answer  
within. That time only the real heart starts its functioning. As you say   
the heart is within jiva for so long. But sometime it is rather difficult to  
find out whether mind acts or heart acts.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. Due to vasanas that have come with the Jiva from many   
many previous births make us act as the mind dictates and not   
as per the Heart's command. It is like a chimney lamp having   
dirt all over the enclosing glass, that the Light is never seen!   
Our job is to clean up the chimney glass first. This is called   
Chidda Suddhi. Prayers, mantra japa, good karmas, yoga practices   
\-- all these help and can be done simultaneously with self enquiry.   
Arunachala Siva.

If absolute stillness is felt as the core and the mind as periphery, it is  
more progress.   
If mind is felt as core and absolute stillness as "holes" of bliss, it is less  
progress.

Research ia an attempt to bring the mysteries of unknown into the field of  
known.It is physical.   
Religion is a science to develop the art of dissolving the known in the  
unknowable.It is spiritual.

Research is to search into something that has already been searched hence re-  
search

Dear Sankar and others,   
Research is searching outside, for something unknown, through   
books, lab equipments etc., This is fruitless, without searching   
the known, inside. If you know the Heart, you know everything   
in the world. That is how Bhagavan was able to explain the   
theory of relativity to a questioner, who was having a lot of   
book knowledge!   
Arunachala Siva.
