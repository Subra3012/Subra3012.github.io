## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Om Gan Ganapatye Namah - meaning and purpose

This is the mul mantra of Lord Ganesh (also called Ganapathi, Vinayaka,  
Vigneshwar). This mantra is said to have the power to remove all evil and  
obstacles.   
 **Origin of the mantra**   
This mantra was first mentioned in Ganapati Atharvarshisha. Ganapati  
Atharvarshisha is said to have been written by Atharva Rishi after he had the  
darshan of Ganapti.   
It is related to Lord Ganeshji. In simple words, it is mool mantra(basic  
chant) of Lord Ganesh.   
Om means universal sound, gam is invocation to Lords shakti (energy) and  
ganapatayae namah means bow to Lord of the world.   
 **What does it mean?**   
Om Gan Ganapatye Namah means the devotee bows/ offers salutations to the Lord  
of the World.   
 **How to pronounce it?**   
There are quite a few ways over how this mantra should be written, especially  
its second word gam. And various authorities stress over different  
pronunciations.   
Here are some ways of pronunciation: Om gan ganapatye namah   
Om gam ganapatye naman   
Om gung ganapatye namah   
Whatever the pronunciation, the meaning is always the same.   
This mantra removes all evil and obstacles that prevent you from reaching your  
goals.   
Chanting the mantra just after bath is very good or very early morning is  
extremely beneficial.

## Finding Self

Dear I's   
Bhagavan always guided devoteed to find their Self through Self Enquiry.   
I just felt, practicing compassion, Samatvam among fellows would lead to the  
Self (faster) and spread compassion. It is becomming more and more alive every  
moment, even feeling for the ants that are running around on your floor,  
becomming aware as to not stamp them, feeding the hungry animals and spreading  
only compassion - Samatva. not hurtiung people around us, not hurting them for  
their stupidity, allowing the process of grinding to take place on its own and  
not impossing the so understood gained knowledge upon them, etc... bearing  
insults and not responding back with hate, not fighting, beiung ever slow and  
compassionate like Bhagavan Ramana himself.   
Remembering each moment how Bhagavan would react to this moment and imbibing  
Ramana Consciousness is the way   
Self Enquiry and its discussion should be purely internal, and its analysis  
are not going to take any one closer to Self but only breeds discussions after  
discussion.   
Be Compassionate.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
Nice post. In the lives and teachings of saints, compassion is observed to be  
a part of them. Also the principles of Karma Yoga is based on compassion. By  
practising self-enquiry compassion develops; also by practising compassion  
self-enquiry develops, since self is at the base of both of them.   
Swami Vivekananda said: Learn to feel yourself in other bodies, to know that we are all one. Throw all  
other nonsense to the winds. Spit out your actions, good or bad, and never  
think of them again. What is done is done. Throw off superstition. Have no  
weakness even in the face of death. Be free.   
Jiddu Krishnamurthy said: You may have read a great deal, be capable of great arguments and of solving  
problems, but the problem-solving mind is not the intelligent mind.  
Intelligence comes with compassion, with love. And when that intelligence is  
an action of compassion it is global, not a particular action.

Dear grhluna,   
Very nice poem about Shirdi Sai Baba.   
I remember my trip to Shirdi several years back.   
Inside the hotel, the first thing in the early morning was the Aarti of Sai  
Baba.   
The Aarti was being played in a music system with electrically-operated drums  
and cymbals.   
Many hotels and homes will play the Aarti of Sai Baba and the entire  
atmosphere reverberates with the name of Sai Baba. The entire township of  
Shirdi is built with Sai Baba as the spiritual center. The samadhi of Sai Baba  
draws lot of crowd and the white marble statue of Sai Baba is as if alive.

I had an uncle of mine who spent his entire life performing spiritual  
practices.   
Spirituality was as if his hobby, which he seemed to enjoy immensely.   
He told me one thing which I found to be the most useful.   
He told that when you pray or practice spiritual disciplines related to one  
guru (a true sadguru), all other gurus come to help you. The concept was also  
close to my heart. I imagined that when I pray for Krishna, Christ will also  
come to help me and so on.   
I asked myself, "Should I accept the help of another guru?"   
An answer came, "If you are in great distress and pray to Christ, and Krishna  
comes to help you, will you accept?"   
Obviously yes.   
So true gurus are like a galaxy of stars.   
Together they operate and shed spiritual lights from multiple planes.

If the foundation of spirituality is the underlying self, one will never get  
lost. ..   
if the foundation is something else, with every outward expression there are  
chances of getting lost.   
In this connection I remember the teachings of Swami Vivekananda.   
Swami Vivekananda has said about four Yogas - Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Jnana  
Yoga and Raja Yoga.   
If one reads each book, during reading one will feel that, that Yoga is best.   
Swami Vivekananda used to put his entire heart behind anything he did.   
If one reads his words about patriotism, one will feel that patriotism is the  
best, or if one reads about his words on service, one will feel that service  
is the best.   
But underlying all his sayings was the base: have Shraddha and perform  
activities in a Self-Conscious manner.   
Every work is to bear an outward result. But without self-consciousness, one  
gets attached to the outward result of the work and gets lost. Work done with  
self-consciousness is like self-enquiry itself. Here the underlying awareness  
is primary and the results of work secondary.

where do you look for yourself ? how many miles away from yourself are you ?   
you are already yourself, here, now. you are already truth. ... you have  
only to stop believing you are not.

Dear Beloved Abstract,

we are.   
Arunachala Siva.
