57. I am awareness, I am awareness. The mind is one's own - there is no doubt of this. Te form of the   
world is only consciousness. Siva, the bestower of auspiciousness,is only  
consciousness.   
58\. The form of sky is only consciousness. The chief of hosts is only  
consciousness. The form of the world   
is only consciousness. The motion of the world is only consciousness.   
59. The form of heart is only consciousness. The master of the heart is only consciousness. The form   
of the immortal is only consciousness. The basis of movement is only  
consciousness.   
60. I am only consciousness. Only awareness am I; full of consciousness, filled with awareness ever.   
True faith is only consciousness. The contemplation of Brahman is only  
consciousness.   
61. The Supreme Lord is only consciousness. The heart shrine is only consciousness. Every form is   
only consciousness. The assemblage of people is only consciousness.   
62. All joy is only consciousness. Sweet speech is only consciousness. You are only consciousness.   
I am just awareness. All is just consciousness only.   
Contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
