Kaivalya: (This article is from Mountain Path, Aradhana 2005 issue.)   
*   
Kaivalya: Sanskrit - aloofness; aloneness; isolation.   
*   
In the context of Bhagavan's teachings this means 'solitude' or the state of  
Self Realization where   
nothing exists apart from the Self. According to the scriptures, it means  
complete detachment from   
the material world.   
The Yoga Darshana defines it thus: 'When the purity of contemplation equals  
the purity of the indivdual,   
there is isolation' The Sankhya Darshana sees it as an aloofness from primal  
Nature (Prakruti) and   
all its transformations. There is no pain or pleasure in this state. The  
immediate cause for this absolute   
detachment is discriminating knowledge (Viveka).   
When the Jeeva (the individual soul), merges in its source, Atman (Absolute  
Unconditioned Awareness,   
the Self) in the Heart, and loses itself to become one with It, then That  
Alone Exists. This state of   
subtle experience is Kaivalya. (See Preface to Ramana Jnana Bodham, by  
Muruganar, Volume 2).   
In the classical example of a pot existing in Space, the pot-space is defined  
by the pot shell. When the   
pot is moved, the pot space appears to move. But is this the case? Space is  
all pervasive and thus   
exists everywhere, in and through the pot shell also. The pot is a limited  
form. Therefore it can be   
moved away from here to there. But space is everywhere. So how can space  
move and to where?   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.

The physical space is perceived by the mind through the eyes exists in mental  
space. 'And where does   
the concept of space exist? In our absolute unlimited awareness, our Self or  
Atman.' (Atma Vidya Verse 5).   
says Bhagavan. '   
The entire cosmos, including space, is pervaded by this Chitakasa, our  
omnipresent Being and omniscient   
Knowing. Chitakasa is therefore, is called, subtler than the subtlest.' and  
greater than the greatest'   
since nothing exists apart from from it. (GVK V. 498).   
Furthermore, Bhagavan describes this as 'the infinite expanse of Grace.'  
(Eleven Verses, Verse 6).   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.

Bhagavan tries to describe, for our sake, what really cannot be described"  
'The Sage established in the Heart   
does not know anything as the substratum for the entire universe except the  
Self. Like the screen which   
supports the manifestation of the images in a film show, the Self allows the  
appearance of manifestation and   
the existence of the entire universe comprising sentient beings and insentient  
matter in It. (Guru Vachaka   
Kovai, Verse 450.)   
Therefore, He can declare, 'I am all that exists'. He can also say that 'I  
am' is all alone (the state of kaivalya),   
since nothing exists apart from from Him.   
Bhagavan expresses these ideas in this verse: 'Immaculate Arunachala! The  
entire cosmos comprising   
the five elements and the manifestations of sentient beings and insentient  
matter is not apart from You,   
the Chitakasa, (absolute unlimited awareness). Then how can 'I' exist as an  
individual self apart from you?   
When You shine as Chitakasa in the Heart, swallowing up every thing, how can  
this 'I' emerge as an individual   
self? Make me merge into my source and thus reveal Your real nature (to me).  
(Eleven Stanzas, Verse 7).   
When the rising wave identifies with its form it forgets the identity with the  
ocean. This is regained only   
when it dissolves back into the source, the ocean.   
Confirmation of this comes from Sri Muruganar speaking of his own experience: 'Omnipresent Being   
and omniscient Knowing, all pervasive state of Siva, (where nothing exists  
apart), is alone Kaivalya.   
Praised be Bhagavan who bestowed this state on this undeserving person.  
(Ramana Jnana Bodham,   
Volume 2, Verse 1026).   
concluded.   
Arunachala Siva.
