## Maha Kavi Subrahmanya Bharati's Death Anniversary - 11.09.2014  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: September 11, 2014, 09:33:21 AM

Today is Maha Kavi Subrahmanya Bharati's death anniversary. He was born on  
11th December 1882, as a son of   
Chinnaswami Iyer and Lakshmi Ammal in Ettayapuram, near Tirunelvli. His name  
was Subrahmanya or Subbiah.   
He was given the title of Bharati in 1893, by the poets of Ettayapuram  
Samasthanam.   
One verse by him to remember him: வானில் பறக்கின்ற புள் எல்லாம் நான்   
 மண்ணில் திரியும் விலங்கெலாம் நான்   
கானில் வளரும் மரம் எலாம் நான்   
 காற்றும் புனலும் கடலுமே நான்.   
I am the birds that are flying in the sky. I am the animals that roam on the  
earth. I am the trees that grow in forests.   
I am the air, water and ocean.   
This verse reminds me of Sri Bhagavan's verse in Arunachala Pancharatnam,  
Verse 5.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks Subramanina Sir for this reminder. Friends, Though all such Mahant's  
may have such death days, it would be most appropriate to recognise that there  
really isn't any death day really, for one and all are but only the children  
of immortality!   
Immortality   
[C.S. Bharati]   
A thousand voices have declared it of old and some are proclaiming it to-day,  
but still it is not an ?old truth?. It is very new, this truth of  
?immortality?. May millions declare it, and many millions of millions realize  
it, in all the worlds.   
Man can make himself immortal here on earth by making his personality one with  
the Soul of the Universe. This unification can be achieved by the ceaseless  
exercise of Will. Collect all the life-streams and though-streams in thy  
being, making them all into a might river. Let this mighty river ever flow  
towards the Truth. And the Truth shall make thee immortal.   
The body must be prepared for holding and reflecting the light even before the  
latter is realized in the mind. This can be done by dispensing with all  
superfluities in dress and by a constant and intelligent motion of the limbs.  
We must give the body sufficient natural food, when it really requires it. We  
must keep it clean and tidy, vigorous and active. But we must never worry our  
minds about it, never entertain any fears on its behalf, and never release our  
complete mastery over it. Life can be made electric, thoughts luminous, and  
soul joyous by exercising all our inner and outer faculties justly and well,  
all the while ?meditating on the Truth?.   
For a Divine Truth is the first reality of man?s experience. There is a Beauty  
in the heart of this world. All conscious things are conscious of it in  
various degrees. Indeed some may deny the All-Great of the Universe while they  
are arguing either with themselves or with others. But all have felt it. It is  
what you know as existence, life, thought, passion, aspiration or love. The  
All-Great is the foundation of the sense of reality. The world lives. It has  
therefore a life working in and though its body. It is the life of the  
Universe that the sages have glorified by the name Divine.   
Deep in the heart of Nature, there is an unending flow of harmony. Whose  
drinks of this harmony attains to immortality. Trees, stars and clods, the  
ripples on the stream and the fair minds of Brindaban-they all melt into one  
joy of life when the notes of the Divine Flute are heard. The voice of  
immortality shall make thee realize that thou art one with the dawn and the  
night, the stars and the pebbles. And yet it is this realization that a man  
must have before ever he can hear the voice of immortality.   
Self-surrender is the supreme condition of winning the universal life. Men  
will part with their wealth, their rights and even their lives, at the call of  
religion. But when you ask them to exchange their human self for the divine  
self, which is exactly what all great religions want them to do, they refuse.  
For the wine of mortality has a terrible fascination for most of us. And yet  
by flinging myself into the blazing fire of universal Reality. I do not lose  
myself. I emerge out of the ordeal, shining and deathless. Brothers and  
sisters, come let us strive to become immortals by losing ourselves in the  
Supreme Light.

Some one asked Sri Bhagavan: Has Subhramanya Bharati come and seen you?   
Sri Bhagavan said: He came many years before, when I was on the Hill. He  
did not speak to me anything. Nor did   
I speak anything to him. He stayed for sometime and then left.   
Arunachala Siva.

What a beautiful song Ramanaduliji, thanks for sharing.   
मैली चादर ओढके कैसे   
द्वार तुम्हारे आऊँ   
हे पावन परमेश्वर मेरे   
मन ही मन शरमाऊँ   
तुने मुझको जग में भेजा   
निर्मल देकर काया   
आकर के संसार में मैंने   
इसको दाग लगाया   
जनम जनम की मैली चादर   
कैसे दाग छुडाऊँ   
निर्मल वाणी पाकर तुझसे   
नाम न तेरा गाया   
नैन मून्धकर हे परमेश्वर   
कभी ना तुझको ध्याया   
मन वीणा की तारें टूटी   
अब क्या गीत सुनाऊँ   
इन पैरों से चलकर तेरे   
मंदिर कभी न आया   
जहां जहां हो पूजा तेरी   
कभी ना शीश झुकाया   
हे हरिहर मैं हार के आया   
अब क्या हार चढ़ाऊँ   
तू है अपरम्पार दयालु,   
सारा जगत संभाले   
जैसा भी हूँ, मैं हूँ तेरा,   
अपनी शरण लगाले   
छोड के तेरा, द्वारा डाटा,   
और कहीं नहीं जावूँ   
 Maili Chaadar Odhke Kaise   
Dwaar Tumhaare Aaoon   
Hey Paavan Parameshwara Mere   
Man Hi Man Sharmaaoon   
Tune Mujhko Jag Me Bhejaa   
Nirmal Dekar Kaayaa   
Is Sansaar Me Aakar Maine   
Isko Daag Lagaaya   
Janam Janam Ki Maili Chaadar   
Kaise Daag Chudaaoon   
Nirmal Vaani Paakar Tujhse   
Naam Na Teraa Gaayaa   
Nain Moondhkar He Parameshwar   
Kabhi Naa Tujhko Dhyaayaa   
Man Veena Ki Taaren Tooti   
Ab Kyaa Geeth Sunaaoon   
In Pairon Se Chal Kar Tere   
Mandir Kabhi Na Aayaa   
Jahaan Jahaan Ho Poojaa Teri   
Kabhi Naa Sees Jhukaayaa   
Hey Harihar Main Haar Ke Aayaa   
Ab Kyaa Haar Chadhaaoon   
Tu he aparampar, Dajalu,   
Sara jagat samhare   
Jesa bhi hu, me hu tera,   
Apni sharan lagale   
Chhoor ke tera, dwara data,   
Aur kehi nehi jaoo   
 _How can I present myself at Your door with a dirty shawl, Lord.   
I am completely ashamed to think of the dirty shawl I will wear   
when I come back to You, to account to You for my present deeds.   
You sent me to this world with a spotlessly clean body, free from   
the taints of evil, but I have stained it with the dirt of evil, enough   
to last for several births. How can I remove these countless stains?   
You gave me in my childhood a sweet, cuckoo like voice, along   
with a musical instrument, and requested me to sing You a song   
of love. Never have I closed my eyes to meditate on Your gracious self,   
nor have I sung Your name. Even the instrument is now broken.   
What song can I sing now?   
Never have my two feet led me to the temple of Your worship,   
nor have I ever bowed my head in acknowledgement of people   
engaged in Your worship. O God, now that I am in the last days   
of my life I am completely ruined. What gift can I now present to You?   
You are without boundaries, oh Compassionate One   
Since you are the one who takes care of all of the world/creation.   
Whichever way I am, I am (still) yours,   
Please? take me into your protection/care.   
For where can I go, after leaving your door (house). _

अखियाँ हरि दरसन की प्यासी   
देख्यो चाहत कमल नयन को   
निस दिन रहत उदासी   
अखियाँ हरि दरसन की प्यासी   
केसर तिलक, मोतिन की माला   
बृन्दाबन के बासी   
नेह लगाय त्याग गये तृन सम   
डारि गये गल फांसी   
अखियाँ हरि दरसन की प्यासी   
काहू के मन की को जानत   
लोगन के मन हासी   
सुरदास प्रभु तुम्हरे दरस   
बिन लेहों करवट कासी   
अखियाँ हरि दरसन की प्यासी   
देख्यो चाहत कमल नयन को   
निस दिन रहत उदासी   
 akhiyāɱ hari darasana kī pyāsī   
dekhyo cāhata kamala nayana ko   
nisa dina rahata udāsī   
akhiyāɱ hari darasana kī pyāsī   
kesara tilaka, motina kī mālā   
bṛndābana ke bāsī   
neha lagāya tyāga gaye tṛna sama   
ḍāri gaye gala phāṁsī

 _The eyes thirst for a vision of Hari;   
They long to see the lotus-eyed one,   
Grieving for him day and night.   
Wearing a saffron tilak and pearl garland   
And dwelling in Vrindavan,   
He gave us his love, then   
cast us aside like a blade of grass,   
Throwing a noose around our necks.   
No one knows what is in another's mind,   
There is laughter in people's hearts;   
But Lord of Surdas, without a vision of you   
we would give up our very lives._

Dear Nagaraj ji   
Thank you very much for putting this beautiful bhajan. Simple words in simple  
tune takes us somewhere rather than big aalap, kalpana swaram.   
Whenever I hear this particular song I think it is written for me only.

आने वाला पल जाने वाला है   
हो सके तो इस में   
ज़िंदगी बिता दो   
पल जो ये जाने वाला है   
एक बार यूँ मिली, मासूम सी कली   
खिलते हुए कहा   
खुश पाश मैं चली   
देखा तो यहीं हैं   
ढूँढा तो नहीं हैं   
पल जो ये जाने वाला हैं   
एक बार वक़्त से, लमहा गिरा कहीं   
वहाँ दास्तां मिली   
लमहा कहीं नहीं   
थोड़ा सा हँसाके   
थोड़ा सा रुलाके   
पल ये भी जाने वाला हैं   
 Aane Wala Pal Jaane Wala Hai   
Ho Sake To Is Mein   
Zindagi Bita Do   
Pal Jo Ye Jaane Wala Hai   
Ik Baar Yu Mili, Masoom Si Kali   
Khilte Hue Kaha   
Khush Paash Main Chali   
Dekha To Yaheen Hai   
Dhoondha To Nahi Hai   
Pal Jo Ye Jaane Wala Hai   
Ik Baar Waqt Se, Lamha Gira Kaheen   
Wahaan Daastaan Milee   
Lamha Kaheen Naheen   
Thoda Sa Hansa Ke   
Thoda Sa Rula Ke   
Pal Ye Bhi Jaane Wala Hai   
 _The incoming moment is about to go away.   
If possible,   
spend a lifetime in the present moment.   
This moment is about to pass away.   
Once I met an innocent bud.   
Blossoming, it said,   
"I'm in a state of bliss!"   
If you open your eyes, it is right here.   
If you're searching, it is not there.   
This moment is about to pass.   
Once, a moment fell from (the vastness of) time.   
A story was discovered there.   
The moment was nowhere to be found.   
Making us smile a little,   
making us weep a little,   
this moment is also going to fade away. _   
(Gulzar)

ज़िंदगी एक सफ़र है सुहाना   
यहाँ कल क्या हो किसने जाना   
हँसते गाते जहाँ से गुज़र   
दुनिया की तू परवाह न कर   
मुस्कुराते हुए दिन बिताना   
यहाँ कल क्या हो किसने जाना   
मौत आनी है आएगी इक दिन   
जान जानी है जाएगी इक दिन   
ऐसी बातों से क्या घबराना   
यहाँ कल क्या हो किसने जाना   
चाँद तारों से चलना है आगे   
आसमानों से बढ़ना है आगे   
पीछे रह जाएगा ये ज़माना   
यहाँ कल क्या हो किसने जाना   
 Zindagi Ik Safar Hai Suhana   
Yaha Kal Kya Ho Kisne Jaana   
Hanste Gaate Jahaa Se Guzar

Maut Aani Hai Aayegi Ik Din

Aisi Baato Se Kya Ghabraana

Chaand Taron Se Chalna Hai Aage   
Aasmaano Se Badhna Hai Aage

 _Life is a beautiful journey   
Who knows what will happen tomorrow   
Go through this world with laughter and singing.   
Do not worry about what others say.   
Spend your days smiling.   
Who knows what will happen tomorrow!   
Death is inevitable. Death will come some day.   
Life has to end. It will end some day.   
Why worry about these things?   
Who knows what will happen tomorrow!   
Have to walk beyond the moon and the stars.   
Have to go beyond the skies.   
The world will be left behind.   
Who knows what will happen tomorrow! _

कभी कभी भगवान् को भी भक्तों से काम पड़े ।   
जाना था गंगा पार प्रभु केवट की नाव चढ़े ॥   
अवध छोड़ प्रभु वन को धाये,   
सिया राम लखन गंगा तट आये ।   
केवट मन ही मन हर्षाये,   
घर बैठे प्रभु दर्शन पाए ।   
हाथ जोड़ कर प्रभु के आगे केवट मगन खड़े ॥   
प्रभु बोले तुम नाव चलाओ,   
अरे पार हमे केवट पहुँचाओ ।   
केवट बोला सुनो हमारी,   
चरण धुल की माया भारी ।   
मैं गरीब नैया मेरी नारी ना होए पड़े ॥   
चली नाव गंगा की धारा,   
सिया राम लखन को पार उतारा ।   
प्रभु देने लगे नाव उतराई,   
केवट कहे नहीं रागुराई ।   
पार किया मैंने तुमको, अब तू मोहे पार करे ॥   
केवट दोड़ के जल भर ले आया,   
चरण धोये चरणामृत पाया ।   
वेद ग्रन्थ जिन के गुण गाये,   
केवट उनको नाव चढ़ाए ।   
बरसे फूल गगन से ऐसे,   
भक्त के भाग्य जगे ॥   
 Kabhi Kabhi Bhagwan Ko bhi Bhagto se kaam pade,   
Jana tha Ganga par prabhu Kevat ki naav chade, (2)   
Avadh chod prabhu van ko ayee,   
Siya Ram Lakhan Ganga Tat ayee,   
Kevat man hi man harshaye,   
ghar baithe parbhu darshan payee,   
Haath jod kar prabhu ke aage kevat magan khade,   
Prabhu bole tum naav chalao,   
par hame kevat pahuchao,   
Kevat kehata suno hamari Charan dhul ki maya bhari,   
Main garib naya meri mahi na hoi pade,   
Chali naav Ganga ki Dharaa,   
Siya Ram Lakhan ko paar utara,   
prabhu dene lage naav utrai kevat kahe nahi Raghurai,   
paar kiya maine Tumko, Ab Tu mohe paar kare   
Kevat daud ke jal bhar laya,   
Charan dhoye charanamrit paya,   
ved granth jis ke yaash gaye kevat unko naav chadaye,   
barse phool gagan se aise bhakt ke bhaag bade   
The lyrics of this bhajan are beautiful and meaningful. The lyrics shows the  
deep insight the poor boatman had. It contains a short meaningful story.   
Sometimes God requires the help from the devotees. Lord Rama had to cross the  
Ganga, Shri Rama, Shri Sita Maiya and Shree Lakshman approached the banks of  
the river. They had left the Kingdom of Avadh (Ayodhya) they were suppose to  
rule.   
The mind of boatman on the river banks is filled with joy as he sees Lord Rama  
his God approaches him. With folded hands he is lost in the divine ecstasy.   
The lord asks him to carry them across to the shore. Kevat had a very  
intelligent and devotional answer for the same. He says that he will have to  
wash the feet of Shri Rama, as Shri Rama's feet had amazing powers and he the  
poor boatman would be in difficulty if his boat turns into a lady.   
This the boatman referred to an incident when a lady who was turned into a  
stone by curse was brought back to life as the holy feet of Shri Rama touched  
her stones form.   
With this excuse the kevat gets a great opportunity to wash the holy feet and  
receive the Charnamrit.   
Kevat leads the One of whom the Ved, Vedas and Granths (Sacred Texts) praises.  
The flowers falls down fro heaven as He steers the boat through the water of  
Ganges and the joy of devotion in his heart.   
He takes Shri Rama, Shree Sita and Laxhman across the shores. Across the  
shores has a spiritual and mystical or symbloic meaning. That of steering one  
across the worldly and illusory ocean of life and death to the ocean of  
SatChitAnanda the consciousness of truth consciousness and bliss. Shirdi Sai  
Baba used tera beda par ho jayega तेरा बेडा पर हो जायेगा many a times. It was  
symbolic of freeing one from the pangs of birth and death, joys and sorrows.   
When on the other banks when Shri Rama began to give the fare for the boat,  
the devotional and intelligent denied the money as the fare. He asked the  
Highest from the one who could give the highest. There a beautiful article on  
what one should ask from God. He asks for the beda par he says that since he  
steered them across the shores in return he would like Shri Rama to steer him  
across the shore too. The shore of life and death, joys, hopes, agony and  
weight.

Dear Ravi,   
Nice anecdote from Maha Sawmi.   
Today is Vinyaka Chaturthi. Vinayaka or Ganesa's celebration day falls on the  
fourth day of waxing moon every year   
in the month of Avani (Simha month).   
Kavyakanta Ganapti Muni felt that he was Ganesa and thus the elder brother of  
Sri Bhagavan. In fact,he was born by   
prayer to the Lord by his father.   
Sri Bhagavan also prays to Ganapati while beginning His Aksharamana maalai  
singing: For making a garland of wedding   
to Arunachala,. the compassionate and graceful Ganapati, You extend Your  
helping hand and protect me to complete   
these verses.   
Once He prayed to Ganapati, at the instance of Eswara Swamigal in a verse on  
the Lord at niche. (see the follwoing   
post for the verse).   
Nambi Andaar Nambi who collated the Tevaram verses was a great Ganapti  
Upasaka. It is said that Ganapati took   
the prasadam offered by extending His trunk!   
I remember only the pujas done in Tiruchirapalli, Rockfort, to Uchhip  
Pillaiyar. I have no seen Pillaiyar Patti,in Sivaganga.   
Arunachala Siva.

The following is the verse written by Bhagavan on the Ganesa in the niche: பிள்ளையாய்ப் பெற்றவனைப் பிச்சாண்டி ஆக்கி எங்கும்   
பிள்ளையாப் பேழ் வயிற்றைப் பேணினீர் \- பிள்ளையான்   
கன்நெஞ்சோ மாடத்துப் பிள்ளையாரே கண் பாரும்   
பின் வந்தான் தன்னை நீர் பெற்று.   
You have made Your father who gave birth to You, as an alms-seeker;   
You as His son everywhere took care of your large belly by eating prasadam.   
O is your heart made of stone, O Ganapati in the niche!   
Please show your gaze to me who came after You, (as Subrahmanya) and give me  
food.   
Arunachala Siva.

**Ganesa PanchaRatnam   
Ganesha Pancharatnam Stotram:-Prayer to Lord Ganesh   
Lyrics of Ganesha Pancharatnam Stotram By Adi Sankaracharya. A highly revered  
devotional prayer song to Lord Ganapathi, the destroyer of obstacles.   
The song is sung by the music queen Dr M.S.Subbalakshmi.   
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2KA-2YSz98   
GANESHA PANCHARATNAM   
Mudakaraatha Modakam Sada Vimukti Saadhakam   
Kalaadharaavatamsakam Vilasiloka Rakshakam   
Anaaya Kaika Naayakam Vinasitebha Daityakam   
Nataasubhasu Naashakam Namaami Tham Vinaayakam.   
Meaning: I prostrate before Lord Vinaayaka who joyously holds modaka in His hand, who  
bestows salvation, who wears the moon as a crown in His head, who is the sole  
leader of those who lose themselves in the world. The leader of the leaderless  
who destroyed the elephant demon called Gajaasura and who quickly destroys the  
sins of those who bow down to Him, I worship such a Lord Ganesh.   
Natetaraati Bheekaram Navoditaarka Bhaasvaram   
Namat Suraari Nirjanam Nataadhi Kaapa Duddharam   
Suresvaram Nidheesvaram Gajesvaram Ganeshvaram   
Mahesvaram Samaasraye Paraatparam Nirantaram.   
Meaning: I meditate eternally on Him, the Lord of the Ganas, who is frightening to  
those not devoted, who shines like the morning sun, to whom all the Gods and  
demons bow, who removes the great distress of His devotees and who is the best  
among the best.   
Samasta Loka Samkaram Nirasta Daitya Kunjaram   
Daredarodaram Varam Vare Bhavaktra Maksharam   
Krupaakaram Kshamaakaram Mudaakaram Yasaskaram   
Manaskaram Namaskrutaam Namaskaromi Bhaasvaram.   
Meaning: I bow down with my whole mind to the shining Ganapati who brings happiness to  
all the worlds, who destroyed the demon Gajasura, who has a big belly,  
beautiful elephant face, who is immortal, who gives mercy, forgiveness and  
happiness to those who bow to Him and who bestows fame and a well disposed  
mind.   
Akimchanaarti Marjanam Chirantanokti Bhaajanam   
Puraari Poorva Nandanam Suraari Garva Charvanam   
Prapancha Naasha Bheeshanam Dhananjayaadi Bhushanam   
Kapola Daana Vaaranam Bhajaey Puraana Vaaranam.   
Meaning: I worship the ancient elephant God who destroys the pains of the poor, who is  
the abode of Aum, who is the first son of Lord Shiva (Shiva who is the  
destroyer of triple cities), who destroys the pride of the enemies of the  
Gods, who is frightening to look at during the time of world's destruction,  
who is fierce like an elephant in rut and who wears Dhananjaya and other  
serpents as his ornaments.   
Nitaantikaanta Dantakaanti Mantakaanta Kaatmajam   
Achintya Rupa Mantaheena Mantaraaya Krintanam   
Hrudantarey Nirantaram Vasantameva Yoginam   
Tameka Danta Meva Tam Vichintayaami Santatam.   
Meaning: I constantly reflect upon that single tusked God only, whose lustrous tusk is  
very beautiful, who is the son of Lord Shiva, (Shiva, and the God of  
destruction), whose form is immortal and unknowable, who tears asunder all  
obstacles, and who dwells forever in the hearts of the Yogis.   
Mahaaganesa Pancharatnam Aadarena Yonvaham   
Prajapati Prabhaatake Hrudi Smaran Ganesvaram   
Arogatham Adoshataam Susaahitim Suputrataam   
Samaahitaayu Rastabhootim Abhyupaiti Sochiraat.   
Meaning: He who recites this every morning with devotion, these five gems about Lord  
Ganapati and who remembers in his heart the great Ganesha, will soon be  
endowed with a healthy life free of all blemishes, will attain learning, noble  
sons, a long life that is calm and pleasant and will be endowed with spiritual  
and material prosperity

**On a Ganesh Chaturthi day in l912 a potter came to the Virupaksha cave with  
a small image of Sri Ganesa that he had made and presented it to Sri Bhagavan.  
A disciple suggested that both he and Sri Bhagavan should write a verse to  
celebrate the occasion, and this is what Sri Bhagavan wrote. Interestingly  
Ramana Maharshi has followed the tradition of invoking Lord Ganesha?s Grace  
before writing Aksharamanamali.   
On the auspicious occasion of Ganseha Chaturthi we worship Lord Ganesha with  
the verses composed by Ramana Maharshi.   
 _Him, who begot you as a child, you made   
Into a beggar; as a child yourself   
You then lived everywhere just to support   
Your own huge belly. I too am a child.   
You Child God in that niche! encountering one   
Born after you, is your heart made of stone?   
I pray you look at me._   
Invocation in Aksharamanamalai by Sri Bhagavan   
 _Gracious Ganapati! with Thy (loving) hand bless me, that I may make this a  
marital garland of letters worthy of Sri Arunachala, the bridegroom!_**

It is not that one should not go anywhere near Atma-vidya unless he has  
completely purified his mind and obtained one-pointedness. If that stage has  
really been reached, there would be no more necessity to have any elaborate  
Atma-SAdhanA or regimen. The mind will then be ready to firmly establish  
itself in the teaching of the Guru and Realisation will be almost automatic.  
The Acharya Sankara has not taken all the pains to elaborate the methodlogy of  
the SAdhanA ChatushhTayaM to such a highly evolved person. If we understand  
him right, it is only this: A pure mind and the capability to be one-pointed  
are surely basic to a certain extent; with that basic equipment, one should  
read the shAstras and enter the kingly path of the SAdhanA. Only then he can  
make real progress. Otherwise he will only be touching the fringes and have a  
false feeling that he knows everything.

Atmavichar/Friends,   
This is apropos 'Organ Donation' and Kanchi Mahaswami's views as posted by  
Atmavichar in this thread: http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/forum/index.php?topic=7179.405   
As I have already stated,there may be occult reasons when someone like Kanchi  
mahaswami maintains what he does....although it may not be intelligible to our  
rational sense and social sensibilities...Came across this interesting talk by  
Dr BM Hegde: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0rRgvhNy1U   
The entire talk is an interesting one but it throws interesting light on the  
topic of organ donation....How a Heart of a 17 year old boy was transplanted  
to a 57 year old man who was a vegetarian and after the transplant,the very  
same man was asking for Non vegetarian food. ...Please fast forward to 1 hour  
34 minutes to listen to this part of the narration.   
This is only a glimpse and there may well be other ramifications to the topic  
and it is simpler to trust the wisdom of a sage in matters such as this.   
Namaskar

**Keeping the mind focused while doing worship**   
Guru ? Jagadguru Sri Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswamiji was deeply engrossed  
in the performance of Maanasa Puja to Sri Tarakeshwar. While Sri Sannidhanam  
and the Tarakeshwar Mathadhipati used the materials to offer worship, the  
Mahaswamiji had remained motionless and after an hour exclaimed with great  
satisfaction that He had worshipped the Lord by keeping Him in Ratna  
Simhasanam and offering various stotras and puja materials. The Jagadguru  
described that He had seen His Guru as an example given in the name of the  
Goddess ? Antarmukha Samaradhyaa. Hence it is essential to engage in worship  
of God without allowing the mind to wander.

**Do ?Sevai? daily?.**   
One day Periyavaa visited a Veda Padasaalai. Periyavaa always visits the  
kitchen of all Veda Padasaalai He goes to.   
He observes if the cook there, performs the cooking with affection and with  
utmost attention.   
The day which Periyavaa visited the Padasaalai, the cook was painstakingly  
preparing ?Sevai? (Rice Noodles) for the children. Instant Sevai was not  
available those days and so it took a lot of efforts to make the Sevai.   
Looking at this, Periyavaa felt incredibly happy. ?Do you do this frequently??  
asked Periyavaa. The cook replied ?I try to do as much as I can. Poor kids ?  
They are staying away from their home to learn the Vedas. So, I want to ensure  
that they get good tasty food.?   
?I am very happy! Do ?Sevai? daily!? said Periyavaa and came out of the  
kitchen. The cook was worried thinking ?This is a difficult food to cook which  
takes a lot of effort. Periyavaa is asking me to do this daily!?   
MahaSwami called the cook again and asked, ?Were you scared when I asked you  
to perform ?Sevai? daily?? The cook?s face showed his fear and he said, ?I  
will try do as much as I can?.   
Periyavaa replied with a smile ?Poor man! Looks like you got scared. This  
(Rice Noodles) is not the ?Sevai? which I meant. Everyday, you care about what  
you cook for these children and take great efforts to make them happy right?  
That?s what I meant! That?s the biggest ?Sevai? (Service)!?   
On hearing this, the cook was overjoyed, and he prostrated in front of Maha  
Periyavaa.   
Through this incident, Periyavaa indicates there is no greater service than  
cooking and serving for the children learning Vedas.

**TEACHINGS OF SHANKARACHARYA SWAMI BRAHMANANDA SARASWATI**   
You desire to live a worldly life because you have not yet had a vision  
darshan of God: one should live instead for that experience-   
When seeds are roasted there is no chance for them to sprout later. Similarly,  
when the human mind is roasted in the fire of knowledge and devotion, then  
there is no chance to return and germinate anew in the cycle of life and  
death. Therefore, try to become a devotee and knower, jnanavan.   
But don't become that type of knower who mutters, ?Sivo'ham, Sivo ?ham, om,  
om, and Aham brahmasmi, "I am Siva. I am Brahman,? and yet retains love  
samsara in wealth, women, progeny, and so on. Such superficial knowledge  
produces more harm than benefit.   
When people call themselves Brahman yet stray from dharma and karma, they lack  
sufficient strength to remain in that state. Hence, as long as you are not  
free from the love of worldly objects, do not fall into the trap of ?Brahman,?  
but instead, develop devotion to God When you practice devotion for a long  
time, greater desire, raga for Bhagavan will dawn, releasing you from the  
cycle of birth and death.

**Today is the 138th Birth Anniversary of Bhagawan Ramana Maharshi.**   
Experiences with Maha Periyava: Brahma Jnani?s There and Here Too!   
One of the Veda Pandits from Kanchipuram informed Sri Periyava that he was  
going to Tiruvannamalai and started on his journey. It did not seem that he  
mentioned the reason for his visit to Tiruvannamalai. Once he reached there,  
he had a desire to have a darshan of Sri Ramana Maharshi.   
When he reached the Ramana Ashram, he had the darshan of Sri Ramana Maharshi  
and then sat there for lunch in the ashram. He felt that the arrangement there  
was slightly different. Sri Ramana Maharshi was sitting in the centre. On one  
side of the Maharshi, they had the Veda Pandits sitting and on the other side,  
they had the foreigners who were frequently visiting the Maharshi sitting.  
This arrangement really disturbed the Pandit. As this Veda Pandit had a habit  
of eating alone in an orthodox manner, he could not accept this arrangement  
where he was made to sit along with other Pandits and foreigners together.   
Also the fact that the Veda Pandits were served sathvik food and the  
foreigners were served food with onion, increased his mental anguish. The Veda  
Pandit was unable to accept this as well and could not digest the fact that  
Sri Ramana Maharshi was sitting in the centre and having His food. As if he  
identified a big mistake in this procedure, he wanted to inform this to Sri  
Sri Sri Maha Periyava.   
He came back to the SriMatham. First and foremost, he came for Sri Maha  
Periyava?s darshan to inform all that he saw in the Ramana Ashram. Few  
devotees were surrounding Sri Periyava and before he could open his mouth to  
complain, Sri Periyava stopped him by saying, ?There is no need to tell  
anything now?let?s see it later.?   
When Sri Periyava was alone, he came back again. Now, Sri Periyava let the  
Veda Pandit talk and the Pandit stated all his complaints about the practice  
being followed in the Ashram.   
Sri Periyava, immediately asked the Veda Pandit, ?Did you go there only to see  
this?? By asking this, Sri Maha Periyava made the Veda Pandit realize his  
mistake. The Veda Pandit lost his vehemence and also realized his fault.   
?In the Sannidhi of Brahma Jnanis, there is nothing wrong or having dosham  
(erroneous). Do you know?? asked Sri Periyava.   
Even after this, Pandit was not fully satisfied. If all that was happening  
around Sri Ramana Maharshi, a Brahma Jnani, wasn?t it the same for Sri Maha  
Periyava as well, who is none other than Sakshat Sarveshwara. He thought why  
were there so many restrictions in the SriMatham?   
Sri Periyava started talking as if He understood the Veda Pandit?s thought  
process. ?You might think why it is not the case here. The practices that are  
followed here were established by Sri Adi Shankara and nobody can change or  
override it. There, that Brahma Jnani does not have any such restrictions.?   
Even though Sri Periyava stated this in a simple manner that there were  
differences between Ramana Ashram and SriMatham in the practices that were  
being followed, the Veda Pandit felt happy that he had realized the truth  
through the words of Sri Maha Periyava that a Brahma Jnani was Present There  
And Here Too!

**TEACHINGS OF SHANKARACHARYA SWAMI BRAHMANANDA**   
 **EVERY MOMENT 0F LIFE IS VERY PRECIOUS.**   
This scarce human body is acquired after eighty-four hundred thousand lives;  
don't let it go to no purpose. Every moment of life is very precious. If you  
don't understand the value of it then you will only be crying and have nothing  
in your hand.   
You have become a human being, therefore have the strength to consider what is  
said in the Scriptures, and then you can do the best purushartha (effort for  
human birthright).   
Do not think of yourself as weak and fallen. That which was done up to now,  
understand that this was unintentional. But now be cautious, apply yourself to  
doing action fit for a human. On your own accord understand what is good and  
what is bad. Take to doing that which is good and reject that which is bad.   
If having become a human being you do not obtain knowledge of Paramatma then  
understand that it is as if you have sold a diamond for the price of spinach.   
Worship of Paramatma is not for Paramatma. Worship of Paramatma is for the  
disappearance of one's suffering, disappearance of unrest and the  
disappearance of ignorance and weakness.   
Paramatma is AII-Knowing, Omnipotent and Unlimited Bliss. Worship is a way to  
get a handle on that unlimited strength. The meaning of human life is  
accomplishing this work. If no effort has been put in this direction then make  
sure you learn it by heart and understand.

**Short Messages from Sringeri Jagadgurus:**   
 **Sringeri Jagadguru narrates incident where Mahasannidhanam, Jagadguru Sri  
Sri Abhinava Vidyatirtha Mahaswamiji, was Antarmukha after doing Maanasa puja  
(Tamil):**   
Worship done without fixing the mind on God, however long it may be, brings no  
benefit ? अन्तर्मुखसमाराध्या बहिर्मुखसुदुर्लभा ? The Goddess is described as  
being inaccessible to one who is a Bahir-mukha ? one whose mind is turned  
towards the world, its objects, and the activities in it. Such a man?s worship  
is merely mechanical. However, when a man is Antarmukha ? one whose mind is  
turned inward and directed towards Her, the Goddess is easily pleased and  
comes within one?s reach.   
The Jagadguru then recounted an incident from the past when His Guru, Himself  
and the Mathadhipati of Tarakeshwar Math in West Bengal had proceeded to offer  
Puja to Sri Tarakeshwara, and how His Guru ? Jagadguru Sri Sri Abhinava  
Vidyatirtha Mahaswamiji was deeply engrossed in the performance of Maanasa  
Puja to Sri Tarakeshwar. While Sri Sannidhanam and the Tarakeshwar  
Mathadhipati used the materials to offer worship, the Mahaswamiji had remained  
motionless and after an hour exclaimed with great satisfaction that He had  
worshipped the Lord by keeping Him in Ratna Simhasanam and offering various  
stotras and puja materials. The Jagadguru described that He had seen His Guru

it is essential to engage in worship of God without allowing the mind to

தமிழையும், தமிழறிஞர்களையும்

பெரிதும் போற்றினார். பெற்றதாய்தனை மகமறந்தாலும்   
பிள்ளையைப் பெற்றதாய் மறந்தாலும்;   
உற்ற தேகத்தை உயிர் மறந்தாலும்   
உயிரைமேவிய உடல் மறந்தாலும்;

\- ராமலிங்க அடிகளாரின் திருவருட்பாவின் திருமுறையில் உள்ள பாட்டை மகள்  
நீலாம்பிகை படிக்க, தந்தை வேதாசலம் கேட்டுக்கொண்டு இருந்தார்.   
சுவாமி வேதாசலத்துக்கு அந்தப் பாடலில் ஒரு நெருடல் இருந்தது. மகளிடமே கேட்டார்.  
??நீலா! இனிமையான இந்தத் தமிழ்ப் பாட்டில் ஒரே ஒரு சமஸ்கிருதச் சொல் இருக்கிறது.  
?உற்ற தேகத்தை உயிர் மறந்தாலும்? என்ற இடத்தில் ?தேகம்? என்பதை நீக்கிவிட்டு  
உடம்பாகிய யாக்கை என்று போட்டால் ஓசை இன்பம் அழகாக இருக்கும். பிறமொழிச் சொற்கள்  
கலப்பதால் தமிழின் இனிமை குன்றுகிறது?? என்றார் வேதாசலம்.   
??அப்படியானால் நாம் அயல்மொழிச் சொற்களை நீக்கித் தனித்தமிழிலேயே பேசுதல்  
வேண்டும்?? என்று 13 வயதே ஆன மகள் நீலாம்பிகை எடுத்துத் தந்தார். அன்றுதான்  
தனித்தமிழ் இயக்கம் தோன்றியது. எதையும் தன்னில் இருந்து தொடங்க வேண்டும் என்ற  
எண்ணம் உடைய சுவாமி வேதாசலம், தனது பெயரை ?மறைமலை அடிகள்? என்று மாற்றிக்  
கொண்டார். தனித்து நிற்கும் தகுதியை உடையது தமிழ் என்று மறைமலை அடிகளால் உலகுக்கு  
உணர்த்தப்பட்டது.

மறைமலை அடிகள். காளிதாசனின் சாகுந்தலத்தை, சமஸ்கிருதத்தில் இருந்து தமிழில்  
மொழிபெயர்க்கும் அளவுக்கு வடமொழி ஆளுமை படைத்தவர். இந்த மொழிபெயர்ப்பைப் படித்த  
காஞ்சி மடாதிபதி சந்திரசேகர ஸ்வாமிகள், ?இதுபற்றி சிறந்த கட்டுரை எழுதும்  
மாணவர்களுக்கு ரூ.100 பரிசு தரப்படும்? என்று 1957-ல் அறிவித்தார். மகா  
பெரியவரையே மயக்கிய மொழிபெயர்ப்பு அது.

Dear Sri Atmavichar,   
Again one beautiful post,and so very true! I am sure many experienced how  
sincere and focused prayer brings results in no time. It can be felt how it  
touches our hearts.   
I have noticed how important is to be focused. And sometimes,when i am absent-  
minded,and do not wish to force myself too much,because my attention goes from  
time to time,i prefer to bring some visual or sound stimuli,to be able to  
focus on the prayer. That usually happens with stotras or mantras. Indeed,much  
better is that prayer is short and full with devotion.   
One funny thing-many times i remember Sri Ramakrishna,and how He slapped one  
woman while giving offerings to Divine Mother in the temple, for she was  
thinking about some worldly matters. When that kind of thing happens, i always  
remember Him.   
Thank You for sharing these beautiful thoughts from Swami!   
With love,

**Experiences with Maha Periyava: Guru Charitra Parayana**   
Sri Maha Periyava veiled His divine powers from us. Many did not understand  
the significance of His divine incarnation. All the same, some have known Sri  
Periyava?s divine powers.   
Chidambara Kulkarni of Hire Bagevadi near Belgaum was deeply devoted to  
Periyava. It was his practice to visit Kanchipuram once, or even twice in a  
year, stay on and read the Guru Charitram (Dattatreya Charitram) in seven days  
as a Sapataha Parayana as a traditional act of adoration. He once visited  
Kanchi with his family for this purpose. Another devotee also came there then.  
He said to Periyava, ?The Guru Charitra Parayana is going on.?   
?How many times has the parayana taken place so far??   
?So far, seventy-two times. The seventy-third Parayana is going on now.?   
Sri Periyava asked an attendant, ?Do you know which Guru Charitram he is  
reading??   
?No? said the attendant in reply.   
?He is reading Periyava?s Charitram (Sri Maha Swamigal Charitram) written by  
Sambhamurthi Sastri every day. He has completed the parayana seventy-two times  
and is now doing it for the seventy-third time. On all days such as Pillayar  
Chathurthi, Krishna Janmashtami, Saraswati Puja and Rama Navami, he worships  
my picture. Other than me, he knows no God.?   
I wanted to know who that devotee was. Periyava indulged in a bit of divine  
play and sent me away from there on an errand, not allowing me to know his  
name or the place he came from. I learnt then that there were many deeply  
devoted to Sri Maha Periyava like Pradosham Venkatarama Iyer Mama.

**Short Messages from Sringeri Jagadgurus:**   
 **Sringeri Jagadguru on What can we Offer God (Telugu):**   
To understand Dharma, Vedanta and other such noble subjects, it is essential  
that we read Sri Adi Shankaracharya?s works. He has written to bestow  
knowledge on a variety of audiences, including the layman.   
TEACHING ONE. OFFER YOUR MIND TO GOD   
For instance, we think that to make an offering to God, we need to take  
fruits, flowers, food, etc. However Sri Shankaracharya says, ?This is fine.  
But this alone is insufficient. There is one thing which is of utmost  
importance, which should be offered. What is that? It is but your mind.  
Without first offering your mind, there is no use of offering anything to  
God.? Therefore, Sri Shankaracharya has said: समर्प्यैकं चेतः सरसिजमुमानाथ भवते   
I should offer my mind as a flower to the Lord?s feet.   
In this context, what is meant by offering the mind to the Lord? Is mind a  
tangible object? How then, is it possible to offer the mind? Offering your  
mind means meditating on the Lord always in your mind. You should think only  
of the Lord, not of other unnecessary things. Why? Because there is simply no  
purpose. There are so many things happening in the world. But do we stand to  
gain anything by thinking about them? No. But if we use the same time to  
meditate upon the Lord, it will give us great benefit. In our life, time is  
invaluable. Wasting it is a big mistake. The only way to not waste it, is to  
think of God always. If even a small bit of time is spent without thinking  
about the Lord, we should be as pained as we would feel if there was a theft  
in our house.   
मुहूर्तमात्रेऽतिक्रान्ते भगवच्चिन्तनं विना ।   
दस्युभिर्मुषितेनेव युक्तमाक्रन्दितुं ध्रुवम् ॥   
If even a moment is wasted without thinking of the Lord, we should feel guilty  
about it. We think of many unnecessary matters. Is it of any use? Certain  
people come to attend a Puja, but start discussing about irrelevant matters,  
when seated in front of the deity. Is that the time to talk such matters?  
Where have you come and what are you discussing? Your duty then is to keep  
thinking of the Lord and watch the Puja. You have to chant the Lord?s name and  
meditate upon Him. Instead, if you let your mind dwell on impertinent matters,  
there is no bigger mistake than this. Therefore, Sri Shankaracharya has asked  
us to offer our mind as a flower to God. In essence, it means: Focus on the  
Lord, without letting your mind wander.
