A Chinese Zen Master used to work hard with his students in the   
gardens. Even when he was eighty, he would trim the trees,   
water the plants and clean the grounds. The students felt bad.   
But they knew that he would never listen to them if they requested   
him to stop working like this. One of them had a brainwave. "Let   
us hide the Master's gardening tools. Then he won't be able to work."   
The others liked the idea and they hid away the master's tools.   
The Master stopped eating from that day. The students thought   
he was angry. So they put the tools back. The Master started   
working and eating as before.   
He called his students before him and said: "No work, no food."

Someone asked the great Zen Master, Bankei, about 'sitting Zen'.   
He repied: "Harmonization with the ineffable wisdom inherent in everyone   
before getting involved in thinking and conceptualization is called   
'meditation.' Detachment from all external objects is called 'sitting'.   
Just closing your eyes and sitting there is not what I call 'sitting   
meditation.' Only sitting meditation attuned to subtle knowledge   
is to be considered of value.   
" All confusion is a matter of revolving in vicious circles of delusion   
because of using thoughts. When angry, thoughts come out,   
you become a titan. Craving makes you an animal. Clinging to   
things makes you a hungry ghost. If you die without giving these   
up, your revolve in a routines forever, taking on all sorts of forms,   
whirling in the flow of birth and death.   
"If you detach from thoughts, there is no confusion, so there is no   
cause or effect. There being no cause or effect, there is no revolving   
in routines. As long as you entertain thoughts, when you cultivate   
good thoughts there are good causes and effects. And when you do   
wrong, there are bad causes and effects. When you have detached   
from thought and tuned to the subtle knowledge, there are no causes   
or effects of birth and death.   
" When I speak this way, it seems like a vision of Nothingness.   
But it is not so. The reason I say that this it is not Nothingness is   
that when I say so, each of you hears it. Even though you do not   
think of hearing, because the original knowlege innate in everyone   
is effectively aware, you can hear it distinctly. When you touch fire   
or water, you know it is hot or cold, yet no one 'learns' to feel heat   
or cold.   
"This is working beyond thought, so even if there is no thought,   
it cannot be called Nothingness. This inherent subtle knowlege   
comprehends everything without involvement in the dualistic   
ideas of Being and Nothingness, just as a clear mirror refelcts   
the images of things distinctly. So what discursive thought is   
necessary for this?   
"Discursive thought is there because there is confusion. When you   
arrive at nondiscursive knowledge, you perceive and distinguish   
things before discursive thought, so in the end there is no confusion.   
That is why non discursive knowledge is valued.   
"For this reason, sitting meditation with unfabricated subtle knowledge is the  
highest practice."   
To be without needs, (and therefore without desires and thoughts)   
is Self actualization. To sleep without dreams is self actualization.

Ryokan (1758-1838), the saintly Japanese poet studied Zen all his life.   
One day, some relatives told him that his nephew, now the manager   
of the family estate, was spending all his money on a geisha. "You   
must do something about it," they implored him.   
The nephew lived far away from where Ryokan lived. The   
poet had not seen him for years. Still, he went to his place.   
The nephew was glad to see him and Ryokan stayed the night there.   
All night Ryokan sat in meditation. In the early morning, when he   
was leaving, he said to his nephew: "Please help me tie the string   
of straw sandal. I am getting old and my hand shakes." The   
nephew readily helped him tie the string. The poet thanked him   
and said: "People get older and weaker day by day. Do take good   
care of yourself." He never said a word about the geisha or the   
nephew's lifestyle. But from that day on, the nephew's dissipations   
stopped altogether!

Yamaoka Tesshu was a tutor of the emperor. He was a Zen Master,   
with great knowledge of fencing.   
His home was the abode of vagabonds. He had but one suit of clothes,   
for they kept him always poor.   
The emperor, observing how worn his garments were, gave Yamaoka   
some money for buying new ones. The next time, he saw Yamaoka,   
he was appearing in the same old worn out clothes.   
"What became of the new clothes, Yamaoka?" asked the emperor.   
"I provided clothes for the children of Your Majesty," explained   
Yamaoka.

The pupils of the Tendai school used to study meditation even before   
Zen entered Japan. Four of them who were intimate friends promised   
one another to observe seven days of silence.   
On the first day all were silent. Their meditation had begun auspiciously.   
But when night came, and the oil lamps were growing dim, one of the   
pupils could not help exclaiming to a servant: "Fix those lamps!"   
The second pupil was surprised to hear the first one talk. He remarked: " We are not supposed to say a word."   
The third then asked: " You two are stupid. Why are you talking?"   
The fourth one then said with a beaming smile: " I am the only one   
who has not talked!"   
Bhagavan Ramana has said that True Silence is the silence of the mind!

After Kakua visited the emperor, he disappeared and no one   
knew what became of him. He was the first Japanese to study   
Zen in China, but since he showed nothing of it, save one note,   
he is not remembered for having brought Zen into his country.   
Kakua visited China and accepted the true teaching. He did not   
travel while he was there. Meditating constantly, he lived on a   
remote part of a mountain. Whenever people found him and asked   
him to preach he would say a few words and then move to another   
part of the mountain where he could be found less easily.   
The emperor heard about Kakua when he returned to Japan and   
asked him to preach Zen for his edification and that of his subjects.   
Kakua stood before the emperor in silence. He then produced a flute   
from the folds of his robe, and blew one short note. Bowing politely,   
he disappeared.

Dear Graham,   
I had two days' powercut and low voltage problems in the city   
and I opened the Forum only today after 17th instant.   
Your message. I do not know whether Sri Ramanasramam's   
publications in Tamil and English are under copy rights. I request   
a reply from you so that I can proceed, if permitted, the Guru   
Ramana Vachana Mala. Till your reply, I am not writing anything   
from that book or any other Ramansramam book.   
Thanking you,   
Yours truly,   
Subramanian. R
