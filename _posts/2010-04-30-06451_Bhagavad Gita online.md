## Hastamalaka Stotra  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: April 30, 2010, 01:04:43 PM

Introduction by Sri Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi   
Wh _en Shankara, the Guru of the world, was travelling in the western parts of  
India and overcoming in debate the expounders of the various schools of  
thought, he once came to a village known as Srivali. When a brahmin inhabitant  
of the village named Prabhakara heard about his arrival he went to him with  
his thirteen year old son. He prostrated before Sankara and made his son also  
prostrate. He then explained that the boy had been dumb from his childhood,  
that he had no likes and dislikes, nor a sense of honour and dishonour, and  
that he was completely inactive. The Guru then raised the boy up and asked him  
as follows in a cheerful tone:_   
 **Text**   
1\. `Who are you? Whose child are you? Whither are you bound? What is your  
name? Whence have you come? Oh Child! I should like to hear your reply to  
these questions.' Thus spoke Sri Shankaracharya to the boy, and Hastamalaka  
replied as follows.   
2\. I am neither man, God, yaksha, brahmin, kshatriya,vaisya, sudra,  
brahmachari, householder, forest-dweller, nor sannyasi; but I am pure  
awareness alone.   
3\. Just as the sun causes all worldly movements, so do I -- the ever-present,  
conscious Self -- cause the mind to be active and the senses to function.  
Again, just as the ether is all-pervading, yet devoid of any specific  
qualities, so am I free from all qualities.   
4\. I am the conscious Self, ever-present and associated with everything in  
the same manner as heat is always associated with fire. I am that eternal,  
undifferentiated, unshaken Consciousness, on account of which the insentient  
mind and senses function, each in its own manner.   
 **5\. I am that conscious Self of whom the ego is not independent as the  
image in a mirror is not independent of the object reflected.**   
6\. I am the unqualified, conscious Self, existing even after the extinction  
of buddhi, just as the object remains ever the same even after the removal of  
the reflecting mirror.   
7\. I am eternal Consciousness, dissociated from the mind and senses. I am the  
mind of the mind, the eye of the eye, ear of the ear and so on. I am not  
cognizable by the mind and senses.   
 **8\. I am the eternal, single, conscious Self, reflected in various  
intellects, just as the sun is reflected on the surface of various sheets of  
water.**   
9\. I am the single, conscious Self, illumining all intellects, just as the  
sun simultaneously illumines all eyes so that they perceive objects.   
10\. Only those eyes that are helped by the sun are capable of seeing objects,  
not others. The source from which the sun derives its power is myself.   
 **11\. Just as the reflection of the sun on agitated waters seems to break  
up, but remains perfect on a calm surface, so also am I, the conscious Self,  
unrecognizable in agitated intellects though I clearly shine in those which  
are calm.**   
12\. Just as a fool thinks that the sun is entirely lost when it is hidden by  
dense clouds, so do people think that the ever-free Self is bound.   
13\. Just as the ether is all-pervading and unaffected by contact, so also  
does the ever-conscious Self pervade everything without being affected in  
anyway. I am that Self.   
14\. Just as a transparent crystal takes on the lines of its background, but  
is in no way changed thereby, and just as the unchanging moon on being  
reflected on undulating surfaces appears agitated, so is it with you, the all-  
pervading God.   
15\. As this stotra reveals the Self as clearly as the amalaka fruit placed on  
the palm of the hand (hasta), it received the name Hastamalaka Strotra.  
Moreover, the boy, eminent in jnana, came to be praised by all people of this  
world as Hastamalaka.   
The father of the boy was speechless with wonder at those words. But the  
Acharya said to him: `He has become your son because of his incomplete  
austerities. This is your good fortune. He will not be of any use to you in  
this world. Let him stay with me.' He bade him go back and, taking the boy  
with him, proceeded on his way. The disciples then asked him: `How did this  
boy attain the state of Brahman without hearing, etc.?' The Guru replied: `His  
mother left her two year old child in the care of a great and highly  
accomplished yogi who was practising austerities on the bank of the Yamuna  
while she went to bathe in the river with some women. The child toddled  
towards the water and was drowned. Out of his compassion for the disconsolate  
mother the sadhu forsook his body and entered that of the child. That is why  
this boy has attained this high state.'

Dear prasanth,   
Sri Bhagavan's famous question Who am I? was asked by Sri   
Sankara to Hastamalaka as Who are you? The boy answered,   
what Sri Sankara himself answered to Govinda Bhagavadpada on   
the Narmada valley cave, when the latter asked him, Who are you?   
This is Sri Sankara's famous Nirvana Shatkam.   
The Hastamalaka Stotram, Tamizh versification of Sri Bhagavan,   
is chanted in weekly parayana on Friday evernings.   
Arunachala Siva.

Missed commenting on this one.To think of knowing more than Sri  
Ramanujacharya!I do not consider that anyone else knows more than that-be it  
be Sri Sankara or Sri Ramakrishna or Sri Bhagavan or Sri Aurobindo.We only  
need to bear in my mind that these are not 'individual' achievements.All  
Love,Knowledge are in God alone.

The spirit was surely not like "trying to know more than Sri Ramanujacharya"  
or just any body else... I was trying to observe that we are getting lost in  
"Tatvas" unconsciously, we somehow refuse to move on, and stay put with  
tatvas. We all would have experienced it, most times, after some heavy  
discussions on Tatvas, no matter how great it may be, when we becomre fatigued  
out, even sleeping for some time, would bestow such peace, just shutting down  
the computer and being, would give such immense peace. truth itself was  
spoiling Truth. Knwoledge is bigger ignorance than ignorance itself.   
It is not even about achievements, that i was observing about. It is the real  
paradox that i have observed, that has landed in a state of complete "not  
knowing"   
Like what Socratus has said "All that i know is the fact of my not knowing"   
How insignificant we are, in the scheme of things, how insignificant we are  
before the "tatvas"   
Ultimatley, i truly believe it is peace alone that matters, even more than any  
scriptures, terms of truth, we have to be at peace with what ever is. What  
ever is, is, as it is. We have nothing to do with it.   
_The awful daring of a moment 's surrender   
Which an age of prudence can never retract   
By this, and this only, we have existed.   
(T S Eliiot)

Shanti Shanti Shanti

At some point, i see, perhaps discern, we have to even give up Our Guru with  
his teachings, and, just accept Him, without any baggage, plain, simple, as a  
perfect layman. He is our Guru, who takes away everything, even all  
knowledge...   
I have observed, even seeing our Gurus as somebody of great knowledge, all  
knowing, great Brahma Jnani, Brahma Nishta etc... is in some ways problematic.   
After knowing our Gurus, i guess, at some point when we are really, at peace,  
we should give away all our books and remain. Noo Tatvas, No Siddhantas, no  
nothing, No this, No that, just   
Knowledge is great bondage...   
theLivu guruvin thirumEni kANDal   
theLivu guruvin thirunAmam ceppal   
theLivu guruvin thiruvArththai kETTal   
theLivu guruvuru cinthiththal thAnE.   
Clarity is seeing the holy Body of guru;   
Clarity is saying the holy Name of guru;   
Clarity is listening to the holy Words of guru;   
Clarity is contemplating on the holy Form of guru.   
Do we need anything more? really? But this makes so much sense only after  
realising the futility of all knowledge.   
Like Chinmayananda says somewhere, one can only renounce only after one has  
earned millions... (not exact phrase) Before that what one has to renounce...   
Knowledge is worst than even ignorance... ignorance reveals itself instantly,  
but this knowledge-ignorance, hides iself as perfect knowledge...dangerous  
fellow is this knowledge-ignorance

Sri Ravi,   
Are we ready yet, to accept that there is really nothing to do? the truth is  
so ordinary, that we are unable to accept the ordinary-ness of what is.   
We want something more... we just are not content, "is that all, there should  
be something more to this" goes unconsciously...   
_" One goes through all sorts of austerities to become what one already  
is." _** \- Bhagavan   
Funny, as we don't want to accept this, until we travel, we do all those  
austerities, all those struggles, all those mental masturbation, all those  
games of knowledge and ignorance, etc...

I do not subscribe to this view,because these are thoughts!We only need to  
reckon the immensity of this 'Ordinariness' which made the Upanishadic seer  
exclaim-'Vedahamehtam purusham mahantam,Aditya varnam Tamasah parastat'.Simply  
speaking,The Infinte is beyond the realms of 'Ordinary' and 'Extraordinary'.   
Quote  
> Quote  
>  
>> **" One goes through all sorts of austerities to become what one already

This has to be understood,not as a thought but experientially.It is not as if  
one came Back to where he started from.   
Quote  
> Clarity is seeing the holy Body of guru;

Precisely.Here Tirumular is trying to point to what Clarity is.It is not  
clarity as we imagine clarity to be- _' that the truth is so ordinary, that we  
are unable to accept the ordinary-ness of what is'_!'   
Quote

> knowledge...dangerous fellow is this knowledge-ignorance**  
I have also been emphasizing the same.We may have seen the crow fluttering its  
wings rapidly to gain height and then perform a Glide(with its wings  
spread).It lands on a tree top in the smug belief that it has done a sortie of  
an Eagle.Little does it know that that the Eagle is gliding at will at a great  
Height **,borne upward by buoyancy of the wind on its wings**.Most aspirants  
imagine that they are in the 'Just be' state or 'There is nothing to be  
done',etc.I have seen learned Swamijis caught in this belief.This belief is  
propagated as 'Yajnya'.   
I agree with you that Guru is a Tatva and personality cults are dangerous and  
detrimental.Devotion to the Guru is onething and admiration and attachment to  
the Guru is another.   
Namaskar.

Dear Sri Ravi,   
Do we realise, that the problem begins, this: Quote  
> Simply speaking,The Infinte is beyond the realms of 'Ordinary' and  
> 'Extraordinary'.   
>  
at putting the truth elsewhere, terming it as something, beyond ordinary and  
extra ordinary? We are in timeless search of this infinite.   
This "beyond" thing is only the true real Maya. There is no beyond, nothing  
beyond, than what is now, here. This only is **" Vasthvam"**   
Truth, happiness, everything is here, is its pristinity, only the demand for  
want of a higher better truth is the real problem.   
I do not intend to term it as 'ordinary' but it is just done so to lay stress  
on the fact of the truth, not being something more than what is, here, as it  
is, and not something better than what currently is.   
It discerns that the demand to search supercedes than the truth itself.

All these talks are only because non of us want to surrender and inquire to  
one's Being. To some of you this may sound funny but it is true. I really hope  
all of you to understand me right. I don't judge or anything. I am just trying  
to help you sharing my thoughts (which of course may be wrong).   
What I have in mind is that no matter what words or theories we share we are  
ignorant. The Knowledge all Saints are talking about, the so called jnana  
(Hindu), gnosis (Christians) or daat (Kabbalists) is to know our Self. If you  
do it no more questions will arise. All is the Self, all is God. There is no  
duality. In Guru Vachaka Kovai is stated: Quote  
> 47\. This world which appears, concealing Self, is a mere dream, but when  
> âconcealedâ by Self, it remains as none other than Self.   
>   
> 48\. This whole world of triads which deludes us, seeming to be an  
> undisputable reality, is only the form of the Supreme Power [Chit-Shakti],  
> which abides eternally as none other than the Supreme Self.   
>   
> 50\. For those who never lose the True Knowledge of Self, which is the base  
> of all sense-knowledge, the world also is nothing other than Self-Knowledge.  
> But, how can an ordinary man, who has not gained Self-knowledge, understand  
> the statement of Sages who, seeing through Jnana, say that the world is  
> real?   
>   
> 51\. Those who have given up worldly [i.e. sense-] knowledge and attachment  
> to it, and who have destroyed the evil force of mind [i.e. Maya], thus  
> gaining Supreme Self-Consciousness, alone can know the correct meaning of  
> the statement, âThe world is Realâ.  
The experience of the bhakta is the same as the experience of the jnani but  
they call it sometime in different way. Those who say that all is God do not  
contradict with jnanis who say that there is only the Self. Can you see? All  
our discussion is based on whether the world is real and according to the  
answer of this question - how to behave. None of us can understand the real  
jnani and the real bhakta. The Supreme Lord in the Form of Lord Krishna says  
in Bhagavad Gita that Jnana yoga and Bhakti yoga lead to the same. If you  
don't believe in the Saints' words, believe in the Lord's.   
The knowledge mentioned here is not intellectual but experiential. Non of us  
would have this knowledge if we are looking for it by the intellect.   
As I said in the beginning the cause for all these conversations is our  
reslessness, of our mind bouncing here and there and not wanting to be drawn  
to the Source. It is like a man who have a toothache and fear of dentists and  
every day he says "I will go to the dentists later or tomorrow".   
One of the cause for the lack of surrender is too little faith. Not to mention  
that many following jnana say that God or Guru is unreal. How one to surrender  
to a Person who he/she subconsciously consider unreal. In my opinion many  
choose jnana marga because of their fat ego because jnana teach "You are the  
Supreme" and ego only waits to hear that but not realizing that jnanis don't  
talk about it (the ego) but about the Atman.   
Most of us more talk about Self-inqiury than practice it (I don't talk about  
you but generally). That again is because of the ego. It gets fatter because  
it considers itself that it knows the supreme path (jnana yoga) and the  
supreme method (Self-inquiry) by the Supreme Guru (Guru Ramana). It's getting  
fatter and fatter and fatter. But in reality we are falling down. We are just  
talking and do nothing. Even some "jnanis" justify their inactivity by saying  
"there is nothing to be done". This is wrong.   
Analyze yourself, analyze where are you now. Stop saying "I am the Self. I am  
always realized". No, you are not.   
Best wishes, ramana1359

Yes,friend.This is a sign that the mind free from distractions is _loving what  
it is doing_.   
Here are a few excerpts from the Gospel of sri Ramakrishna that shows what it  
means to 'Just be',to be in the state of jnana: Quote  
> "To follow jnanayoga in this age is also very difficult. First, a man's life

The test of jnana is not whether 'I' is there or not.It is the absence of  
identification with the body.This is what Sri Bhagavan went through when he  
was in the patala linga when his body was eaten by insects and worms.It is  
what happened to sri Ramakrishna when he spent 6 months in the Nirvikalpa  
Samadhi, totally unaware of his body.How Sri Bhagavan underwent surgery  
without any anaesthesia! How Sri Ramakrishna when down with Throat  
cancer,unable to even swallow Liquids could not bring himself to wish that the  
body should recover-How the Divine Mother(Sri Ramakrishna!)told him-'Is it not  
enough that you are eating through other mouths'!   
I am not saying that all need to be like this-at the same time,it does give an  
idea of what Jnana or the state of 'summa Iru' is.This is the order of  
immensity.   
There are many seekers who get caught on the way with a little peace, a little  
vastness, a little quietude-and they think that they have arrived.One only  
needs to consolidate this quietude and this is jnana for them.   
This is why sri Bhagavan never taught the 'Just Be' teaching.He only stressed  
'self-enquiry' and to trace the source of the Mind.   
Similiarly Sri Ramakrishna narrated this parable: Quote  
> **The story of the wood-cutter**   
> "Once upon a time a wood-cutter went into a forest to chop wood. There  
> suddenly he met a   
> brahmachari. The holy man said to him, 'My good man, go forward.' On

If we get stuck somewhere,we cannot throw the towel and call all this as  
unnecessary.It just means that we are striving in an egoistic way-we are still  
not recognizing the role of Grace.We are stuck on account of this.It is the  
wind of Grace that can carry us home.   
Wishing you the very Best.   
Namaskar.

Ramana,   
Quote  
> " **It is like a man who have a toothache and fear of dentists and every day

 Looks like Toothache is linked with jnana!   
There is a humorous anecdote that Sri Nochur Venkatraman narrated.It seems  
that one person came to him and enquired about the efficacy of Transcen  
**dental Meditation**.Nochur told him that he only knew 'Dental Meditation'  
and this is truly effective.   
'What is Dental Meditation?' asked the other person.   
'It is what Sri Ramakrishna taught ' said Nochur and told him this saying of  
Sri Ramakrishna: Quote  
> MASTER:" **One can meditate even with eyes open. One can meditate even while  
> talking. Take the   
> case of a man with toothache**.   
> TUTOR OF THE TAGORES: "Yes, sir. I know that very well." (All laugh.)   
> MASTER (smiling): **" Yes, even when his teeth ache he does all his  
> duties,but his mind is   
> on the pain. Likewise one can meditate with eyes open and while talking to  
> others as well."**  
Namaskar.

Yes, in the way that lack of jnana leads to samsara (toothache). We prefer to  
be in pain rather than follow Guru and His teachings (the dentist) and be  
free. We always excuse saying "Later or tomorrow". Most people pospone their  
sadhana all their life, others even forget about what they have promised to  
themselves to do. Others do it occasionally only when they feel sad, depressed  
or some dramatic event reminds them about cruelty of the world

Really true.

dear Ravi, Ramana,   
Not a directly related story, but somewhat the same. Once a devotee asked Sri  
Bhagavan: Bhagavan! Can I swat the mosquito   
that stings me during meditation? Or should I leave it as it is?   
Sri Bhagavan smilingly replied: You can swat the mosquito. For that act, mukti  
will not be denied to you. You can also leave   
it as it is. For that act, mukti will not be given to you. In true  
meditation, one will not even experience whether a mosquito   
is sitting on your body and it is stinging you!   
Arunachala Siva.
