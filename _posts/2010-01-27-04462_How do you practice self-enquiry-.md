## How do you practice self-enquiry?

I've noticed that people give different instructions how to do this practice.  
Subramanian.R said: "Who am I? is the greatest devotion. Hence this thought should   
be retained till it matures into surrender."   
But others say that it is only important to give attention to this sense I am.  
So how do you do it? Do you mentally (verbally) say these enquiries "Who am  
I", "Whence am I" or do you just come back to the sense of being if you get  
lost in thought?

Dear snow,   
Both are correct. The first one results in the realization that   
I and You are one and the same. There is no 'i' but only you.   
This is total surrender.   
When one asks Who am I?, if there is no further answer, you   
realize that I am Atma. This is Self enquiry.   
Surrender and self enquiry are the two sides of the same coin.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Snow,   
There was a person who looked into the well, and thought his head fell into  
the well.   
what should he do to get out of the fear?   
So someone said "Find out who you are"   
Someone else said, be with the sense of "I". .. where is it? Is it in the well  
or here outside ?   
Essentially, to understand clearly that one has not fallen into the well. ..  
and motion in well is not affecting us. .. this is liberation... coz one has  
never fallen. ..   
The head is always here and now there in the well. ..   
"I" am Consciousness. .. i never can "Fall" into the "mind"   
Love!   
Silence

Sorry for not responding for a while, I've been busy with school work. But I'd  
like to get a little bit more feedback from you guys. I know that these are  
essentialy the same practice, but until now I've only practiced being still   
with the remembrance of the feeling I, like sri Sadhu Om thauht. But I've  
noticed that my mind wonders quite a lot when I'm not sitting on cushion and  
purposfully meditating.   
So do you repeat this question "Who am I" to make the mind quiet or do you  
just try to pay attention to this feeling of being all the time?   
thanks

The silent core of our being is covered by the tendencies of the mind which  
always clamour for attention, so we often live a "surface-mind" existence.  
Self-enquiry is to keep the attention to the core of our being (whatever one  
feels as the innermost core of the being). With practice our deeper self is  
felt more and more as the substratum and the mind stops seeking external joys  
leaving the silence, peace and bliss of the inner core. The mind will continue  
to do the daily chores, but now in the "meadow" of the silence and bliss of  
the deeper self.   
Along with self-enquiry, one should try to reduce all causes of disturbances  
of the mind as far as possible and infuse conditions of peace. For example, if  
watching TV introduces an undercurrent of disturbance, stop watching TV. If  
listening to mantras infuses peaceful vibrations within, listen to mantras.  
People often take to spiritual path without stopping negative habits which is  
like trying to row a leaking boat. Spirituality is of the nature of full  
dedication of our heart to our inner being (or to God) and any tendencies  
which tries to prevent this is an obstacle.   
Finally all depends on God. When He wills, He will reveal His glory, may be  
little by little.

Dear snow,   
That there are thoughts is never a problem. .. "I" have thoughts is the  
problem.   
That there is a wound on body is not a problem. .. but when I have it, its a  
problem.   
So. .. its not the thoughts, but the "I" who is getting affected by thoughts  
that is the problem.   
to go back to my example. .. when i see in the well, i see my head there. ..  
that the head is reflected in the water is never a problem.... the problem is  
... if i think my head fell into the well!   
Please see the subtle difference !   
Love!

Dear snow,   
Thoughts will come and go. Try to retain the essential thoughts   
first and then throw the remaining. Then bring in the noble thought   
of I am Sivam or I am God's slave or a mantra, Amitabo Buddho as   
Buddhists do. This thought will drive away other thoughts slowly   
through continuous practice. Finally you will be thoughtless.   
Thereafter, the essential thoughts like I should go for a bath or I should eat  
now, will remain as the vehicle of the Self within you and not that of the  
mind.   
Arunachala Siva.

You say Who am I? becomes a japa.   
It is not meant that you should go on asking Who am I?   
In that case, thought will not so easily die.   
(Day by Day with Bhagavan, 8-10-46)   
Sadhu: Am I to keep on repeating Who am I? so as to make a mantra of it?   
Bhagavan: No. Who am I? is not a mantra.   
It means that you must find out where in you arises the I-thought which is the  
source of all other thoughts.   
But if you find this vichara marga too hard for you, you can go on repeating  
I, I and that will lead you to the same goal.   
There is no harm in using I as a mantra. It is the first name of God.   
(ibid., 8-5-46)

Dear friend,   
Who am I? is not a mantra. This is a question which should result in no   
answer sooner or later. Whereas I am Siva, Sivoham, or Siva kevalam,   
is a mantra. This results in surrender that I am really, Siva the One without   
a second. Bhagavan Himself has said that Who am I is not a mantra. But   
Siva, Siva or simply even I, I, I is a mantra.   
Arunachala Siva.

I believe this could be good practice for me since I don't have a lot  
meditation experience and in worldy life I find it difficult to keep still.  
But since I don't have experience of mantras I wonder how often is "I"  
supposed to be repeated. (with every in and out breath? Once in breath cycle  
or infrequently?)

Dear Japo, I find this method of Self-enquiry helpful. Bhagavan has said  
repeat I, I, I,..... in your mind. My view is nothing else matters, so  
thinking about in- breath or out-breath does not come into it. For how long is  
important. It is easy to try for too long and become despondent because it is  
very easy to get distracted. One of the posts by Amiatall was helpful in this  
respect. The advice was to practise for short periods. For me it was the  
distance between 2 lampposts or trees etc (~50 metres or less), really a  
matter of not many seconds. Even then there are distractions. After those  
seconds of practise I let the mind do what it wants for a short period and  
then begin the practise again and then carry on with this cycle. For me it is  
the duration Im out walking with our dog. This has worked for me. There are  
days when the mind will go nowhere near I and thats when I take advice from  
one of Grahams posts and ask God to help me surrender. What is difficult is  
bringing it into the rest of the day though, this for me is not very  
successful though.   
paul.

Whether it is I,I,I or Siva, Siva or Arunachala Siva... is effective.  
Naturally   
one cannot practice it, throughout the day, and it is not necessary too.   
But you can practice, when you find that you are not using some time   
intervals properly. e.g. When you wait for a tramcar or a metro train   
or when you go to bed and it make take sometime for you to actually   
sleep deep. For me it has worked well in such periods of time.   
Arunachala Siva.
