Once, Suta had gone to Naimisharanya. All the sages residing there asked him  
about the manifestation of   
Arunachala Shivalinga.Suta recounted a tale when Sage Sanaka had posed the  
same query to Lord Brahma - 'Lord   
Brahma had told Sanaka - Son, once Lord Vishnu and I witnessed an effulgent  
Pillar. It had manifested from   
nowhere and was limitless in size. It's radiance put the whole world ablaze.  
Both of us worshipped that marvelous   
pillar by chanting vedic mantras. 'Actually, that effulgent pillar was a  
Shivalinga. Lord Shiva manifested from it after   
being pleased by our devotion. We requested him to minimize his size and  
establish himself in the form of   
Arunachala Shivalinga.'   
'Lord Shiva agreed to minimize his size as well as his effulgence by  
establishing himself in the form of   
'Arunachaleshwar'.The holy place of Arunachaleshwar remains untouched while  
the whole world gets   
submerged in water at the time of deluge.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Correct. The story has been graphically described in Arunachala   
Mahatmayam and Arunachala Puranam, Tamil. In Arunachala,   
the Hill, the Siva linga and Sri Ramana are the three lingas and all are same.  
The Hill is full of grace. There is a story about Siva's grace.   
He believes that whenever the crow drops its excreta, it is white washing the  
Hill! When ever an animal in the Hill passes urine, Siva believes that he is  
given a bath! Whenever the glowworm passes in the night on the Hill, Siva  
believes that the glow worm is showing arti to Him! How can one describe  
Siva's grace?   
Arunachala Siva.
