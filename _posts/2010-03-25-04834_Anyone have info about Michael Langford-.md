## Regarding permission for translation

Ragarding permission for translation from Bhagavan and Ramanashram   
1\. Is it necessary to get permission from Ramanashram   
to upload your own translation of Ramanashram books,   
\- only books which is free to download \-   
on your own websites or blogs?   
I have been thinking of translating some of them into Japanese and Chinese.   
But I am not familiar with copyright rules.   
2\. One more thing I am concerned is   
Bhagavan sometimes did not allow devotees to publish English translations.   
Is it bad to translate materials without Bhagavan's permission?   
Strictly speaking, I think it is bad. Then what to do?

Dear Akira,   
Yes, there is a copyright rule for all books of Sri Ramanasramam and it  
requires prior   
permission to translate them and publish them in Japanese etc., The works  
cannot   
be given in full form in this Forum too. One can go only for a few excerpts  
here   
and there to make a point.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear rideover,   
The simplest book as far as I know, is Who am I? by Bhagavan   
Ramana. No quotes from outside. All His experience. This was   
WRITTEN and given to Sivaprakasam Pillai and hence no different   
versions, no dilutions due to lapse of time. I read this book   
everyday and it gives me the unadulterated guidance that has   
helped me a lot.   
Arunachala Siva.   
Well, if people are afraid of trying ''the awareness watching awareness''  
method -I don't blame them: the world is full of false masters-, Ramana's  
Self-enquiry method is good enough because it leads to Self-awareness, through  
the agency of Self-attention. Sri Sadhu Om explains excellently Ramana's Self-  
enquiry in his book, ''The Path of Sri Ramana'': http://www.notthisnotthat.com/resources/The_Path_of_Sri_Ramana_Part_One.pdf   
I will give some quotes from his book (pages 137-138): ''Just as the correct meaning of the term meditation upon Brahman  
(brahmadhyanam) used by the sastras up till now is explained by Sri Bhagavan  
in the last two lines of the first benedictory verse of Ulladhu Narpadhu to  
be abiding in the Heart as it is (that is to say, abiding as Self is the  
correct way of meditating upon it), so also, the correct meaning of the term  
Self-enquiry (atma-vichara) is here rightly explained to be turning  
Selfwards (or attending to Self).''   
''In either of these two kinds of enquiry (Who am I? or Whence am I ?),  
since the attention of the aspirant is focused only on himself, nothing other  
than Self (atman), which is the true import of the word I, will be finally  
experienced.''   
''Therefore, whether done in the form Whence am I? or Who am I ?, what is  
absolutely essential is that Self-attention should be pursued till the very  
end.''   
P.S. Sri Sadhu Om Swamigal tirelessly practised Self-Enquiry in a remote house  
'Sri Arunachala Ramana Nilayam' in the interior of Thiruvannamalai for 30-odd  
years, and scrupulously wrote down the difficulties faced by him in Self-  
Enquiry and also the methods by which he overcame them.

A few only [eg. David Godman, Robert Butler, Michael   
James] have understood Bhagavan Ramana correctly   
David Godman, in his blog, says that Michael Lnagford's method is correct.   
(I myself do not think his method is correct.)

I agree with you. Once in a while, I disagree with David also.
