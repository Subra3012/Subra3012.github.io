Whatever work Vidyasagara has done for others has been very good and helpful.  
To be kind and compassionate is also good; but there is a difference between  
compassion and attachment. **Compassion is good, but attachment is not.  
Attachment is love for wife, children, brother, sister, father, mother and  
other relatives, while true compassion is equal love for all living  
creatures.**   
Mahendra: Is compassion also a bondage?   
Ramakrishna: This question is not for ordinary mortals. **Compassion is the  
result of the Sattwa quality. The Sattwa quality is protective, the Rajas  
quality is creative, and Tamas is destructive: but Brahman the Absolute is  
beyond these three qualities, Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas.** It is also beyond  
Prakriti or nature. Where there is absolute Reality, no quality of nature can  
reach. As a thief cannot go to the exact spot where the treasure is, because  
he is afraid of being caught, so Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas, like thieves,  
cannot go to the realm where, is the treasure of the Absolute. [p. 253]

Brahman is Nirguna, where there are no gunas, sattva, rajas,   
and tamas.   
Arunachala Siva.
