H.H. Swami Chinmayananda (8 May 1916 â 3 August 1993), **born Balakrishna  
Menon (Balan) was an Indian spiritual leader, and teacher, who inspired the  
formation of Chinmaya Mission in 1953 to spread the message of Vedanta.**   
 **Chinmaya Mission has over 300 centers in India and the world over.**   
He was a disciple of Swami Sivananda at Rishikesh, who founded the Divine Life  
Society.   
Balakrishna Menon (Balan) was born in Ernakulam, **Kerala** in a devout Hindu  
noble family called "Poothampalli" of Makia Awwa and Kuttan Menon. Upon his  
birth, his father called for an astrologer, who stated that Balan's birth was  
an auspicious one, and that he was destined to be a king. He graduated from  
Madras University in 1939 and went on to do graduate study in English  
literature from Lucknow University.   
Swami Chinmayananda started the tradition of Gyana Yagnas, in an effort to  
spread the message of the Geeta and the Upanishads, thus the first such Geeta  
Gyan Yagna was held in Pune between December 31, 1951 and April 1952   
He founded the Chinmaya Mission in 1953 and later played an important role in  
the formation of Vishva Hindu Parishad in 1964. He became the first president  
of Vishva Hindu Parishad and served VHP in the role of a spiritual advisor  
thereafter. During his forty years of travelling and teaching, Swami  
Chinmayananda opened numerous centres and ashrams worldwide, he also built  
many schools, hospitals, nursing homes and clinics. His interest in helping  
the villagers with basic necessities lead to the eventual creation of a rural  
development project, known as the Chinmaya Organization for Rural Development  
or CORD. Its National Director, Dr. Kshama Metre was recently awarded the  
Padma Shree National award in Social Work.   
Swami Chinmayananda died on 3 August 1993 in San Diego, California, and his  
mortal remains were placed in a Samadhi on 19th August, 1993, at the Sidhbari  
Ashram in the Himalayas.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Nisargadatta Maharaj says Beyond Mind there is no Suffering

Questioner: I see you sitting in your son's house waiting for lunch to be  
served. And I wonder whether the content of your consciousness is similar to  
mine, or partly different, or totally different. Are you hungry and thirsty as  
I am, waiting rather impatiently for the meals to be served, or are you in an  
altogether different state of mind?   
Maharaj: There is not much difference on the surface, but very much of it in  
depth. You know yourself only through the senses and the mind. You take  
yourself to be what they suggest; having no direct knowledge of yourself, you  
have mere ideas; all mediocre, second-hand, by hearsay. Whatever you think you  
are you take it to be true; the habit of imagining yourself perceivable and  
describable is very strong with you.   
I see as you see, hear as you hear, taste as you taste, eat as you eat. I also  
feel thirst and hunger and expect my food to be served on time. When starved  
or sick, my body and mind go weak. All this I perceive quite clearly, but  
somehow I am not in it, I feel myself as if floating over it, aloof and  
detached. Even not aloof and detached. There is aloofness and detachment as  
there is thirst and hunger; there is also the awareness of it all and a sense  
of Immense distance, as if the body and the mind and all that happens to them  
were somewhere far out on the horizon. **I am like a cinema screen -- clear  
and empty -- the pictures pass over it and disappear, leaving it as clear and  
empty as before. In no way is the screen affected by the pictures, nor are the  
pictures affected by the screen. The screen intercepts and reflects the  
pictures, it does not shape them. It has nothing to do with the rolls of  
films. These are as they are, lumps of destiny (prarabdha), but not my  
destiny; the destinies of the people on the screen.**   
Q: Yes, you are right. A life story unrolls itself of which I am one of the  
actors. I have no being outside it, as it has no being without me. I am merely  
a character, not a person.   
M: The character will become a person, when he begins to shape his life  
instead of accepting it as it comes, and identifying himself with it.   
Q: When I ask a question and you answer, what exactly happens?   
M: The question and the answer -- both appear on the screen. The lips move,  
the body speaks -- and again the screen is clear and empty.   
Q: When you say: clear and empty, what do you mean?   
M: I mean free of all contents. To myself I am neither perceivable nor  
conceivable; there is nothing I can point out and say: 'this I am'. You  
identify yourself with everything so easily, I find it impossible. **The  
feeling: 'I am not this or that, nor is anything mine' is so strong in me that  
as soon as a thing or a thought appears, there comes at once the sense 'this I  
am not'.**   
Q: Do you mean to say that you spend your time repeating 'this I am not, that  
I am not'?   
M: Of course not. I am merely verbalizing for your sake. By the grace of my  
Guru I have realised once and for good that I am neither object nor subject  
and I do not need to remind myself all the time.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda says to regain lost faith is to believe "I am the Soul"  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 04, 2010, 10:05:20 AM

**VEDANTA IN ITS APPLICATION TO INDIAN LIFE   
Volume 3, Lectures from Colombo to Almora  
_With the Advaitist the one difference is that he admits evolution in nature  
and not in the soul. Suppose there is a screen, and there is a small hole in  
the screen. I am a man standing behind the screen and looking at this grand  
assembly. I can see only very few faces here. Suppose the hole increases; as  
it increases, more and more of this assembly is revealed to me, and in full  
when the hole has become identified with the screen  there is nothing between  
you and me in this case. Neither you changed nor I changed; all the change was  
in the screen. You were the same from first to last; only the screen changed.  
This is the Advaitist 's position with regard to evolution  evolution of  
nature and manifestation of the Self within. _   
**Not that the Self can by any means be made to contract. It is unchangeable,  
the Infinite One. It was covered, as it were, with a veil, the veil of Maya,  
and as this Maya veil becomes thinner and thinner, the inborn, natural glory  
of the soul comes out and becomes more manifest. This is the one great  
doctrine which the world is waiting to learn from India.   
Our Upanishads say that the cause of all misery is ignorance; and that is  
perfectly true when applied to every state of life, either social or  
spiritual.** It is ignorance that makes us hate each other, it is through  
ignorance that we do not know and do not love each other. As soon as we come  
to know each other, love comes, must come, for are we not ones.   
**What do we want in India?** If foreigners want these things, we want them  
twenty times more. Because, in spite of the greatness of the Upanishads, in  
spite of our boasted ancestry of sages, compared to many other races, I must  
tell you that we are weak, very weak. **First of all is our physical weakness.  
That physical weakness is the cause of at least one-third of our miseries. We  
are lazy, we cannot work; we cannot combine, we do not love each other; we are  
intensely selfish, not three of us can come together without hating each  
other, without being jealous of each other.**   
 **We have lost faith. Would you believe me, we have less faith than the  
Englishman and woman  a thousand times less faith! These are plain words; but  
I say these, I cannot help it. Don 't you see how Englishmen and women, when  
they catch our ideals, become mad as it were; and although they are the ruling  
class, they come to India to preach our own religion notwithstanding the jeers  
and ridicule of their own countrymen? How many of you could do that? And why  
cannot you do that? Do you not know it? You know more than they do; you are  
more wise than is good for you, that is your difficulty! Simply because your  
blood is only like water, your brain is sloughing, your body is weak! You must  
change the body.  
**And the first step in getting strength is to uphold the Upanishads, and  
believe  "I am the Soul", "Me the sword cannot cut; nor weapons pierce; me  
the fire cannot burn; me the air cannot dry; I am the Omnipotent, I am the  
Omniscient."**   
 _If the fisherman thinks that he is the Spirit, he will be a better  
fisherman; if the student thinks he is the Spirit, he will be a better  
student. If the lawyer thinks that he is the Spirit, he will be a better  
lawyer, and so on, and the result will be that the castes will remain for  
ever. It is in the nature of society to form itself into groups; and what will  
go will be these privileges. Caste is a natural order; I can perform one duty  
in social life, and you another; you can govern a country, and I can mend a  
pair of old shoes, but that is no reason why you are greater than I, for can  
you mend my shoes? Can I govern the country? I am clever in mending shoes, you  
are clever in reading Vedas, but that is no reason why you should trample on  
my head._   
 **Who are you to assume that you know everything?** How dare you think, O  
blasphemers, that you have the right over God? For don't you know that every  
soul is the Soul of God? **Mind your own Karma; a load of Karma is there in  
you to work out.** Your nation may put you upon a pedestal, your society may  
cheer you up to the skies, and fools may praise you: but He sleeps not, and  
retribution will be sure to follow, here or hereafter.   
Look upon every man, woman, and every one as God. **You cannot help anyone,  
you can only serve: serve the children of the Lord, serve the Lord Himself, if  
you have the privilege.** If the Lord grants that you can help any one of His  
children, blessed you are; do not think too much of yourselves. Blessed you  
are that that privilege was given to you when others had it not. Do it only as  
a worship. I should see God in the poor, and it is for my salvation that I go  
and worship them.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda says women must grow in the footprints of Sita

**THE SAGES OF INDIA   
Volume 3, Lectures from Colombo to Almora  
This mind is continually changing, always in a state of flux; it is finite, it  
is broken into pieces. How can nature tell of the Infinite, the Unchangeable,  
the Unbroken, the Indivisible, the Eternal? It never can. **Even in our lives,  
in the life of every one of us here, there come moments of calmness, perhaps,  
when we see before us the death of one we loved, when some shock comes to us,  
or when extreme blessedness comes to us. Many other occasions there are when  
the mind, as it were, becomes calm, feels for the moment its real nature; and  
a glimpse of the Infinite beyond, where words cannot reach nor the mind go, is  
revealed to us.**   
 **Consciousness is bound by the senses**. Beyond that, beyond the senses, men  
must go in order to arrive at truths of the spiritual world, and there are  
even now persons who succeed in going beyond the bounds of the senses. These  
are called Rishis, because they come face to face with spiritual truths.   
 **Any attempt to modernise our women, if it tries to take our women away from  
that ideal of Sita, is immediately a failure, as we see every day.** The women  
of India must grow and develop in the footprints of Sita, and that is the only  
way.   
 **A great landmark in the history of religion is here, the ideal of love for  
love 's sake, work for work's sake, duty for duty's sake, and it for the first  
time fell from the lips of the greatest of Incarnations, Krishna, and for the  
first time in the history of humanity, upon the soil of India.** The religions  
of fear and of temptations were gone for ever, and in spite of the fear of  
hell and temptation of enjoyment in heaven, came the grandest of ideals, love  
for love's sake, duty for duty's sake, work for work's sake.   
 _There was a book written a year or two ago by a Russian gentleman, who  
claimed to have found out a very curious life of Jesus Christ, and in one part  
of the book he says that Christ went to the temple of Jagannath to study with  
the Brahmins, but became disgusted with their exclusiveness and their idols,  
and so he went to the Lamas of Tibet instead, became perfect, and went home.   
To any man who knows anything about Indian history, that very statement proves  
that the whole thing was a fraud, because the temple of Jagannath is an old  
Buddhistic temple. We took this and others over and re-Hinduised them. We  
shall have to do many things like that yet. That is Jagannath, and there was  
not one Brahmin there then, and yet we are told that Jesus Christ came to  
study with the Brahmins there. So says our great Russian archaeologist._   
 _This one great Northern sage, Chaitanya, represented the mad love of the  
Gopis._ Himself a Brahmin, born of one of the most rationalistic families of  
the day, himself a professor of logic fighting and gaining a word-victory   
for, this he had learnt from his childhood as the highest ideal of life and  
yet through the mercy of some sage the whole life of that man became changed;  
he gave up his fight, his quarrels, his professorship of logic and became one  
of the greatest teachers of Bhakti the world has ever known  mad Chaitanya.   
His Bhakti rolled over the whole land of Bengal, bringing solace to every one.  
His love knew no bounds. The saint or the sinner, the Hindu or the Mohammedan,  
the pure or the impure, the prostitute, the streetwalker  all had a share in  
his love, all had a share in his mercy: and even to the present day, although  
greatly degenerated, as everything does become in time, his sect is the refuge  
of the poor, of the downtrodden, of the outcast, of the weak, of those who  
have been rejected by all society. But at the same time I must remark for  
truth's sake that we find this: In the philosophic sects we find wonderful  
liberalisms.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Nisargadatta Maharaj says jnani is not concerned with future  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 04, 2010, 10:10:32 AM  
---  
**Q: Question   
M: Response By Nisargadatta Mahara**   
Q: I was told that the liberating action of satsang is automatic. Just like a  
river carries one to the estuary, so the subtle and silent influence of good  
people will take me to reality.   
M: It will take you to the river, but the crossing is your own. Freedom cannot  
be gained nor kept without will-to-freedom. You must strive for liberation;  
the least you can do is uncover and remove the obstacles diligently. **If you  
want peace you must strive for it. You will not get peace just by keeping  
quiet.**   
Q: A child just grows. He does not make plans for growth, nor has he a  
pattern; nor does he grow by fragments, a hand here a leg there; he grows  
integrally and unconsciously.   
M: Because he is free of imagination. You can also grow like this, but you  
must not indulge in forecasts and plans, born of memory and anticipation. **It  
is one of the peculiarities of a jnani that he is not concerned with the  
future. Your concern with future is due to fear of pain and desire for  
pleasure, to the jnani all is bliss: he is happy with whatever comes.**   
Q: Surely, there are many things that would make even a jnani miserable   
M: A jnani may meet with difficulties, but they do not make him suffer.  
Bringing up a child from birth to maturity may seem a hard task, but to a  
mother the memories of hardships are a joy. There is nothing wrong with the  
world. What is wrong is in the way you look at it. It is your own imagination  
that misleads you. Without imagination there is no world. Your conviction that  
you are conscious of a world is the world. The world you perceive is made of  
consciousness; what you call matter is consciousness Itself. You are the space  
(akash) in which it moves, the time in which it lasts, the love that gives it  
life. Cut off imagination and attachment and what remains?   
Q: What for are all these distinctions -- reality and illusion, wisdom and  
ignorance, saint and sinner? Everyone is in search of happiness, everyone  
strives desperately; everyone is a Yogi and his life a school of wisdom. Each  
learns his own way the lessons he needs. Society approves of some, disapproves  
of others; there are no rules that apply everywhere and for all time.   
M: In my world love is the only law. I do not ask for love, I give it. Such is  
my nature.   
Q: Is not attention an attitude of mind?   
M: Yes, when the mind is eager for reality, it gives attention. There is  
nothing wrong with your world, it is your thinking yourself to be separate  
from it that creates disorder. **Selfishness is the source of all evil.**   
Q: I am coming back to my question. Before I was born, did my inner self  
decide the details of my life, or was it entirely accidental and at the mercy  
of heredity and circumstances?   
M: Those who claim to have selected their father and mother and decided how  
they are going to live their next life may know for themselves. I know for  
myself. I was never born.   
Q: Sir, have you any wants or wishes. Can I do anything for you?   
M: What can you give me that I do not have? **Material things are needed for  
contentment. But I am contented with myself. What else do I need?**   
Q: Can one believe himself to be realised and be mistaken?   
M: Of course. The very idea 'I am self-realised' is a mistake. There is no 'I  
am this'. 'I am that' in the Natural State.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Dayananda Saraswati

http://www.satyarthprakash.com/   
Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati(February 12, 1824  October 31, 1883) **was an  
important Hindu religious scholar, reformer and the founder of the Arya Samaj,  
"Society of Nobles", a Hindu reform movement, founded in 1875.**   
**He was the first man who gave the call for Swarajya - "India for Indians" in  
1876 which was later furthered by Lokmanya Tilak.** Denouncing idolatry and  
ritualistic worship prevalent in Hinduism at the time, he worked towards  
reviving Vedic ideologies, subsequently philosopher and President of India, S.  
Radhakrishnan, later called him one of "makers of Modern India" as did Sri  
Aurobindo.   
One of his notable disciples was Shyamji Krishna Varma who founded India House  
in London and guided other revolutionaries like Madam Cama, Veer Sawarkar,  
Lala Hardyal, Madan Lal Dhingra, Bhagat Singh and others. His other disciples  
were Swami Shraddhanand, Lala Lajpat Rai and others who got their inspiration  
from his writings.   
**His book Satyarth Prakash contributed to the Indian independence movementis  
one of his great contributions.**   
He was a sanyasi (ascetic) from his boyhood, and a scholar, who believed in  
the infallible authority of the Vedas.   
Among Maharishi Dayananda's contributions are his promoting of the equal  
rights of women - such as the right to education and reading of Indian  
scriptures - and his translation of the Vedas from Sanskrit to Hindi so that  
the common person may be able to read the Vedas.   
Dayananda was born on on February 12 in 1824, in the village of Tankara near  
Morvi (Morbi) in the Kathiawar region (present Rajkot district), of the  
princely state of Gujarat, into a affluent and devout Brahmin family of  
Krishna Lal Tiwari and Yashodabai.   
**Swami Dayananda 's creation, the Arya Samaj, is a unique contribution in  
Hinduism.** The Arya Samaj unequivocally condemns idol-worship, animal  
sacrifices, ancestor worship, pilgrimages, priestcraft, offerings made in  
temples, the caste system, untouchability, child marriages and discrimination  
against women on the grounds that all these lacked Vedic sanction. The Arya  
Samaj discourages dogma and symbolism and encourages skepticism in beliefs  
that run contrary to common sense and logic. To many people, the Arya Samaj  
aims to be a "universal society" based on the authority of the Vedas.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ The Victory of the Little Squirrel

When coming to the rescue of Sita, Shri Rama was aided by Hanuman and the army  
of monkeys. They needed to build a bridge to cross the waters from India to  
Lanka where Sita was imprisoned. To do so, the monkeys began carrying huge  
boulders down from the hills and depositing them in the water.   
Seeing such devotion in their work, a small squirrel was inspired to help.  
Yet, when he offered his help, he was laughed at by the monkeys. Being so  
small, how he could help to do such a task, they asked.   
Instead of being discouraged, the small squirrel ran down to the sea and  
immersed himself in the water. Completely wet, he began to roll in the sand,  
so it would stick to his body. He then quickly ran to where the bridge was  
being formed and shook himself off, so that all the grains of sand he had  
collected would fall off amongst the huge boulders and contribute to the grand  
task. He continued to do so again and again.   
Shri Rama noticed his work. Rama was so moved by the squirrels determination  
that he took the small animal in his hands and blessed him by stroking his  
back with three of his fingers. And that is why even today the Indian squirrel  
shows this blessing by wearing three stripes on its back.   
 **Everyone has different gifts and capacities. We should try to perform to  
the best of our ability however difficult the task may be.**

Dear prasanth,   
Yes. Everyone should put forth their best capacities whether in   
the matters of self improvement or self enquiry or for good of   
others. Only our goal should be noble.   
Arunachala Siva.

They kept one of the stones which were used to form a bridge in a Hanuman  
temple in Rameshwaram. The stone is kept in a water tank where u can touch and  
see.These stones are floating in water. And there we could see a photograh of  
the bridge which is under water is taken from statelite. The pandits said this  
is the same bridge which Hanuman build it.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
There is a raging battle of words, between Tamil Nadu government   
and Hindu organizations about this bridge. The bridge was really   
man made or made by the monkey-armies of Sri Rama. But to   
say that this is a natural formation, is a travesty of truth.   
The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu put his foot into his mouth,   
by saying, Was Rama an engineer to build this?   
Why should someone be an engineer from any these hundreds of colleges that we  
see today? Then in which case -   
1\. How was the tower of Thanjavur Big Temple built? Which   
engineer rolled up the 20 tons cupola on the towers, about   
230 feet from ground?   
2\. How was the Grand Anicut built? This dam is functional even   
today after 10 centuries!   
3\. How was Taj Mahal built with such a mathematical accuracy?   
Was there engineering colleges during Shah Jehan's time?   
4\. How was the Chidambaram golden tower built. It has got   
gold plates, nuts, screws, cupolas, each representing some yogic truth!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji,   
If we go various temples in Tamil Nadu, we can find so many unique works in  
stones and temples. I used to wonder how these could be built where there was  
no roads, no crains. There was only man power. In Chennai there is a  
Vaitheeswaran temple in Poonamalee. During Masi month (Maga masam) the sun  
rays will fall on Shiva linga directly for 3 days, 23, 24 and 25. The preist  
says Sun worships Linga during this time.   
In Kalahasti there is no wind in Garbhagraha still the flame of light always  
shaking as if there is some breeze.   
In the same way, in Jambhukeswaram, we can see there is water on Linga. Like  
this there are plenty of secrets still an ordinary man cannot find. In tamil  
saying they say NAMBINAVANUKU NATARAJAN, NAMBADAVANUKKU KALLU.   
Those who have faith, they see God in everywhere.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
There are hundreds of such mysteries. The masons and artisans   
those days had the purity in their hearts and with God's grace,   
they built these marvelous pieces. There was of course some   
yogi or a learned priest nearby to guide them. In Thanjavur   
Big Temple, the Big Lingam could not stand on the base,   
(avadai) steadily and it was wobbling. The King Raja Raja could   
not understand why and he was so miserable. He called the   
Yogi, one Karuvurar. He was sitting on an outer portal and was   
singing Siva's praise, chewing pan at the same time. On King's   
request, he came to the sanctum sanctorum. The Big Lingam was   
lifted a few inches, and Karuvurar spat his red saliva of pan betel   
nut mixture on the cavity. Then he asked the King to tell the   
artisans to place the Lingam. The Lingam stood steadily and then   
they plastered the surroundings with herbal juices! There is   
a small shrine for Karuvurar in that temple even today.   
There are many such mysteries in Hindu Temples of South India.   
There is a pillar in Belur, Karnataka. This was built by King Chalukya. This  
is cylindrical structure, about 30 feet high and base   
as big as a drainage lid that you see on the roads today.   
If you place a paper, under it, it goes and comes out! That   
means the pillar is not standing on the base but a centimetre   
or so, above the base! How can it stand on the thin air? It   
never wobbles even during a storm. Such engineering skills were   
available with South Indian artisans those days.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Yes. It is only having faith which works like mystery. Moving from south here  
I want to tell about Kamar ali   
Darvesh levitating stone of shivapur near puna. People can lift this heavy  
stone with a index finger.   
There is a site where You can visit also.   
 There is also one story about sufi Darvesh. Very interesting. All over India  
we do have like this type of stones which tells stories based on faith. It  
seems people before 2 to 4 centuries had faith on them as well as God. They  
left behind some records on stones which is still alive and teaches to coming  
generations. I request this forum members to share their experiences where  
they visted such temples.
