Swami Sivananda Saraswati (September 8, 1887âJuly 14, 1963) was a Hindu  
spiritual teacher and a well known proponent of Sivananda Yoga and Vedanta.   
Sivananda was born Kuppuswami in Pattamadai, **in the Tirunelveli district of  
Tamil Nadu.**   
He studied medicine and served in Malaya as a physician for several years  
before taking up monasticism. He lived most of the later part of his life near  
Muni Ki Reti, Rishikesh.   
He is the founder of The Divine Life Society (1936), Yoga-Vedanta Forest  
Academy (1948) and author of over 200 books on yoga, vedanta and a variety of  
other subjects. He established Sivananda Ashram, the location of the  
headquarters of The Divine Life Society (DLS), on the bank of the Ganges at  
Shivanandanagar, at a distance of 3 kilometres from Rishikesh.   
Sivananda Yoga, the yoga form propagated by him, are now spread in many parts  
of the world through Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres, but these centres are not  
affiliated with Swami Sivananda's original ashrams which are run by the Divine  
Life Society.   
After a few years, Sivananda went on an extensive pilgrimage and traveled the  
length and breadth of India to meditate at holy shrines and study with  
spiritual teachers throughout India. During this Parivrajaka (wandering monk)  
life, Sivananda visited important places of pilgrimage in the south, including  
Rameshvaram. He conducted Sankirtan and delivered lectures during his travels.  
He visited the Sri Aurobindo Ashram and met Maharishi Suddhananda Bharati.   
**At the Ramana ashram, he had the Darshan of Ramana Maharshi on Maharshi 's  
birthday.He sang bhajans and danced in ecstasy with Maharshi's bhaktas.  
He also went on pilgrimages to various places in northern India including  
Kedarnath and Badrinath. He visited Kailash-Manasarovar in 1931.   
Swami Sivananda's two foremost disciples were Swami Chidananda and Swami  
Krishnananda. Swami Chidananda was appointed President of the Divine Life  
Society by Swami Sivananda in 1963 and served in this capacity until his death  
in 2008.   
Swami Krishnananda was appointed General Secretary of the Divine Life Society  
by Swami Sivananda in 1958 and served in this capacity until his death in  
2001. Swami Krishnananda is widely regarded as one of the most influential  
theologians and philosophers of the 20th century.   
A prolific author, Swami Sivananda wrote exactly 296 books on a variety of  
subjects: metaphysics, Yoga, religion, western philosophy, psychology,  
eschatology, fine arts, ethics, education, health, sayings, poems, epistles,  
autobiography, biography, stories, dramas, messages, lectures, dialogues,  
essays and anthology.Yet his books emphasized the practical application of  
yoga philosophy over mere theoretical knowledge.   
**He was known to have said "An ounce of practice is better than tons of  
theory. Practice Yoga, Religion and Philosophy in daily life and attain Self-  
realization."**   
Swami Sivananda died on 14 July 1963 in his Kutir on the bank of Ganges, in  
Shivanandanagar.

Dear SLakshmi,   
Many singers and great poets have become dumbfounded in the   
presence of Bhagavan Ramana. Not because they are afraid.   
They only become choked with emotions. They could not sing   
or read their poems. It is like lighting a candle before the Sun.   
However, Bhagavan Ramana encouraged them all. He told   
Sampurnamma: Even if you do not understand head or tail, it   
does not matter, please read Ribhu Gita. Muruganar, the great   
poet (he was a Tamil teacher) came with a poem before Bhagavan   
Ramana when he came for the first time. It was Desika Padigam   
in Sri Ramana Sannidhi Murai. Muruganar could not read even   
one line properly. Bhagavan Ramana said: "Oye, please give that   
paper to me." And then He read the poem written on Himself by   
Muruganar.   
Many great Tamil pandits cannot read the first Benedictory Verse   
of ULLadu Narpadu in one stretch without getting stuck. The words   
are closely packed and reading is very difficult. Understanding it   
is much more difficult.   
There is also one story about Professional Wailers. About this   
later....   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear SLakshmi,   
You know when Bhagavan Ramana was in the Hill, in total mounam,   
someone broke the coconut on His head also. This incomparable   
Brahma Jnani was keeping silent and enjoying the cool coconut   
water dripping from His head to the cheeks.   
In Sri Vaishnava Sampradaya, there is one practice. When a Sri   
Vaishnava sannyasi (they call them Jeers, as you might have heard   
in Tirupati). When they leave the body, the devotees break a coconut on his  
head. If the skull breaks quickly, even before the   
coconut breaks, with one or two blows, it is said, that the   
particular Vaishna Sannyasi has attained realization!   
Arunachala Siva.

Bhagavan Ramana was achalam, non moving. Muruganar says: Even Arunachala, the non moving Hill is quite shameful to see   
your greater non moving capacity! Achalame NaaNa achalamai   
irunthavane....   
1\. Some urchin passed urine on His back.   
2\. Some other fellow threw cowdung or some excreta on His back.   
3\. Some urchins pelted stones at Him.   
4\. Some bogus sadhus moved the rocks from higher level of the   
Hill so that these would roll down and hit Him.   
5\. Some sadhu applied green chilli paste on His body.   
6\. Someone tried to drop the cactus plant juice on His open   
eyes with a vacant gaze. (of course, this was not done).   
7\. One boy wanted to take His torn towel saying wittingly, "The   
Governor wants Your towel. Please give."   
8\. Only one boy saw Him and wept and then told Him to come to   
his boss so that he would give a job to Him, for the fees of 1   
paise per day! (That was the coolie fees in those days for child   
labour per day!)   
Bhagavan Ramana stood as achalam. Achalame NaaNa achalamai   
irunthavane....   
Arunachala Siva.

I read some books where it is said, when the life force leaves through the  
skull it is called KAPALA MOKHAM.   
Some sadhus know their ending so they would tell their followers what should  
done when he sits in samadhi.   
Some rare cases the skull would split then immedietly their followers put  
vibudhi, pachai karpuram etc. etc.   
then they close with mud and install Lingam. For some reason when it does not  
split followers would break   
coconut as desired by the sanyasis. Main dying will take place when our mind  
dies. That is important. It happened for Bhagavan Ramana.

I typed wrongly the word Mokham. It is Moksham.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
What you say is true. In Yoga marga, the prana power breaks   
open the crown and leaves and there will be breaking of the   
skull. Saint poetess Avvaiyar says in her Vinayakar Ahaval: "Karuthinil kapal vayil kaatti...."   
Arunachala Siva.
