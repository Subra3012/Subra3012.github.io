23. The Self is of the nature devoid of waking state. It is without the dream state. The Self is of the form   
of bliss and perfect. Besides the Self there is nothing.   
24. The Self is the past. Again the Self is of the future. The Self is the imperishable. The Self is the form   
of consciousness. The Self is the form devoid of beginning and middle.  
Besides the Self there is nothing.   
25. The Self is without all types of thought, clear, just consciousness and undiminishing. The Self is   
devoid of knower, knowable, and such. Besides the Self there is nothing.   
26. The singular Self, the Self devoid of one, is rid of duality and non duality. The Self is oneself.   
The Self is natural. Besides the Self there is nothing.   
27\. The Self that is the fourth state is also the eternal Self. Whatever  
trifling is here, it is the Self.   
The Self is the measure. The Self is without measure. Besides the Self there  
is nothing.   
28. The Self of the many is the limit of words. Rejoicing within, it is the joy of speech. The Self is   
without all. The Self is all. There is nothing besides the Self.   
29. See the Self alone. Meditate within yourself. Enjoy yourself within yourself. Verily, there is nothing   
besides the Self.   
30. Be happy within yourself. You yourself are the Self. Look at the Self yourself, listen to the Self   
yourself.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
