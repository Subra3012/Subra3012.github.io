## Tripura Rahasya - Tale of three cities

Tripura or Three Cities are the ones which Siva burnt, with   
his smile. There were three demons called Tarakaksha, Kamalksha,   
and Vidhyunmali. They were flying with their cities, on the sky,   
and descended to many places and killed the residents at will.   
The three cities were made up of gold, silver and iron. These cities   
will converge in the sky once in 3000 years. The demons can be   
killed only at such a time, with a single arrow. The gods were   
as usual suffering and they came to Siva. They made the earth   
as the chariot, sun and moon as wheels, four vedas as four horses, Brahma as a  
charioteer, Adisesha as arc of the bow, Mount   
Meru as the bow, and Vishnu as the arrow. The chariot got stuck.   
Siva was about to descend from the chariot. Narayana came   
as bull, to raise the wheels that were stuck up. Siva ascended   
the bull, and smiled at the Tripura, and the three cities got   
burnt with death of three demons.   
This is also described by Sri Sankara, in Sri Sivananda Lahari,   
Verse 4.   
O Siva, you are beyond the three Vedas, but pleasant to my   
Heart, you are the destroyer of three cities, you are having   
three eyes, large matted locks, serpent garlands and a deer   
on your hand. You are the best among the gods, and you   
are the refuge of Jivas. Please come and stay in my Heart,   
with Mother when I meditate.   
This Tripura or three cities, are metaphorically only three   
bodies, viz., gross body, subtle body and causal body. Or,   
it can also metaphorically mean the three impurities, viz.,   
anava, (ego), kanma (karma) and maya.   
Saint Tirumular says in Verse 343 of Tiru Mandiram: Only the fools would say that Siva, destroyed the three cities.   
He is the god of red matted locks,   
What is three cities, they are the three impurities,   
Who can do this destruction? What will happen to them,   
 only they have to tell, how can I tell?   
Muppuram avadhu mummala karyam... he says in Tamil Verse.   
Munagla Venkatramaiah has elaborted this metaphorical insights   
into his work Triupura Rahasya. (Sri Ramanasrmam). There   
is also recently a Tamil work published by Sri Ramanasramam,   
in 2006. This Tripura Rahasyam, in a translation in Tamil from   
the original Sanskrit work, by Sri V. R. Subramania Iyer, the   
gentleman who has also written the book Ellam Onre, All is   
One. All is One has been prescribed for Annamalai Swami   
for Bhagavan Ramana for reading daily. I think He has copied   
it in His own hand writing for Annamalai Swami.   
Arunachala Siva.

Lord Parameswara is glorified for three important and superlative feats  
a)Tripura samharam b) Destruction of Daksha Yagnam c) Swallowing the deadly  
poison that emerged on churning for Nectar. Many principles or concepts are  
enunciated out of such mythological events which are highly valuable. But to  
discard them as cock and bull story or fiction is not proper. Doubts are  
expressed whether Ramayana actually took place or just a moral story to teach  
not to covet another man's wife.Fortunately,there are still some historical  
vestiges to prove the existence of places connected with Ramayana. Not so for  
such happenings outside the orbit of earth-heaven or or some lokas.We have to  
believe the words of great saints who in all their hymns and verses  
repeatedly recall the glory of God by referring to the events described in  
various Puranas. As long as we believe in names and forms, let us respect the  
matters narrated in Purana to enrich our devotion.May be after reaching the  
level of Tirumoolar,we will pierce the facade and hold on to the  
principles/philosophies behind the Puranas.

Dear arcsekar,   
Yes. As Tirumular said "only they can tell, how can I tell?"   
That is, only when a person has conquered the three impurities   
can tell what it is like, and not we. As you have correctly said,   
so long as we believe in names and forms, these puranic stories   
have to be belived in full faith. Once when the three impurities   
are transcended, then we can understand the metaphoric insights   
of these puranic stories.   
For example there is a story in Sri Arunachala Puranam. Siva   
came to the local king, as a Bairva Sannyasi and told him: "I want a woman tonight, for my bed, since I have sex only   
once in 6 months." The king searched for the local harlots   
and everyone was busy that night, already prebooked! The   
king had to give his wife! The wife also agreed. The Bairava   
Sannyasi went into the royal bedroom. The king's wife came   
to embrace him and suddenly the old Sannyasi became a   
child of 3 months in her hands. The royal couple had no   
issues and thus they were granted this boon, through a sport   
of Siva. Even today Arunachaleswara does yearly ceremonies   
for the royal couple, since they were his mother and father.   
On first hearing this story in Tiruvannnamalai, my wife   
shouted: "O this Siva is the worst scoundrel of the first   
water!" Next morning, one gentleman in Asramam explained: "This is to test the ego of the king. When asking the king   
to give a harlot or ultimately his own wife, Siva was only   
asking for his ego and his wife's self respect. When given, Siva became their  
son and took care of the ceremonies after their death, as a dutiful son.   
Krishna asking the gopikas to come out of Yamuna river naked   
and take back their clothes, is also the same.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Sri Arunachala Akshara Mana Malai,   
Verse 77: Accepting those who approach you with attachment, destroy   
their individuality and then shine free from wrong attachment   
and identity with individuals, Oh Arunachala!   
 (Tr. Prof. K. Swaminathan)   
Arunachala Siva.

As you know, one of the greatest works of Bhagavan containing the quint  
esscence of Vedanta is Upadesa Undhiyar-Tamil version/Upadesa Saram -in  
Sanskrit.Here, Lord Siva preaches an illuminating sermon to the disillusioned  
Risihis of Daraukavana,. Preamble to this episode narrates how Siva went nude  
and enticed the wives of Rishis and set them at naught. Such acts of Siva,many  
can not stomach.Yet it was necessary to punish and teach the arrogant Rishis a  
lesson. At the end,what we got is a great upadesa,very powerful messages,  
which Bhagavan has adapted and composed well in Upadesa Saram /Upadesa  
Undhiyar.

There are other stories also where Shiva destroyed Andhagasura. Shiva created  
64 bairavas to kill him. Now only 8 bairavas there in few temples.   
But in all shiva temple they have at least one kalabaira. In the same way  
Shiva destroyed the pride of Rishis who were living in tharukavanam near  
Thillai.   
In all stories Shiva only destroys the ego and give enlightenment to all.   
Can you tell me what is the symbol for having Man (deer) and Mazhu where shiva  
is having. He did the Gaja samharam. The temple is in vazhuvur near tanjore.  
Here we can have veerateswar.All the Leelas happened only in Thamilnadu. That  
is why in temple they say Thennadudaiya Shivane porri Ennatavarkum erriva  
porri

Dear arcsekar,   
Yes. There are such stories. These are there in all religions.   
In the Bible there are certain stories and passages which may   
cause some revulsion. Irving Wallace's "The Word", a great   
novel of 1980s speak about it. The Tarukavanam story is in   
Chidambara Mahatmyam, Kunchitangristavam and Skandam.   
The first two are by Umapathi Sivam of Chidambaram, who   
was learned in Sanskrit and Tamil. The story goes like this: Seeing naked Siva and Mohini (Narayana) the wives of rishis   
and rishis themselves got infatuated. The wives ran to Siva,   
without even bothering their sarees falling and blouses tearing off,   
due to swelling breasts.... Rishis shouted at Siva. Siva said: What is it that bothers you? Is it my penis? He plucked the   
penis and threw it to the sky! Siva says that karmas have given   
only this much knowledge for you. Karmas show that your ego   
and self respect are not yet killed. Now listen to my words of   
upadesa. Only Jnana vichara can liberate you....   
Then comes the famous Upadesa Saram, of Bhagavan Ramana.   
The original story appears in Skandam, Siva Rahasya Kandam.   
The other two are of post 15th century works.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
The Tarukavanam story, has been given by me, in my post   
to arcsekar. The tarukavanam story tells about the elephant   
sent by Rishis to kill Siva. Siva tore the elephant's skin   
and wore it as upper cloth. Then the tiger's skin is worn   
by Siva as his waist cloth. Even Uma was afraid of these   
ferocious killing says Tirunavukkarasar in his Tevaram. This   
Gajasamharam is depicted in the temple that you had mentioned.   
The deer in Nataraja's hand depicts the ever changing nature   
of mind. The fire denotes the agni of Jnana that can kill   
the ego. Man Kaatti man irkum thanmayaiyane... says   
Tevaram. By showing the deer, Siva attracts the minds of   
Jivas. It is like showing a deer in the jungle and enticing   
other deers as done by hunters.   
There are 8 bhairavas. Ashta bhairava, they are called.   
I do not know the details. The ashta virasthana sthalams,   
8 places of great valour (of Siva) are 8 Siva temples where   
Siva did such valourous acts. I shall give you the details   
in a separate post.   
Arunachala Siva.

What is the meaning of mazhu? There are so many types of Shiva. Each one has  
got one purana. Maily He comes to save His devotee and held   
different types of weapons for different type of situation. Long time ago you  
gave sapta vidangar's details.   
In the same way if you can write the stories of 63 nayanmars it would be a  
great feast for us.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Mazhu in Tamil means the Pick-axe. While Fire is seen in all   
Nataraja and Siva images, the deer, the pick axe and the hand-   
drum (Udukkai in Tamil) vary in various images.   
As regards Sapta Vidanga Sthalams, I have already written   
in some old posts. These are 7 places of different types   
of dances of Siva. As regards Ashta Veerasthanam, the 8   
places of ferocious killings, I shall write soon.   
As regards Nayanmars, I have already written in about 60 to   
70 serial posts about 6 months back. These have been re-   
located under Translations and Commentaries section. Kindly   
see.   
Arunachala Siva.
