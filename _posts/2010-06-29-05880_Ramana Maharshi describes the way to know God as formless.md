Sri Arunachala Ashtakam (Eight verses in praise of Arunachala)Verse 3: When I approach thinking of You (the Supreme Reality) as a form, You stand as  
a Hill on earth. If one thinks of (or meditates upon) Your form (Your real  
nature) as formless, one is like someone who wanders about the world in order  
to see the sky. Therefore, instead of trying to meditate upon You thus), when  
without thinking one,thinks of Your (Real) form (the existence-consciousness  
I am) (ones) form (or separate individuaity) will cease to exist like a  
sugar-form placed in the ocean. When I know myself, what else is my form (but  
you)? You, who were existing as the great Aruna Hill, (alone) are (and I, the  
separate individual, am not).   
Note : If oneself is a form (the body), the world and God will also be  
likewise. , says Sri Bhagavan in verse 4 of Ulladu Narpadu. That is, so long  
as we feel the name and form of a body to be 'I', we cannot know God as  
anything but a name and form. **Since meditation can be done only by the mind,  
and since the mind is that which feels I am the form of this body, meditation  
can be done only upon a form. Since all thoughts are nothing but forms, even  
the thought that God is formless is itself a form. Therefore it is impossible  
for the mind to do formless meditation or Nirguna-dhyana. That is why Sri  
Bhagavan says in the second line of this verse, if one thinks of (or meditates  
upon) your form as formless, one is like someone who wanders about the world  
in order to see the sky.**   
 **How then is one to know God as formless, as He really is? Only if we remain  
without thought - without even the first thought I am this body, I am so-and-  
so, can we realize God as formless. How to remain thus without even the first  
thought I? The only way is to attend to Self, because when the attention is  
withdrawn from all second and third person objects and fixed on the mere  
feeling 'I',no thought can rise. **Such self-attention is what is denoted here  
by the words, "when without thinking one thinks of Your (Real) Form (the  
existence-consciousness 'I am')". When, by thus attending to 'I', one remains  
without thought, the form of the mind (the feeling 'I am this body') will  
cease to exist, and the formless reality of God or Arunachala will then be  
experienced as it is.

Muruganar says in Guru Vachaka Kovai Verse 1058: Because of the excellence of Swarupam, he oneness in which the seer   
himself becomes the seeing, one's real nature is the most exalted.   
The 'I'-nature, the mauna-light in which the ego, the seer 'I', has completely  
died, is the Self, consciousness, the supreme.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Who am I?: You are the Self. You exist always. Nothing more can be predicated to the  
Self than that it exists. Seeing God or the Self is only being the Self or  
yourSelf. Seeing is being.   
Day by Day entry dated 17th October 1946 is as under:-   
Question: When a man realizes the Self, what will he see?   
Bhagavan: There is no seeing. Seeing is only being. The state   
of Self-realization, as we call it, is not attaining something new or reaching  
some goal which is far away, but simply being that which you always are and  
which you always have been. All that is needed is that you give up your  
realization of the not-true as true. All of us are realizing, i.e. regarding  
as real, that which is not real. We have only to give up this practice on our  
part. Then we shall realize the Self as the Self, or in other words, 'Be the  
Self.' At one stage one would laugh at oneself that one tried to discover the  
Self which is so self-evident. So, what can we say to this question?   
That stage transcends the seer and the seen. There is no seer to see anything  
and the Self alone remains.   
Arunachala Siva.
