Isanya Jnana Desikar's Samadhi is in Isanya Math, near Isanya Lingam in  
Tiruvannamalai. I visited this place during my recent   
visit to Tiruvannamalai. His Math is now being taken care of by   
Kovilur Math, whose Head fed Bhagavan Ramana on a day during His days.   
Isanya Jnana Desikar was born near Kanchipuram. His childhood   
name was Kandappan (Skanda). When he grew as a youth, he refused marriage and  
went away from home, with the blessings of the parents and lived in  
Tiruvannamalai. Several devotees, particularly one Muthuramalingam and  
Arunachala Chetty served him food and milk. He was constantly in Siva dhyana.  
Once one British by name Idan, met him and found Desikar playing with tigers  
as if they were kittens! He prayed to him and became his disciple! He wanted  
to donate huge amounts to Desikar which Desikar refused. The British then  
donated the amounts to Arunachaleswara Temple, as per Desikar's wish. Desikar  
once saved the British from drowning into the flash floods in a village river.   
Desikar at the appropriate time, took a seat facing South and prayed to Siva  
Nataraja and then merged into Siva Effulgence! The devotees   
then built a Samadhi for Desikar and installed a Siva Lingam. Desikar lived  
for about 79 years. His famous works are Swanubhava Mala,   
Jnana Kattalai (The Directions for Jnana), Annmalai Venba, Annamalai Kanni and  
Annamalai Stuti.

Dear munagala,   
I am not sure. I have not seen such flashes of light.   
Arunachala Siva.
