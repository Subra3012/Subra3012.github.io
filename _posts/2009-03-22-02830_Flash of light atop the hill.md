Kavyakanta Ganapati Sastri is known for his great poetic skills in   
Sanskrit. Once in a debate with Amba Datta in Navadweepa, he   
made the following quizzical poems: 1\. Parvati does not even see Siva's face twice in a month. Why?   
Ans: Because twice in a month, there is fourth day moon (chaturthi),   
when one should not see the moon on that day. Since Siva has got   
a crescent moon on His head, Parvati does not see Him for two days   
in a month.   
2. There is a girl is shamelssly showing her breasts to her   
father in law, on a hot summer evening. Who?   
Ans: Hitumbi, the wife of Bheema, is having persipiration on a summer  
evening. She removes her upperclothes to get some air   
by fanning with that uppercloth. Her father in law (Vayu - air)   
is seeing her bared breasts! Bheema is Vayuputra. Hence Vayu is   
Hitumbi's father in law!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear munagala,   
I am not sure. I have not seen such flashes of light.   
Arunachala Siva.
