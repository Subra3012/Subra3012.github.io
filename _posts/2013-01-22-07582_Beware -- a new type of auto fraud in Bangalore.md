Dear devotees,   
Please beware of this type of fraud done by some auto drives in Bangalore.   
On 28-Dec-2012 night, I was starting from Bangalore to Trichy by night bus.   
The bus is KSRTC volvo and I booked the boarding point as KMF Chirst College  
(muneshwara temple).   
I started from my home at Jayanagar to that KMF circle around 8:30 PM in the  
night.   
The distance is only small and charge will be around Rs 30 only generally.   
I called many auto and all rejected to come to that place. I was having heavy  
luggages. Finally one auto came and he told he will charge one and half.   
He was wearing vibudhi and kumkum as if painted in his forehead.   
The auto was unusually fast and I had an intuition that something we may lose  
in this trip. I was keeping tight my pan card and other articles. When  
desitination came, the meter read Rs 50 which is definitely very high as i am  
a regular traveller i know that.   
Also he stopped in a relatively dark place few yards away from the bustop.   
But still, i had to pay him Rs 75. I asked him if he has change for Rs 100.  
He said yes. When i gave a 100 rupee note, he told me that i had only given  
Rs 10 in darkness due to mistake, He was adamant in demanding another 100  
rupee note.   
Soon another auto driver joined him as if pre-planned. I sensed the dange of  
the situation if I futher protested, shelled out Rs 100 and walked as fast  
as I could carrying the heavy buggages and thinking of Ramana.   
I went and stood in the bustand, these 2 auto drivers were lauging at me and  
also they were still in that dark place smoking and discussing something.  
Then they vanished from site.   
Though I was sad that I lost Rs 100, I consoled myself that Ramana  
Maharishee saved me from a greater danger, say what if they looted my whole  
purse that has pan card and other credit cards.   
So, next time, please tender exact change to auto drivers. If you dont have  
change, use a torch light, show him the amount in a loud voice and then only  
exchange. Be very careful. Other city people and foreigners who visit  
India.

Dear Kskat   
It is not just in Bangalore, even in Chennai and other places these sort of  
things happen in very early morning or late night when there is poor  
visibility. I know of one lady who ended up giving Rs.500 instead of Rs.50/-  
.Best is for us to have exact change or better be bit magnanimous in giving a  
rounded figure to avoid the change problems i.e give Rs.50 instead of Rs.30  
and Rs.100 instead of Rs.80/-.   
It is good that u did not end up having your things robbed or stolen. Today  
apart from Jewels, Smart Phones, Laptops, High End Tablets, Cameras  
,Watches, ATM /Credit Cards are also robbed /stolen. These happen not just in  
Bus standa but also in A/C Compartment in Trains and also in Domestic Flights  
with their Cabin luggage. Sometimes the culprits come as co passengers or co  
passengers become culprits we do not know. **So even A/C Compartment in  
Trains and Flights are no guarantee for absolute safety and we need to be  
careful at all places and also pray the almighty to enjoy a robbery free  
journey. **

namaḥ sahamānāya nivyādhina āvyādhinīnāṁ pataye namo   
namaḥ kakubhāya niṣaṅgiṇe stenānāṁ pataye namaḥ.   
Prostration to the valiant Confronter of foes; the terrific Uprooter of the  
opposing forces, the Protector of the powers (of dharma) pressing from all  
sides; prostration to the Lord seated on the hump of the bull, armed with the  
sword, the Chief of (even) thieves (or stealer of everyones heart).   
Note:The appellation Chief of thieves is to indicate the supreme immanence  
and the non-exclusiveness of the Divine Being.   
namo niṣaṅgiṇa iṣudhimate taskarāṇāṁ pataye namo   
namo vañcate parivañcate stāyūnāṁ pataye namo   
namo nicerave paricarāyāraṇyānāṁ pataye namo.   
Prostration to the Chief of robbers, to Him who is armed with quiver and  
arrows; prostration to the deceiving, the tricky and elusive Lord of  
marauders; prostration to the ever-cunning Leader of the thieves lurking at  
home and those wandering in the streets and the forests.   
Note:The Lord is adored as the Chief of thieves, etc., in two senses.  
Firstly, He is the indwelling presence of even the thieves, and their lives  
are impossible without His existence in them as their essence. Secondly, He is  
also the jiva, which is the thief, apart from His being Isvara ranging beyond  
the realm of the former. Also, the Lord it is that sports as the high and low,  
the good and the bad, the virtuous and the debased, when looked at from the  
standpoint of the universe taken as a whole, a view which is hard for the jiva  
sunk in personalistic cognitions and perceptions but the right vision of those  
who are absorbed in Reality. Ethical concepts stand transfigured in the  
Absolute. These mantras of the Veda are to help the seeker in recognising God  
through the medium of all creation.   
(This is copied from the translation of Satarudriyam by Sri Krishnanda  
Swamiji. Here is the link for those who may wish to see it: http://swami-  
krishnananda.org/invoc/in_sata.html)   
Like we all do, i too once faced a similar situation which left me angry,  
scared and helpless. Then one day, i happened to listen to a pravachanam (in  
Telugu) by Sri Chaganti Koteswara Rao garu, who mentioned the above two slokas  
while relating an incident and explained how one could get rid of the  
unpleasant memories by understanding that this too is the play of Siva. Those  
words were the antidote i needed to put me out of misery and it quickly  
pacified me. I hope, although your learned self may already be aware, this may  
be of some consolation   
Yours in Bhagavan,   
Abhilash Ayyagari

For all Auto needs in Bangalore which are planned in advance please use  
http://autowale.in/. Very reliable service. Just ensure you give 15 mins extra  
notice, as they invariable turn up 5-10 mins (not more) late - of course,  
traffic issues in Bangalore. But very nice service.
