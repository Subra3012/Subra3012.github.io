Once Zen Master Settanb was invited to a certain monastery to   
lecture on a Zen classic. The baron of the province attended the   
talk, seated behind a screen.   
When settan got up onto the lecture stand and saw the screen,   
he shouted. "Who is this impudent fellow, listening from behind   
a screen? There is no chaff at my lectures, so there is no need   
for a sieve! Unless you get that winnowing basket out of here,   
there will be no talk today!"   
Everyone in the audience went pale. The baron was extremely   
embarassed. Apologizing to the Zen Master profusely, he had   
the screen removed and sat there listening to the talk along   
with every one else.

Torio Tokun said: "Do not consider yourself elevated in comparison   
to ordinary people. Those who are commonplace, just rise and fall   
on the road of fame and profit without practising the Way or following   
the Way.   
"They are not only to be pitied, not despised or resented. Do   
not give rise to judgmental thoughts, by comparing yourself   
to them. Do not give rise to ideas of higher and lower."   
"This is the attitude needed to enter the Way of the Sages and   
Saints, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. Therefore, we place ourselves   
in the state of ordinary people, assimilating to the ordinary, while   
our will is on the Way, and we investigate its wonders."   
This is called the Lotus in the mud attitude.

**Dear Member,   
I have carried deep reverence for the Ramana Ashram after visiting this serene  
and sacred place in 1993.   
After working as an educationist and a trainer in the behavioral field, now at  
57, I have more less relinquished commerce and have shifted to a serene locale  
in West Bengal called Santiniketan, from Delhi. Strangely, despite earning  
some worthwhile respect and love of many many students and clients, I hardly  
saved money. I am single and maintain a fairly clean life with keen interest  
in literature and spiritual studies. I have been deeply infulenced by Tagore's  
Geetanjali and other songs which have mystic roots in the Upanishads and  
Vedantic doctrines. I also read with great excitement 'An autobiography of a  
Yogi', 'Tibet's great yogi Milarepa', 'The power of Now' and the complete  
explanation of Bhagabat Geeta by Swami Chinmayanada. I have always been on and  
off with Bible and feel great love for Jesus Christ. When I was very  
young(1968), all by accident I received initiation in the Sri Ramakrishna  
order by a saintly person who was a family man but hardly followed my rituals.  
Except a few days of close company with my Guru, I did not develop my deep  
love and association with him.   
I have always taken my life as a robust adventure, taken fearless risks and  
suffered major financial and emotional set backs. But, I have generally been  
sincere and honest to self and faithful to God. This was perhaps one reason  
why I was neither shaken off the ground nor worsted. I am without any capital  
or resources now but feel steady and excited to pursue a positive way of life.  
My inner inkling guides me to feel that I shall find my way to travel fully in  
the spiritual track with complete dedication and must attain self-realization.  
Although, I admit that I have not studied much of the literatures of Sri  
Ramana Maharishi, but I don't know why I feel a deep calling in my heart for  
the master and thought i shall find a place at his lotus feet at the Raman  
Ashram. I had nurtured a silent desire to stay and work for the Ramana Ashram  
one day.   
I have found very enlightened people in this fraternity and became its member  
only yesterday. You may agree, the spiritual quest is very discrete and serene  
and it is difficult to get a true friend with whom you can relate and ask some  
questions. I am a bit restless now and have a few questions. Will any  
enlihghtened and advanced member who are sure of guiding me properly help me  
with his or her views? My questions are:**  
i) Do you think I need a Guru? But, I don't want a ritualistic Guru who will  
initiate me and I won't get his direct company. I also feel, I would mature  
into meeting the Guru, rather than searching for one!   
ii) Will the Ramana Ashram and its ideology be the right answer to my quest?  
Is it based on meditation-yoga or gyan-yoga or bhakti-yoga (while all should  
be integral, I wanted to know what was the primary mode practised here)?   
iii) Finally, is it possible to permanently stay and work in the ashram?   
I eagerly await some valuable guidance, please.   
With sincere love and regards,

My dear Asit Ghosh,   
Your post.   
1\. Since you have already been initiated into some practices by the   
disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, I sincerely feel that you can continue   
your practice. Being unfaithful to your Gure, you can always read   
the teachings and life of Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi. For that   
matter, both the orders extol Advaita. Bhagavan Ramana has told   
on a few occasions that unless there was an urgent inner call, there   
was no need to change Guru, which is again only a play of the mind   
and ego.   
2\. To stay in Sri Ramanasramam, Tiruvannamalai is possible with prior   
request and confirmation, for only three days. For a longer stay you   
have to find an accommodation in the hotels of Tiruvannamalai or become   
a paying guest for some residents. The stay in hotels would be expensive,   
since there is a large tourist population in Tiruvannamalai for seeing the   
Temple and the Asramam.   
3. Service and stay inside the Asramam, will be difficult since there are   
many many waiting in the queue and the authorities cannot avail the   
services of all.   
With love,   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ghoshorasit,   
Each individual is unique and his personality can never be the same as any  
other, therefore his spiritual quest also will be unique. Your path is the one  
which you will take, and that is that. The important thing is your sincerity  
and intensity of desire to find the truth, and the path and the Guru will be  
there.   
Also be very clear as to what you are seeking. Is it an expereince or are you  
seeking to make your life better by spiritual practise? Or are you seeking to  
know the truth about yourself, as an end in itself or for some other purpose?  
Anwsering these questions might give you an insight into your quest.   
I hope I have been of some help.   
May the blessings of Bhagavan and all the sages be always with you.

in my eyes ramana maharshi "bhagawan" is such an intense light and guide for  
the soul that he is guiding all seekers in our times (he is mentioned in all  
stories of awakening, also from buddhists, and alot of tibetan lamas quote  
him)   
I think that he will guide you anyway, he will guide oyu to teachers,  
meditations etc...   
he is doing this in my case, you see I do not follow a special religion or  
teacher...it is not neccessary...I just feel his presence and guidance..at the  
moment I study buddhism (tibetan) and you know what, in dzogchen meditation  
gnana marga is a quint essential part (mind meditating on mind)   
in the surath shabda tradition of baba faqir chant you meditate on the divine  
sound and also you practice a kind of slef inquery   
all the geniune ways have slef inquery as a part..it is essential.....

i think we don't have answers to another's quest / questions. Mararishi also  
left us to seek and find our way. Of course, grace of a guru helps. But then  
each one of us has our own sensitivities to these things. One may be moved to  
tears...another may sit like a rock. Spiritual quest may also be about  
heightening our sensitivities to the grace all around us...waiting to be  
tapped. Sometimes a friend may say something which goes right to the heart and  
he or she becomes a guru.   
when i was at the ashram sometime back i too felt like living and serving  
there. But i am not sure if it was a momentary impulse.   
sadhana is a must on the spiritual path. one could perhaps describe sadhana as  
the "efforts" required to make us "connect" with who we really are. Sadhana  
appears to be difficult at times...like a huge struggle. The blocks are  
perhaps to be found within us. once these dissolve (i hope), we become more  
receptive to the grace of the gurus all around us. Then all struggle / efforts  
cease....all questions become irrelevant.   
Right now, like a fellow being, i too am asking questions / seeking answers  
which i know shows my "disconnect" with guru / Self.

Dear vinita,   
Yes. Bhagavan Ramana only said to enquire, Who am I? and not   
Who are We? or Who are You? Each one, according to his inclination.   
But He said not to change the Guru, unless there is a strong inner   
call. The Guru need not be a living Guru, since the Guru is the Self   
and the self has no beginning, no end, ever present, beyond death and birth.  
For example, David Godman came to Tiruvannamalai many years after Bhagavan  
Ramana's Maha Nirvana.
