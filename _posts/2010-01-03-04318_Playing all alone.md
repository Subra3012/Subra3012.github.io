## Playing all alone

During childhood I often played games all alone.   
The easiest to play was the carrom board. Taking one color's side like white,  
each strike will scatter the board sufficiently so that when I went to the  
other side of the board to play for the other color coin, there is always a  
new setting.   
It was more difficult to play cards alone since it involves part luck and part  
tactics.   
So I chose those games which has more luck and less tactics.   
The most difficult was to play chess all alone. Whatever tactics I thought for  
white gets carried over with me when I went to the other side of the board to  
play for black. So naturally I was in a position to get a prick in conscience  
for partiality. The only thing I thought was to decide separate game  
strategies beforehand for white and black and stick to the strategies  
throughout the games. This makes the game play a play between strategies  
taking away my botheration about partiality.   
Then I read that a single God is playing the whole world game all alone  
through so may jivas.   
This made me wonder whether God is playing it like carrom board, card or  
chess.

Dear silentgreen,   
Nice post. One Western philosopher has said: God is playing dice   
for us! In fact, I have also played chess all by myself. I shall   
of course, try to work out strategies for both black and white, when-   
ever I shift to the particular side. It is no doubt difficult. I became   
the Chess Champion of the college for one year, and was given the   
book The Chess Mind - by Gerald Abrams.   
Very famous world chess players like Alekhine and Bobby Fisher   
were mad caps. Madness or religion has something to do with the   
chess. I left chess during my late 20s.   
Arunachala Siva.

One another game that I used to play in my college hostel days,   
(whenever I am bored with reading a text book), was to pick a   
page and see how many letters from a to z are there in that page.   
I found after some months, that k, x and z are the most rare letters   
on any page.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian.R,   
Nice observation. I thought that the letter "q" would be among the less  
occurring letters.   
Incidentally the thought came to me that chess board and pieces has some  
resemblance to Indian temples if arranged in this way: \- The four elephants with their lamp-like shapes to form four corner towers  
of the temples.   
\- The row of pawns to be serially arranged to form the boundary of the  
temple.   
\- The queens with their crowns looks like deities and can be placed at the  
middle of the board.   
\- The kings if put on top of boats and made taller can act as the temple  
"shikha", the middle tower of the temple.   
Now the question is where to put the horses?...with their heads slightly bent,  
they look like devotees.   
So they can be made to travel inside the temple compound.   
Now the black and white pieces need to cooperate instead of compete.   
The white pieces can form that side of the temple where sun rays are falling  
and blacks the shadowy side.   
The self of the devotee building the temple can act as the sun.   
In Periya Puranam a Nayanmar builds an entire Shiva temple in his mind.   
Then why can't the chess board also be used to build a temple?

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent imagery. The horses could also be various Vahanas (vehicles) of  
God.   
In Periya Puranam, different devotees have prayed to Siva in   
various fashions.   
1\. Poosalar Nayanar built the temple in his mind. Siva told the   
king that He would attend the consecration of Pusalar's temple   
first, and then come to his temple, which was built of finest   
stones and marbles.   
2. Sakkiya Nayanar threw stones at a Siva Linga, because he had   
already joined Jainism and the monks prevented him from doing   
pujas with flowers. Siva accepted his stones as flowers of gold.   
3\. Arivattya Nayanar offered to give Siva, the first received white   
rice and then whatever red rice (hand pound) that he had received   
as alms, took for his family food. Once, for a week or so, no red   
rice was forthcoming and all alms were only by way of white rice.   
He and his family were starved but the offerings for Siva continued.   
On the 8th day, while going to the temple, he swooned and the white   
rice fell on the floor. Suddenly a hand appeared from the ground   
and Siva took the white rice that had fallen on the ground and further,  
Nayanar heard the sound kadak, kadak, kadak.... the sounds of biting the raw  
baby mangoes pickles! Siva enjoyed the food and joyfully bit the baby mango  
pickels.   
4\. Kannappa offered roasted meat, jungle flowers and the waters   
carried in his mouth. Then the injury to Siva's eyes, and bleeding   
were noted. You know the rest of the story.   
Ramalinga Swamigal sings: I am not able to cut my son and offer you as food. (Siruthondar)   
I am not able to forgo my adulthood, and refrain from sleeping   
with my wife, as she doubted my fidelity and swore on you.   
(Tiru Neelakanta Nakka Nayanar).   
I am not able to reach your golden feet in SIX DAYS by offering   
my eyes, (Kannappa)   
What for am I living ? O Siva, please tell me what should this   
wastrel do in this life?   
Arunachala Siva.

Listening to the stories of Alwars and Nayanmars, I feel that we often have  
very limited understanding about God.

One Azhwar prayed to Tirupati Venkateswara: Let me born as   
a fruit in the fruit garden of Yours. He was not satisfied. He then   
said: Let me born a flower in Your flower gardens. Flowers also   
would wither away in one day. What to do? He then said: O   
Venkata, let me born as the step at your inner sanctorum, so that   
I shall be seeing your peal-like lips for ever. And the great devotees would  
step on me and go in and that will be a punya for me!   
One Nayanar, in the absence of money, placed water on the earthern   
lamps and used his long hairs at wick. And the lamp burned!   
Devotion at the extreme stage is a madness, and a madness of   
right type!   
Arunachala Siva.
