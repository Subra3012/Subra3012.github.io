The Verse 86 of Sivananda Lahari is another beautiful pageant.   
Puja dravya smrudayo virachita pujam katham kurmahe   
 Pakshitvam na cha va kididva mapi na praptham maya dhurlabam   
Jane masthaka-mangri pallava mumajane na deham vibho,   
Na jnatham hi pitamahena harina thadvena thadrupinaa   
O Umpathi! One who pervades everything and everywhere. The   
puja requirements are ready in heaps. But how can I do the puja?   
I am not able to fly like a swan. Nor do I have the form of a boar.   
Nor can I ever become a swan or a boar. How can I reach your   
head with matted locks and crescent moon? How can I find your   
feet like creeper? Even Brahma and Vishnu, who were capable of   
such trans-formations could not reach your head and feet.   
This is the story of Arunachala. Sri Sankara never visited Arunachala   
as per Sankara Vijayam stories. But he must have definitely known   
Arunachala purana stories and must have appreciated the esoteric   
significance of Brahma (Intellect,buddhi) and Vishnu (Ego, ahankara).   
Hence he has brought this in a few verses of Sivananda Lahari.   
Saint Manikkavachagar sings in Tiruvachakam: O with the flower-like feet that stretches lower than the seven   
nether worlds and even my words cannot comprehend;   
O with konrai flowers on the head, that is the finality of all that   
 can be comprehended or conceived.   
 \- Tiruvembavai   
Arunachala Siva.

## Pageants in Sivananda Lahari - 1  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 03, 2010, 08:52:06 AM

I thought I should write something from Sivananda Lahari of Sri   
Sankara, in commemoration of Siva-Nataraja for Ardra Darsanam,   
that was celebrated in the Asramam on 1st January 2010. Nataraja   
is the most pictureous Siva image amongst the eight images of Siva.   
There are several interesting pageants in Sri Sivananda Lahari.   
The Verse 85 speaks about Siva's curious food, dress and adornment.   
Jaladhimathana dhaksho daiva patala-bhedhi   
 Na cha vana-mrugayayam naiva lupta praveena   
Achana kusuma bhusha vastra mukyam saparyam   
 Kathaya kathamaham the kalpayaneendhu moule   
O Lord, with crescent moon on the locks! Your food is   
poison, the dresses are the tiger's skin and elephant's skin.   
I am not capable of churning the ocean. I am not capable of   
breaking the netherworlds. I am neither having felicity to   
hunt wild animals. Nor a clever hunter, am I. How can I do   
pujas to you with suitable food, flowers, ornaments, and attire?   
Please tell me.   
The essentials for puja to gods are attire, ornaments, flowers,   
and food i.e. Naivedya. For Siva, clothes are tiger's and elephant's skin;  
the best serpents can be obtained only from nether worlds.   
The flower is moon that has to be procured by churning milky   
ocean. The food or Naivedya is poison, which again can be had   
only by churning the milky ocean. Sri Sankara is nonplussed   
saying how can he bring these items to Siva puja.   
Siva is a madcap. His dress and oranments and food are making   
him appear as a madcap. Saint Manikkavachagar sings: "I shall laugh at you, if you do not take me out of this trecherous   
body-consciousness. I shall call you a madcap who has skinned   
the tiger and elephant, takes poison and that one who lives in   
cremation grounds. You are the madcap ruling over this madcap   
with body-consciousness."   
I bow to You, the Lord of Hall of Consciousness,   
With a curved foot, O Chidambareswara! - says   
Kunchitanghristavam, a poem of hundred songs on the curved   
foot of Siva, by AruL Nandi Sivam.   
My wife on that early morning of 1st January 2010, offered her   
eyetex to make a mark on Siva's cheek and Sivakamasundari's   
cheek, so that evil eyes would not fall on her, from observers who are jealous  
of their beauty. The priest took the eyetex and made   
some marks to avoid evil eyes. I was telling my wife: " For Sivakama   
Sundari, she is beautiful, it is okay to fix a mark on her cheek.   
Why such a mark for Nataraja, with all these madcap make-up?"   
My wife said: "You do not know, unless handsome, how this   
Sri Vaisnava girl can love and marry this Advaita brahmin?   
Siva is an Advaiti, he is Siva-Consciousness personified. But   
Sivakama Sundari, is the sister of Narayana, therefore a Sri   
Vaishnavaite and from cowherd's caste. This is the first inter-caste marriage  
of the human civilization!"   
I am wondering how my wife could interpret in such a curious way,   
the marriage of Sivakamasundari and Siva Nataraja.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Pageants in Sivananda Lahari - 3  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 03, 2010, 10:04:45 AM

In the Verse 87 of Sivanananda Lahari, Sri Sankara uses the same   
items viz., clothes, food, and ornaments in a different pageant.   
This verse is also quite beautiful in treating the subject.   
Ashanam garlam panee kalapo   
Vasanam charma cha vaahanam mahoskha   
mama dhasyasi kim kimasthi sambho   
tava padambuja bhakti meva dehi   
O Sambu! Your food is poison. Your ornament is serpents.   
Your dress is animals' skins. Your vehicle is the big Bull.   
What have you got to give me? What great things have you   
got? Please give me only the total devotion to your lotus feet!   
Muruganar says in Padamalai: Your Paadam is Padam. Your   
feet are the Source into which my mind should become quiescent.   
Kalidasa says in Kumara sambhavam: O Pinkapani!* You have   
nothing but you can give all the treasures that one wants. You   
are the Lord of the three worlds, but choose to live in snow capped   
mountains of Himachal. You are the embodiment of all welfare.   
But none can fathom your true state of Consciouness.   
Saint Manikkavachagar uses a different thematic picture: O Sankara! You have given You to me.   
And have taken this poor me to You.   
Who is wiser among the two?   
I got limitless bliss from you,   
What have you got from me?   
O the One who resides in my Heart as your temple,   
O Lord of Tiruperundurai!   
You have taken my body as Your Abode   
What recompense can I pay?   
 \- Kovil Tirupadigam, Decad on Koil (Chidambaram)   
(* Pinakam means in Sanskrit, both serpent and the Mount Meru.   
Siva holds the serpent as the arc of the bow and the Mount Meru   
as the bow and Narayana as the arrow for destroying Tripura.   
But none of these were used. He simply smiled at Tripura and   
it got burnt. Tripura, the three cities, mean mind, intellect and   
ego or mind, body and the worlds.)   
Arunachala Siva.

## Playing all alone  
Author: silentgreen         Date: January 03, 2010, 11:35:30 AM  
---  
During childhood I often played games all alone.   
The easiest to play was the carrom board. Taking one color's side like white,  
each strike will scatter the board sufficiently so that when I went to the  
other side of the board to play for the other color coin, there is always a  
new setting.   
It was more difficult to play cards alone since it involves part luck and part  
tactics.   
So I chose those games which has more luck and less tactics.   
The most difficult was to play chess all alone. Whatever tactics I thought for  
white gets carried over with me when I went to the other side of the board to  
play for black. So naturally I was in a position to get a prick in conscience  
for partiality. The only thing I thought was to decide separate game  
strategies beforehand for white and black and stick to the strategies  
throughout the games. This makes the game play a play between strategies  
taking away my botheration about partiality.   
Then I read that a single God is playing the whole world game all alone  
through so may jivas.   
This made me wonder whether God is playing it like carrom board, card or  
chess.

Dear silentgreen,   
Nice post. One Western philosopher has said: God is playing dice   
for us! In fact, I have also played chess all by myself. I shall   
of course, try to work out strategies for both black and white, when-   
ever I shift to the particular side. It is no doubt difficult. I became   
the Chess Champion of the college for one year, and was given the   
book The Chess Mind - by Gerald Abrams.   
Very famous world chess players like Alekhine and Bobby Fisher   
were mad caps. Madness or religion has something to do with the   
chess. I left chess during my late 20s.   
Arunachala Siva.

One another game that I used to play in my college hostel days,   
(whenever I am bored with reading a text book), was to pick a   
page and see how many letters from a to z are there in that page.   
I found after some months, that k, x and z are the most rare letters   
on any page.

Dear Subramanian.R,   
Nice observation. I thought that the letter "q" would be among the less  
occurring letters.   
Incidentally the thought came to me that chess board and pieces has some  
resemblance to Indian temples if arranged in this way: \- The four elephants with their lamp-like shapes to form four corner towers  
of the temples.   
\- The row of pawns to be serially arranged to form the boundary of the  
temple.   
\- The queens with their crowns looks like deities and can be placed at the  
middle of the board.   
\- The kings if put on top of boats and made taller can act as the temple  
"shikha", the middle tower of the temple.   
Now the question is where to put the horses?...with their heads slightly bent,  
they look like devotees.   
So they can be made to travel inside the temple compound.   
Now the black and white pieces need to cooperate instead of compete.   
The white pieces can form that side of the temple where sun rays are falling  
and blacks the shadowy side.   
The self of the devotee building the temple can act as the sun.   
In Periya Puranam a Nayanmar builds an entire Shiva temple in his mind.   
Then why can't the chess board also be used to build a temple?

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent imagery. The horses could also be various Vahanas (vehicles) of  
God.   
In Periya Puranam, different devotees have prayed to Siva in   
various fashions.   
1\. Poosalar Nayanar built the temple in his mind. Siva told the   
king that He would attend the consecration of Pusalar's temple   
first, and then come to his temple, which was built of finest   
stones and marbles.   
2. Sakkiya Nayanar threw stones at a Siva Linga, because he had   
already joined Jainism and the monks prevented him from doing   
pujas with flowers. Siva accepted his stones as flowers of gold.   
3\. Arivattya Nayanar offered to give Siva, the first received white   
rice and then whatever red rice (hand pound) that he had received   
as alms, took for his family food. Once, for a week or so, no red   
rice was forthcoming and all alms were only by way of white rice.   
He and his family were starved but the offerings for Siva continued.   
On the 8th day, while going to the temple, he swooned and the white   
rice fell on the floor. Suddenly a hand appeared from the ground   
and Siva took the white rice that had fallen on the ground and further,  
Nayanar heard the sound kadak, kadak, kadak.... the sounds of biting the raw  
baby mangoes pickles! Siva enjoyed the food and joyfully bit the baby mango  
pickels.   
4\. Kannappa offered roasted meat, jungle flowers and the waters   
carried in his mouth. Then the injury to Siva's eyes, and bleeding   
were noted. You know the rest of the story.   
Ramalinga Swamigal sings: I am not able to cut my son and offer you as food. (Siruthondar)   
I am not able to forgo my adulthood, and refrain from sleeping   
with my wife, as she doubted my fidelity and swore on you.   
(Tiru Neelakanta Nakka Nayanar).   
I am not able to reach your golden feet in SIX DAYS by offering   
my eyes, (Kannappa)   
What for am I living ? O Siva, please tell me what should this   
wastrel do in this life?   
Arunachala Siva.

Listening to the stories of Alwars and Nayanmars, I feel that we often have  
very limited understanding about God.

One Azhwar prayed to Tirupati Venkateswara: Let me born as   
a fruit in the fruit garden of Yours. He was not satisfied. He then   
said: Let me born a flower in Your flower gardens. Flowers also   
would wither away in one day. What to do? He then said: O   
Venkata, let me born as the step at your inner sanctorum, so that   
I shall be seeing your peal-like lips for ever. And the great devotees would  
step on me and go in and that will be a punya for me!   
One Nayanar, in the absence of money, placed water on the earthern   
lamps and used his long hairs at wick. And the lamp burned!   
Devotion at the extreme stage is a madness, and a madness of   
right type!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent imagery. The horses could also be various Vahanas (vehicles) of  
God.   
In Periya Puranam, different devotees have prayed to Siva in   
various fashions.   
1\. Poosalar Nayanar built the temple in his mind. Siva told the   
king that He would attend the consecration of Pusalar's temple   
first, and then come to his temple, which was built of finest   
stones and marbles.   
2. Sakkiya Nayanar threw stones at a Siva Linga, because he had   
already joined Jainism and the monks prevented him from doing   
pujas with flowers. Siva accepted his stones as flowers of gold.   
3\. Arivattya Nayanar offered to give Siva, the first received white   
rice and then whatever red rice (hand pound) that he had received   
as alms, took for his family food. Once, for a week or so, no red   
rice was forthcoming and all alms were only by way of white rice.   
He and his family were starved but the offerings for Siva continued.   
On the 8th day, while going to the temple, he swooned and the white   
rice fell on the floor. Suddenly a hand appeared from the ground   
and Siva took the white rice that had fallen on the ground and further,  
Nayanar heard the sound kadak, kadak, kadak.... the sounds of biting the raw  
baby mangoes pickles! Siva enjoyed the food and joyfully bit the baby mango  
pickels.   
4\. Kannappa offered roasted meat, jungle flowers and the waters   
carried in his mouth. Then the injury to Siva's eyes, and bleeding   
were noted. You know the rest of the story.   
Ramalinga Swamigal sings: I am not able to cut my son and offer you as food. (Siruthondar)   
I am not able to forgo my adulthood, and refrain from sleeping   
with my wife, as she doubted my fidelity and swore on you.   
(Tiru Neelakanta Nakka Nayanar).   
I am not able to reach your golden feet in SIX DAYS by offering

During childhood I often played games all alone.   
The easiest to play was the carrom board. Taking one color's side like white,  
each strike will scatter the board sufficiently so that when I went to the  
other side of the board to play for the other color coin, there is always a  
new setting.   
It was more difficult to play cards alone since it involves part luck and part  
tactics.   
So I chose those games which has more luck and less tactics.   
The most difficult was to play chess all alone. Whatever tactics I thought for  
white gets carried over with me when I went to the other side of the board to  
play for black. So naturally I was in a position to get a prick in conscience  
for partiality. The only thing I thought was to decide separate game  
strategies beforehand for white and black and stick to the strategies  
throughout the games. This makes the game play a play between strategies  
taking away my botheration about partiality.   
Then I read that a single God is playing the whole world game all alone

This made me wonder whether God is playing it like carrom board, card or

Dear silentgreen,   
Nice post. One Western philosopher has said: God is playing dice   
for us! In fact, I have also played chess all by myself. I shall   
of course, try to work out strategies for both black and white, when-   
ever I shift to the particular side. It is no doubt difficult. I became   
the Chess Champion of the college for one year, and was given the   
book The Chess Mind - by Gerald Abrams.   
Very famous world chess players like Alekhine and Bobby Fisher   
were mad caps. Madness or religion has something to do with the   
chess. I left chess during my late 20s.   
Arunachala Siva.

One another game that I used to play in my college hostel days,   
(whenever I am bored with reading a text book), was to pick a   
page and see how many letters from a to z are there in that page.   
I found after some months, that k, x and z are the most rare letters   
on any page.

Dear Subramanian.R,   
Nice observation. I thought that the letter "q" would be among the less  
occurring letters.   
Incidentally the thought came to me that chess board and pieces has some  
resemblance to Indian temples if arranged in this way: \- The four elephants with their lamp-like shapes to form four corner towers  
of the temples.   
\- The row of pawns to be serially arranged to form the boundary of the  
temple.   
\- The queens with their crowns looks like deities and can be placed at the  
middle of the board.   
\- The kings if put on top of boats and made taller can act as the temple  
"shikha", the middle tower of the temple.   
Now the question is where to put the horses?...with their heads slightly bent,  
they look like devotees.   
So they can be made to travel inside the temple compound.   
Now the black and white pieces need to cooperate instead of compete.   
The white pieces can form that side of the temple where sun rays are falling  
and blacks the shadowy side.   
The self of the devotee building the temple can act as the sun.   
In Periya Puranam a Nayanmar builds an entire Shiva temple in his mind.   
Then why can't the chess board also be used to build a temple?

Dear silentgreen,   
Nice post. One Western philosopher has said: God is playing dice   
for us! In fact, I have also played chess all by myself. I shall   
of course, try to work out strategies for both black and white, when-   
ever I shift to the particular side. It is no doubt difficult. I became   
the Chess Champion of the college for one year, and was given the   
book The Chess Mind - by Gerald Abrams.   
Very famous world chess players like Alekhine and Bobby Fisher   
were mad caps. Madness or religion has something to do with the   
chess. I left chess during my late 20s.   
Arunachala Siva.

One another game that I used to play in my college hostel days,   
(whenever I am bored with reading a text book), was to pick a   
page and see how many letters from a to z are there in that page.   
I found after some months, that k, x and z are the most rare letters

Dear Subramanian.R,   
Nice observation. I thought that the letter "q" would be among the less  
occurring letters.   
Incidentally the thought came to me that chess board and pieces has some  
resemblance to Indian temples if arranged in this way: \- The four elephants with their lamp-like shapes to form four corner towers  
of the temples.   
\- The row of pawns to be serially arranged to form the boundary of the  
temple.   
\- The queens with their crowns looks like deities and can be placed at the  
middle of the board.   
\- The kings if put on top of boats and made taller can act as the temple  
"shikha", the middle tower of the temple.   
Now the question is where to put the horses?...with their heads slightly bent,  
they look like devotees.   
So they can be made to travel inside the temple compound.   
Now the black and white pieces need to cooperate instead of compete.   
The white pieces can form that side of the temple where sun rays are falling  
and blacks the shadowy side.   
The self of the devotee building the temple can act as the sun.   
In Periya Puranam a Nayanmar builds an entire Shiva temple in his mind.

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent imagery. The horses could also be various Vahanas (vehicles) of  
God.   
In Periya Puranam, different devotees have prayed to Siva in   
various fashions.   
1\. Poosalar Nayanar built the temple in his mind. Siva told the   
king that He would attend the consecration of Pusalar's temple   
first, and then come to his temple, which was built of finest   
stones and marbles.   
2. Sakkiya Nayanar threw stones at a Siva Linga, because he had   
already joined Jainism and the monks prevented him from doing   
pujas with flowers. Siva accepted his stones as flowers of gold.   
3\. Arivattya Nayanar offered to give Siva, the first received white   
rice and then whatever red rice (hand pound) that he had received   
as alms, took for his family food. Once, for a week or so, no red   
rice was forthcoming and all alms were only by way of white rice.   
He and his family were starved but the offerings for Siva continued.   
On the 8th day, while going to the temple, he swooned and the white   
rice fell on the floor. Suddenly a hand appeared from the ground   
and Siva took the white rice that had fallen on the ground and further,  
Nayanar heard the sound kadak, kadak, kadak.... the sounds of biting the raw  
baby mangoes pickles! Siva enjoyed the food and joyfully bit the baby mango  
pickels.   
4\. Kannappa offered roasted meat, jungle flowers and the waters   
carried in his mouth. Then the injury to Siva's eyes, and bleeding   
were noted. You know the rest of the story.   
Ramalinga Swamigal sings: I am not able to cut my son and offer you as food. (Siruthondar)   
I am not able to forgo my adulthood, and refrain from sleeping   
with my wife, as she doubted my fidelity and swore on you.   
(Tiru Neelakanta Nakka Nayanar).   
I am not able to reach your golden feet in SIX DAYS by offering

During childhood I often played games all alone.   
The easiest to play was the carrom board. Taking one color's side like white,  
each strike will scatter the board sufficiently so that when I went to the  
other side of the board to play for the other color coin, there is always a  
new setting.   
It was more difficult to play cards alone since it involves part luck and part  
tactics.   
So I chose those games which has more luck and less tactics.   
The most difficult was to play chess all alone. Whatever tactics I thought for  
white gets carried over with me when I went to the other side of the board to  
play for black. So naturally I was in a position to get a prick in conscience  
for partiality. The only thing I thought was to decide separate game  
strategies beforehand for white and black and stick to the strategies  
throughout the games. This makes the game play a play between strategies  
taking away my botheration about partiality.   
Then I read that a single God is playing the whole world game all alone  
through so may jivas.   
This made me wonder whether God is playing it like carrom board, card or  
chess.

Listening to the stories of Alwars and Nayanmars, I feel that we often have  
very limited understanding about God.

One Azhwar prayed to Tirupati Venkateswara: Let me born as   
a fruit in the fruit garden of Yours. He was not satisfied. He then   
said: Let me born a flower in Your flower gardens. Flowers also   
would wither away in one day. What to do? He then said: O   
Venkata, let me born as the step at your inner sanctorum, so that   
I shall be seeing your peal-like lips for ever. And the great devotees would  
step on me and go in and that will be a punya for me!   
One Nayanar, in the absence of money, placed water on the earthern   
lamps and used his long hairs at wick. And the lamp burned!   
Devotion at the extreme stage is a madness, and a madness of   
right type!

## Playing all alone  
Author: silentgreen         Date: January 03, 2010, 03:05:30 PM

During childhood I often played games all alone.   
The easiest to play was the carrom board. Taking one color's side like white,  
each strike will scatter the board sufficiently so that when I went to the  
other side of the board to play for the other color coin, there is always a  
new setting.   
It was more difficult to play cards alone since it involves part luck and part  
tactics.   
So I chose those games which has more luck and less tactics.   
The most difficult was to play chess all alone. Whatever tactics I thought for  
white gets carried over with me when I went to the other side of the board to  
play for black. So naturally I was in a position to get a prick in conscience  
for partiality. The only thing I thought was to decide separate game  
strategies beforehand for white and black and stick to the strategies  
throughout the games. This makes the game play a play between strategies  
taking away my botheration about partiality.   
Then I read that a single God is playing the whole world game all alone  
through so may jivas.   
This made me wonder whether God is playing it like carrom board, card or  
chess.

Dear silentgreen,   
Nice post. One Western philosopher has said: God is playing dice   
for us! In fact, I have also played chess all by myself. I shall   
of course, try to work out strategies for both black and white, when-   
ever I shift to the particular side. It is no doubt difficult. I became   
the Chess Champion of the college for one year, and was given the   
book The Chess Mind - by Gerald Abrams.   
Very famous world chess players like Alekhine and Bobby Fisher   
were mad caps. Madness or religion has something to do with the   
chess. I left chess during my late 20s.   
Arunachala Siva.

One another game that I used to play in my college hostel days,   
(whenever I am bored with reading a text book), was to pick a   
page and see how many letters from a to z are there in that page.   
I found after some months, that k, x and z are the most rare letters   
on any page.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian.R,   
Nice observation. I thought that the letter "q" would be among the less  
occurring letters.   
Incidentally the thought came to me that chess board and pieces has some  
resemblance to Indian temples if arranged in this way: \- The four elephants with their lamp-like shapes to form four corner towers  
of the temples.   
\- The row of pawns to be serially arranged to form the boundary of the  
temple.   
\- The queens with their crowns looks like deities and can be placed at the  
middle of the board.   
\- The kings if put on top of boats and made taller can act as the temple  
"shikha", the middle tower of the temple.   
Now the question is where to put the horses?...with their heads slightly bent,  
they look like devotees.   
So they can be made to travel inside the temple compound.   
Now the black and white pieces need to cooperate instead of compete.   
The white pieces can form that side of the temple where sun rays are falling  
and blacks the shadowy side.   
The self of the devotee building the temple can act as the sun.   
In Periya Puranam a Nayanmar builds an entire Shiva temple in his mind.   
Then why can't the chess board also be used to build a temple?

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent imagery. The horses could also be various Vahanas (vehicles) of  
God.   
In Periya Puranam, different devotees have prayed to Siva in   
various fashions.   
1\. Poosalar Nayanar built the temple in his mind. Siva told the   
king that He would attend the consecration of Pusalar's temple   
first, and then come to his temple, which was built of finest   
stones and marbles.   
2. Sakkiya Nayanar threw stones at a Siva Linga, because he had   
already joined Jainism and the monks prevented him from doing   
pujas with flowers. Siva accepted his stones as flowers of gold.   
3\. Arivattya Nayanar offered to give Siva, the first received white   
rice and then whatever red rice (hand pound) that he had received   
as alms, took for his family food. Once, for a week or so, no red   
rice was forthcoming and all alms were only by way of white rice.   
He and his family were starved but the offerings for Siva continued.   
On the 8th day, while going to the temple, he swooned and the white   
rice fell on the floor. Suddenly a hand appeared from the ground   
and Siva took the white rice that had fallen on the ground and further,  
Nayanar heard the sound kadak, kadak, kadak.... the sounds of biting the raw  
baby mangoes pickles! Siva enjoyed the food and joyfully bit the baby mango  
pickels.   
4\. Kannappa offered roasted meat, jungle flowers and the waters   
carried in his mouth. Then the injury to Siva's eyes, and bleeding   
were noted. You know the rest of the story.   
Ramalinga Swamigal sings: I am not able to cut my son and offer you as food. (Siruthondar)   
I am not able to forgo my adulthood, and refrain from sleeping   
with my wife, as she doubted my fidelity and swore on you.   
(Tiru Neelakanta Nakka Nayanar).   
I am not able to reach your golden feet in SIX DAYS by offering   
my eyes, (Kannappa)   
What for am I living ? O Siva, please tell me what should this   
wastrel do in this life?   
Arunachala Siva.
