In the Yoga Sutra, meditation involves the whole of a process comprising  
dharana, dhyana and samadhi.   
This can be expressed in terms of the traditional imagery cited by Sankara: first a lamp is firmly grasped,   
then filled with oil and lit, whereupon the light alone is seen to be shining  
forth. Collectively, these three   
aspects, known as samyama, are regarded as the direct means (antaranga) to the  
goal of yoga. (See Yoga   
Sutra 3.4.ff). The five preceding steps are only indirect aids (bahiranga),  
which prepare the ground for   
Samyama. (Samyama means self control).   
The Yoga Sutra distinguishes between two types of meditation. Strictly  
speaking these are Samadhi-s.   
But 'meditation' is used here in the broader sense of the term which comprises  
dhyana and samadhi.   
The two are inseparably linked as components of Samyama.
