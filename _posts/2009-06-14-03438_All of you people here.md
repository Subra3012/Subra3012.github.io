## Palakottu, Guru Murtham and Isanya Math  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 13, 2009, 03:35:57 PM  
---  
Dear karthikeyan. M,   
Palakottu \- Just behind Mother's Temple. There is a small   
gate to enter the bushy forest area. After about 100 metres,   
you can see some cottages. This is where Annamalai Swami,   
Chadwick and other great men stayed. There is a Samadhi   
for Annamalai Swami.   
Guru Murtham - This is in Vetta Valam Road, about 3kms   
from Asramam inside the town. There is a Samadhi for   
Guru Jnana Desikar, with a Siva Lingam. Here Bhagavan   
and a few others stayed for 6 months, when there was   
no water in Virupakshi Cave area. There is a small temple,   
which is often closed. You have to check up with nearby   
houses. In one of the houses, there is a key, they will   
come and open the shrine. You can take some camphor   
and light it there. You may pay some amount for the house   
people since they invariably buy oil for the lamp.   
Isanya Math - This is on Giri Valam, main road. Towards   
the end, you have to take a deviation for about 200 mts.   
and you can see Isanya Desikar Math, which is managed   
by Kovilur Math. The trust member stays in the adjacent   
house, where there is a Veda Patasala. Here is where   
Isanya Jnana Desikar attained Samadhi. Bhagavan Ramana   
went for lunch one day, on the compulsion of the then Kovilur   
Math Head, who took him in a bullock cart, literally lifting   
Bhagavan up! Bhagavan Ramana went there, had a lunch   
and gave a small extempore discourse to students on Bhagavad Gita. He was  
hardly 25 at that time.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Krishna is black  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 14, 2009, 02:13:54 PM  
---  
There is a Marathi song, which reads as follows: Krishna asked his mother Yasoda: "Amma, why I am black   
and Radha is red?'   
Yasoda answered: "O my child, Radha was born during   
daytime but you were born in midnight, so you are black."   
Krishana pursued: "Amma, but the calf at our house was   
born at midnight, but it is spotlessly white. How come?"   
Yasoda said: " But its mother is black, don't you see? There   
will be some exceptions."   
Krishna did not leave the matter: "How come the cow eats   
green grass but gives white milk. I eat white butter but   
I am still black!"   
Yasoda has no answer. The Child is father of the man!   
[Krishna or Narayana and Uma are black or euphemistically   
green in colour. One Azhwar sings: O the Black Ruby! Uma   
is also called Syamala, meaning green. They are siblings.   
Siva and Saraswati are siblings. They are milky white in   
complexion. Brahma and Lakshmi (Radha) are red in   
complexion.]   
Arunachala Siva.

## Siva Manasa Puja of a different kind - 7  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 14, 2009, 03:37:28 PM  
---  
Mangayarkarasi was the Pandyan King. She was born to   
a Chozha but was given in marriage to Pandyan Nedu Maran.   
Nedu Maran was only a name sake Nedu Maran, Tall Narayana,   
but he was a hunchback. He got somehow attracted to Jainism   
and Jain monks ruled over him. All pujas in Meenakshi Temple   
in Madurai and other temples were stopped. Even though the   
Queen was a pious Saivite, she could not even apply holy ashes   
on her forehead and she is said to have mixed holy ashes in   
the sandal paste and applied it on her breasts. The King's   
minister was an ardent Saivite and the King could not help   
it, because he needed Kulachirayar, the minister. The minister   
wanted to call Jnana Sambandhar to the city so that he would   
do something with the king and the Jainism. He told the queen   
to permit him to send someone to Vedaranyam to see Jnana   
Sambandhar and bring him to Madurai. As soon as the queen   
heard Jnana Sambandar's name [the saint was eight years   
old then![, her breasts oozed mother's milk. Such was her   
motherly love for the child whom she had not seen even once!   
The story goes that Jnana Sambandhar came to Madurai and   
meantime, the king developed acute colic pain and the mantras   
and peacock-feather touching of Jainism only increased the   
colic pain. He agreed to call Jnana Sambandha. The queen   
and the minister rushed to the temple and Jnana Sambandha   
was there and they respectfully invited him to the palace to   
cure the king's colic pain. Jnana Sambandha said that he   
would first see Sundareswara and Meenakshi and then come.   
The queen and the minsiter were waiting in the outer portals   
of the temple. Jnana Sambandha sang: O Siva, I have come   
with your approval and to pay heed to my mother's request.   
Please make my trip success. The queen was thrilled. Jnana   
Sambandha came and with holy ashes, he cured the king's   
colic pain and also straightened his back. As per the challenge, the Jain  
monks volunteered to go to the gallows.   
Sekkizhar says that while Bhagavati was Jnana Sambandhar's   
biological mother and Uma was his spiritual mother, [Uma came with Siva and  
gave breast milk at Seerkazhi when the saint   
was three years old], Mangayarkarasi was the saint's mother   
in all equality with Bhagavati and Uma. The queen considered   
him as his child and after wedding to Pandyan King, that is   
the only Siva Puja she did.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear tradere,   
Suppose i see a flower, a rose, say. The flower is beautiful. So when i see  
you, as a friend, i want to share the beauty of the flower with you. But you  
do not know the flower. So how do i introduce you to the flower ?   
I will have to show you the flower. .. Right? That is the only way that it is  
possible.   
Now, the "second hand quotes" are like telling "Rose is beautiful". . If you  
have not seen it, its a waste! coz whether or not the rose is beautiful. .. u  
cannot appreciate it! After some time you find it really disgusting, coz i am  
repeating the same thing and it makes no sense!   
Ok, so then, we agree we need to share the vision... i say, ok, come with me  
ill show you the rose. .. and i take you... as i walk... suddenly you turn  
away... surprised, i question you! and you say "Sir, this cannot be the way to  
roses!". Why? Coz in my school so and so person said this. ... now that is  
the first problem. you need to agree to allow me to show.   
So if these criteria are satisfied we can journey into it! and we can share a  
vision.   
Love!   
Silence

Great analogy. Except, you have not seen the flower. You have heard the  
words of someone who has seen the flower. Rather than do whatever is  
necessary to see the flower, you talk about seeing flowers. Thus the obvious  
hypocrisy. I'm a hypocrite too, but I see it. Why don't you?

Dear tradere,   
How do u say that?   
**" Rather than do whatever is necessary to see the flower, you talk about  
seeing flowers"**   
And when i offered to show the flower to you. ..   
why did you not follow this advice of yours?   
Please see. .. if you think a realized person cannot be writing in here or  
that a realized person should be in himalayas or some such place. .. eating  
nothing etc. ..   
if you have some such ideas, its was totally futile to write here. u should  
have gone to the jungles or himalayas and sought.   
now suppose you thought there could be someone here. .. may be you have met  
one ! or may be not...   
We can brand ourselves. .. we can label ourselves as hypocrites, intelligent  
people, real fools etc later. .. lets first get to the matter and try to share  
the vision. .. what do u say ?   
Love!

Dear tradere,   
Seeing a flower, not seeing a flower, seeing a flower through   
someone else or the Guru: "Who is this man? Is it not our   
ego, to find these words and elaborate on these?"   
Once Bhagavan Ramana was sitting on the Hall. Devaraja Mudaliar   
asked Him: "Bhagavan! You are telling Grace is ever flowing. How   
is that I am not able to receive the Grace? Is it not flowing to me?"   
Bhagavan Ramana smiled and then said in Tamil: "Oye! Who is   
coming in between you and the guru's grace? You please keep away   
and the Grace will flow to you!" The first "you" is the ego of the   
devotee and the second "you" is the individual devotee. For all of us, mind  
jumps out earlier than the Heart!   
Arunachala Siva.

Infact many people went to Ramana himself but returned without Realization.  
Many people lived so close to Ramana and yet involved in politics etc.   
Ramana could have given any of them silent diksha [silently reveal the Self]  
... but they were not seeing. ..   
Ramana sat there silent and ever Blissful. .. and yet they were not looking at  
him.   
its like the story of two birds illustrated in the vedanta. .. Ramana was  
seated. .. people jumped from one fruit to another. .. everytime they found a  
fruit that is bitter, they looked at Ramana, went to him and stayed there for  
some time. .. and again they would move out to seek some fruit or the other  
fruit!   
Love!

Dear amiatall,   
All of us are Self Realized. What we have not been realizing   
is the fact that clouds of ignorance, Ajnana [anger, lust, hypocrisy,   
hate verbal duels to prove a point ec.,], are hiding the ever shining   
Self or the Brahman. The Forum may, perhaps, help a few serious   
seekers to have the clouds of ignorance removed. It is like removing   
the smoke by rubbing with a cloth of a glass cover of the chimney. Then the  
chimney is pure without hiding the Light within.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear amiatall,   
Yes. The chimney is full of, say one ton of smoke that it might   
take several births to complete the polishing work, since our   
polishing work is done through a small cloth which is also full   
of smoke!

Dear amiatall,   
Small cloth - I meant the mind/ego. It is small because it   
is almost nothing, as Bhagavan Ramana said on another occasion.   
The mind in insubstantial.   
Yes. The mind is the policman and the thief. The policman and   
the thief example was told by Bhagavan Ramana to highlight   
the fact, that the mind cannot comprehend the Self. Because   
the Self is beyond thinking, because ratiocination, beyond books,   
and it is comprehended by anubhava, or experience. The Self   
is Experience. All that are mental products, books, logic, thoughts   
are outside. After a deep sleep, one gets up in the morning   
and says: "I had a good sleep." No one says during the sleep that   
he slept well! All descriptions of the Self in the books are all   
thoughts. All the books are all the spitted saliva of the experiencer!   
Now how the mind can enquire the mind? There is no other go.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Sri Arunachala Ashatakam Verse 5: With the mind that is stone, the Ruby has to be discovered,   
by rubbing against the mind, another stone! The mind becomes   
the Self! The stone becomes the Ruby!   
The question of polisher and the polished comes with this   
mind grinding the mind. There is really only one. The mind, the polisher  
becomes the polished, the Ruby.   
Now we know the flame in the chimney. We know the cloth. Then what/where is  
the soot or smoke? The Self is blemishless, taintless. But the Self is  
covered by the vasanas [the latent tendencies of good and bad] coming through  
several births, which are mind products. Only this soot or the smoke has to  
be polished. For that one has to use   
the mind. Again mind rubbing the mind to find it as Ruby.   
Mani Kadainthu ena manam manam ennum kallil maru ara   
kadaiya nin arul oli mevum..... A. Ashtaakam., Verse 5.   
Arunachala Siva.
