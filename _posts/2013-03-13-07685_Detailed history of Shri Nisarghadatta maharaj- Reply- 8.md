Dear Vladimir,   
Great! I would love to see these pictures and clips. Also to read and know  
more about the places of all the Gurus from our lineage. I actually know very  
little,only basic things. And its very interesting to know all and see from  
someone who actually is been there,and recently too. And i am very interested  
to see and hear Sri Ramakant Maharaj.   
Yes,i think i will understand. Our languages are very similar,and i generally  
i know little Russian,from shooll.   
Thank You so much for the chance to participate in Your wonderful pilgrimage!   
With love and prayers,
