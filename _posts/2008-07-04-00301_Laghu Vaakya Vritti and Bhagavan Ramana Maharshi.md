Tamilians and Keralites who follow sun-based calendar celebrate   
their New Year called Souramana Yugadi or Tamil New Year or   
Vishu. Tomorrow, the 14th April, is the Tamil New Year or Vishu.   
I wish all the Kerala and Tamil Nadu members a happy and prosperous New Year  
and ever increasing Grace of Bhagavan Ramana.   
Arunachala Siva.

Today I read in Bangalore newspaper, that Mr. Vatal Nagaraj,   
the leader of one party called Kannada Chauluvalikar has announced   
that he will do 'pada poojas' for donkeys and then proceed for   
his campaigning. He has also assured that, if elected, he will   
work for estabishing a Donkey Development Authority and he   
will also declare a weekly holiday from work for donkeys. Any   
such declarations from any other States?   
Arunachala Siva.

## Prasna-Uttara Ratna Malika and Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 05, 2008, 08:03:17 AM  
---  
Prasna-Uttara Ratna Malika is again a small book, comprising of 67   
slokas. The verses are in the form of two simple questions and two   
simple answers, in each verse. The book details the do's and don'ts for the  
seeker and the ultimate realization.   
Verse 45 :- "What is the source of all happiness? The merits of one's   
good actions. What causes misery? One's sins. By what will one be   
endowed with Lordliness? By the devoted worship of Siva."   
Verse 53:- "What is the most difficult thing for a man to do? To keep   
the mind always under control."   
Verse 54:- "What is the most adorable being? The Power of Pure   
Consciousness.   
Verse 58:- "Who is the Lord of Maya? The Supreme Being. What is the   
greatest magic? The ever changing universe. What resembles a dream   
experience? The activities of the waking life! What is the true being?   
It is Brahman, the Supreme Being."   
Arunachala Siva.

## Atama Jnana Upadesa Vidhi and Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 06, 2008, 09:20:54 AM  
---  
Atma Jnana Upadesa Vidhi, is again a small treatise on Advaita by   
Sankara. It comprises of 72 axioms in prose form detailing the 'seer'   
'seen' concept mentioned by Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi in 'Who am I?'   
A sample.   
Axioms 4,5, and 6 of Part IV says: That the Self is the Fourth means that It  
consists of Consciousness only and nothing else, like a homogeneous piece of  
gold. Thought it is the Fourth, It is not different from the three well-known  
viz., waking, dream and sleep. We call It the Fourth, because It is the  
Witness of the other three states, as Consciousness in proximity. One has to  
invariably arrive at a void, if the Fourth were a different state, as in that  
case, the truth about the Self could not be known.   
Axiom 13 says: A man of knowledge directly knows within himself that he has  
attained the Self-Knowledge.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Laghu Vaakya Vritti and Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 04, 2008, 08:31:56 AM  
---  
Laghu Vaakya Vritti, as the name implies, is a condensation of   
Vaakya Vritti. While the bigger book has got 53 verses, this one   
comprises of only 18 verses. Of the two Maha Vakyas, Tat vam Asi   
and Aham Brahmasmi which have been explained in the bigger book,   
this book takes only Aham Brahmasmi and explains its purport. The book   
deals with an examination of our consciousness, in waking dream   
and deep sleep states. In our waking and dream states, the consciousness is  
always associated with an idea (buddhi vritti). As such, it appears to be   
objective and continuously changing. This is called Bodha Bhasa - a   
reflection of Pure Consciousness - Suddha Bodha. These two correspond to 'I'  
and 'the Self, Jiva-Brahman. A sample,   
Verse 6 says: "Water heated on fire acquires heat and so becomes capable of  
heating the body. In the like manner, the intellect illumined by Pure   
Consciousness acqires its lustre and thereby illumines all other external  
objects."   
Verse 10 says: " The thread covered by he pearls in a string can be seen  
between two pearls. Similarly, the Pure Consciousness also, though hidden by  
the modifications of the intellect, can be clearly perceived in between any  
two modifications."   
Verse 12 says: "Persons aspiring to the experience of Brahman should,   
therefore, practise by slow degrees this restraint of modifications starting  
with one moment and then extending to two, three and so on."   
Verse 18 says:- " Consummation of this practice lies in the firm conviction of  
one's identity with Brahman, like what conviction is normally there in the  
sense of identity of the self with the body. One, who has realized this is  
liberated, indeed without a doubt. His body may then drop off, any time, any  
where."   
Bhagavan's teachings are also focussed towards the elimination of the   
world, self and the god to merge in the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear non-duel, Thank you. The mudpot (or golden pot) simile   
is only to stress that we are all reflecting the Wisdom of our Guru,   
the Sun, Son of God, in our different capacities. On the day, when all these  
pots break away, there will only be 'AKASA', the all pervasive, limitless  
ether, the Brahman, our Guru.   
Arunachala Siva.
