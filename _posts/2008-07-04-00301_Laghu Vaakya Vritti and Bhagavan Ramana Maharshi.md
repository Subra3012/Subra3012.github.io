Laghu Vaakya Vritti, as the name implies, is a condensation of   
Vaakya Vritti. While the bigger book has got 53 verses, this one   
comprises of only 18 verses. Of the two Maha Vakyas, Tat vam Asi   
and Aham Brahmasmi which have been explained in the bigger book,   
this book takes only Aham Brahmasmi and explains its purport. The book   
deals with an examination of our consciousness, in waking dream   
and deep sleep states. In our waking and dream states, the consciousness is  
always associated with an idea (buddhi vritti). As such, it appears to be   
objective and continuously changing. This is called Bodha Bhasa - a   
reflection of Pure Consciousness - Suddha Bodha. These two correspond to 'I'  
and 'the Self, Jiva-Brahman. A sample,   
Verse 6 says: "Water heated on fire acquires heat and so becomes capable of  
heating the body. In the like manner, the intellect illumined by Pure   
Consciousness acqires its lustre and thereby illumines all other external  
objects."   
Verse 10 says: " The thread covered by he pearls in a string can be seen  
between two pearls. Similarly, the Pure Consciousness also, though hidden by  
the modifications of the intellect, can be clearly perceived in between any  
two modifications."   
Verse 12 says: "Persons aspiring to the experience of Brahman should,   
therefore, practise by slow degrees this restraint of modifications starting  
with one moment and then extending to two, three and so on."   
Verse 18 says:- " Consummation of this practice lies in the firm conviction of  
one's identity with Brahman, like what conviction is normally there in the  
sense of identity of the self with the body. One, who has realized this is  
liberated, indeed without a doubt. His body may then drop off, any time, any  
where."   
Bhagavan's teachings are also focussed towards the elimination of the   
world, self and the god to merge in the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear non-duel, Thank you. The mudpot (or golden pot) simile   
is only to stress that we are all reflecting the Wisdom of our Guru,   
the Sun, Son of God, in our different capacities. On the day, when all these  
pots break away, there will only be 'AKASA', the all pervasive, limitless  
ether, the Brahman, our Guru.   
Arunachala Siva.
