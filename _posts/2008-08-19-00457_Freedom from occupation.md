Dear DRPVSSN Raju, Yes, when the mind withdraws and curls   
up into the Self, there is no mental occupation and duty.

In deep sleep we already remain thus !   
The point is, remaining without thoughts is nothing special. Self Knowledge is  
needed. Once Self knowledge is there, a person is totally comfortable with  
thoughts as even without them. Coz the witness is not worried if the thoughts  
occur or do not occur.

Dear srkudai, I am only repeating what I have already said: Thoughtless state is Self Realization. If thoughts spring up,   
after Self is realized, these are the thoughts from Suddha Manas,   
Pure Mind and are harmless.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian ji,   
 Lets agree to disagree on this point.   
If Ramana had no thoughts how can he speak and respond. If Ramana's brain  
was scanned, we should have had some thought ripples.   
But Ramana Said he has no thoughts ? Yes sir, he even said he had no body !  
Since no body, no thoughts either.. how can a person have thoughts with out a  
body ?   
Love!   
Silence

Dear srkudai, Yes, Thoughts do spring up after realization. It   
is from Suddha manas, for helping others and posterity. Sankara   
wrote many books, composed wonderful verses like Soundarya   
Lahari and Sivananda Lahari. It the Self realized people could   
not have thoughts, then the disciples and future generations   
would not have any teachings, from them. The Suddha Manas   
operates in Sahaja Samadhi.   
Arunachala Siva.

There is difference between a sage and an ordinary person regarding  
thought.Sage uses thought only when it is required and thought is   
under his full control,where as ordinary person is unable to control the  
thought when it is not necessary and thought is diverting his attention   
from the self all the time.Ordinary person is in the grip of thought,where as  
sage is free from grip of thought.
