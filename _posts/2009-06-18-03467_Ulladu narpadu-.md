## Vittala devotees and Siva devotees  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 18, 2009, 02:06:37 PM

I heard from a discourse last evening: The devotees of Vittala are not Vaishnavites in a strict sense.   
In fact, they treat Vittala both as Vishnu and Siva. Some   
of these devotees' lives stand parallel to Siva devotees   
of Periya Puranam.   
Periya Puranam speaks of four bhavas of devotees.   
The first is Child-Father relationship, Pitru or Matru   
bhava. We have got Tiru Jnana Sambandhar who considerd   
himself as Siva-Uma's son. In fact, he is an avatara of Skanda.   
In Maha Bhakta Vijayam, Mukta Bai, the girl-child, younger   
sister of Jnana Deva, treated Vittala as her Father.   
The second is Sakya-bhava, or relationship of a friend.   
Sundaramoorthy treated Siva as his friend. He even asked   
Him to go to his wife's place as a messenger to solve the   
love-quarrel. In Maha Bhakta Vijayam, Nama Deva treated   
Vittala as his friend. He used to call Him in singular, as one   
calls his close friend.   
The third is Dasa Bhava. The relationship between a slave   
and a Master. Purandara Dasa is a classic example for this.   
Saint Tiru Navukkarasar treated him as a slave of Siva. He   
used to take a small pick axe and spade to clear the weeds   
in all Siva's temples.   
The fourth is Nayaki-Nayaka Bhava. Saint Manikkavachagar   
is the classic example in Siva saints, even though he does not   
find a place in the group of 63 Saints. Chaitanya Maha Prabhu   
is also an example for Nayaki-Nayaka Bhava. He treated   
Jagannath of Puri if not Vittala, as his husband. Manikkavachagar's Tiru  
Chitrambala Kovai, with 400 verses   
is full of this bhava. He even says certain things which would   
make Arabian Nights hang its head in shame. Later Chidambaram Ramalinga Swami  
said in one of his poems: The brahmins will find this [TCK] as Vedas,   
Tamil pandits as classic Tamil Veda.   
Yogis will call it as a terrific example of Veera Marga*   
And the normal seekers call it a good Kama Sastra!   
[* Veera Marga is one where the yogi treats God or Goddess   
as his bed-mate. Bhairavi Brahmani wanted to teach SRK   
this. SRK refused.]   
Arunachala Siva.
