Dear Anand Sundaram   
As I am a diabetic for the past 10 years, I take Metformine 850 mg 3 times and  
Amarel 2mg morning, daily. Often I take some herbal medicines like Chakkari  
Kolli and Vendhayam sprouts powder (fenugrec or methi)to reduce sugar level.   
I do no know about blood pressure. I told Mr krishnan to contact a good  
Diabetologist and follow his advice.

Dear Sri Krishna,dear Sri Anand,dear Sri Balaji Sir,   
Here are some natural recipes from Serbian Father Tadej. He is a Saint and  
Prophet. His recipes are truly helping and good,but it must be prepared the  
way it is said. Above all,they are very simple. I am only not sure can all  
those herbs be found in India. But here it is: _ High blood pressure   
Herbcapsella bursa pastoris,Eng - Shepards Purse,cut to small parts and  
left it to stay in the cold water for 6/9 hours. Not cooking it,just drinking  
that filtered water.   
*   
_**   
Shepards Purse   
_ Recipe no. 2   
Lemon's lieves (3 for one cup) put in boiled water,waiting just 2 bubbling  
,put it away from fire,after 15 min filter it,and drink it. Tea must be fresh  
made every time._**   
With love and prayers,

Diabetes   
In boiled water put 5-6 lieves of black morus,or morus nigra(for one  
cup),waiting just 2/3bubbling times and put it away from fire. Cover it and  
wait 15-20 minutes. Then drink it.**   
Black Morus   
 **High cholesterol   
Take one onion and clean it,leave it just with two layers. Cut in in shape of  
cross,put it in full large cup of water,and leave it to stay for 9 hours. Then  
drink that water and on top of same onion put fresh water. Leave it to stay  
again for 9 hours. Drink water on every 9 hours, 4-7 days. After every third  
drinking,tow away onion,and put fresh one.**

Just to add some rules in making and drinking tea.   
1\. Every glass of tea must be cooked fresh,just before drinking. Not  
preparing it infront for whole day.   
2\. Drink tea before meal.   
3\. Drinking tea slowly.   
4\. Not putting sugar in it. Only honey can be used,if someone must drink it  
sweet.   
Apart from that,avoid meat generaly,except fish. He highly recommendes fish.  
Instead of regular meat can be used,herb nettle. It has all our body needs.  
Also,lots of fruits and vegetables of all  
colors(orange,green,white,etc).Sure,some fruits,most of them,must be avoided  
by people with diabetes.   
With love and prayers,

Dear Lathaji,   
Thank You so much! I certainly have many questions regarding Indian  
cooking,that i dont know from where to start.   
Do You have some good recipe which involves preparing vegetables and rice  
together,like mix? Not even recipe,but i need some basic rules for dish like  
that. Which spices to put which are must,etc. I like improvising with food,but  
i dont know these basic rules,so to say,in Indian cusine.   
With love and prayers,

Dear Atma vichar,   
All these websites are lovely. Would you have something for fasting foods like  
for amavasya, mondays, shivaratri.... for those of us who are not able to do  
no food no water.   
Thanks
