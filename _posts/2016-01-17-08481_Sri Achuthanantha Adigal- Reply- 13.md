The next day before noon a Samadhi pit was dug in the same open place where  
same open place   
where Swamigal had stood and spoken to himself earlier in the morning.  
Swamigal had stood and spoken   
to himself earlier in the morning. Swamigal's body was given a Thirumanjanam  
bath, with water from   
holy Ganga which someone has brought by chance, it was decorated, worshipped,  
and was placed   
on pearl plank. To the accompaniment of auspicious music, surrounded by  
thousands of people,   
Swamigal's body was taken to the site of the samadhi pit and was placed in it  
at 5.00 p.m.   
All that had to be done was done properly and everyday prayer was also done  
according to traditions   
for a Jeevanmukta. Before the first anniversary function, many of the  
disciples were very eager to see   
Swamigal's gracious form. Some nine devotees opened the samadhi pit one day  
and saw the divine form.   
To their surprise Swamigal's body had not undergone any change and, not only  
that, there were sweat   
drops oozing out from the forehead. One of the disciples wiped off some sweat  
from the body and to the   
bafflement of everyone it kept oozing out! The action was repeated several  
times with the same effect.   
This extraordinary sight was witnessed by some twenty one blessed ones  
including the nine referred   
to above. Having performed the decoration and prayers for that day, the  
Samadhi pit was closed.

Arunachala Siva.
