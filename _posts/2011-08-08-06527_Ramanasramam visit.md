## Ramanasramam visit

Hello Friends,   
I am visiting Tiruvannamalai coming saturday/sunday for the first time.   
Saturday evening to Sunday noon, I am planning to spend time on ramanasramam.   
It will be a great help if you can give ideas like how best to spend time on  
the things in and around ashram.

Dear friend,   
If you are arriving in T'malai say by 6 am., then you can straightaway   
to Ramaneswara Mahalingam Temple [Samdahi Hall] and see the   
early morning brief puja and then take a little milk that is given as prasada.   
From there you can go to dining hall and have your coffee and breakfast.   
It will be over by 7.30 am. Thereafter you will be free to do any one or   
more of the following things: 1\. Visiting Arunachaleswara Temple. Going around the temple in detail   
will take about 2 hours. Then you can return to Asramam.   
2\. Or you can get into the book depot and browse and select books.   
3\. Or go into the meditation hall [Old Hall ] and meditate one or more   
hours.   
Then around 11.30 am they will provide South Indian lunch. After taking   
lunch, you can return to the guest room or the hotel and stay till 2.30 PM.   
Around 2.30 PM, the Samadhi Hall will be opened and you can go in there   
and meditate or do some chanting silently. Around 3.55 Pm, the bell will   
ring for tea/milk which you can take. After tea, you can come to Samadhi   
Hall and listen to book reading, in Tamizh and in English upto 4.50 PM.   
They will themselves provide books for following the reading.   
At 5.00 Pm, elaborate puja will start in Samadhi Hall for Ramaneswara   
Mahalingam and in between you can also go to the Mother's temple adjacent   
to it and watch some pujas there. You can also sit in Mother's Temple and do   
meditation. The evening puja will be over by 6.00 pm sharp. Thereafter there   
will be group chanting of Tamizh songs of Sri Bhagavan from 6.20 to 7.00 pm.   
Around 7.30 there will be dinner.   
On day 2, if you want you can do giri pradkashina, which will take about three   
hours. You have to start at least around 5,00 am and complete it by 8.00 am.   
You may have to skip the breakfast and join only the lunch since breakfast   
 will be over by 7.30 am.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Vengatesh,   
Yes. On a full moon night, one can go for giripradkashina without any   
anxiety, since there will be large crowds coming for the same. However,   
you have to move inch by inch due to crowd and this may take a little   
more time than usual. As otherwise, it is fine.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Vishnave,   
All days and all nights are auspicious for girivalam. The full moon is   
the most auspicious. But any visitor cannot always choose a full moon   
day. Each day is good and will confer the same benefits.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian.R   
Thanks for your answer, but what I means if during these special days there  
are, like a full moon day, a large crowds to do giripradkashina without any  
anxiety,   
Again thanks

Dear Vishnave,   
There will not be any large crowds, because people will be making   
preparations for Janmashtami or Ganesh Chaturthi and they will   
not prefer girivalam on that day. The outstation visitors will also be   
less, because they all will be celebrating festivals in their homes.

Dear Sir,   
Giri Pradakshina means only the outer road you refer right?   
And do you mean to say that in full moon days, there will be very huge crowds  
that it will be almost like a queue moving around?   
And what is the starting point and ending point for Giri Pradakshina?   
I have never done this. Only I have gone to Virupaksha cave and sometime  
planning to alight the full hill using one person who assist people and  
accompany them with professional charges.

Dear Krishna,   
Nowadays it is permitted only to use the outer road which is metalled.   
The inner forest road and the most inner route that skirts the Hill   
is not used. The crowds will be heavy in the sense, that they will   
all walk side by side in slow pace. Not a queue as it is. There will   
be some space between two horizontal batches.   
The Giripradkashina can be started from Temple and completed in   
Temple. Or from Sri Ramanasramam to Sri Ramanasramam.   
Arunachala Siva.**

As planned, I visited tiruvannamalai last weekend and did giri pradakshina on  
full-moon. The crowd was huge for giri prasakshina.   
Also visited ramanasramam, seshadri swamigal ashram and the temple.

Dear Vengatesh,   
I am happy that you had a successful visit to Tiruvannamalai, did   
giri valam and also had good darshan of Sri Bhagavan and Seshdri   
Swamigal Ashram. During Seshadri Swamigal's samadhi functions,   
Sri Bhagavan instructed his devotees how to build a samadhi as per   
Tirumoolar's Tirumandiram. He also went and stayed for full six   
hours of the function.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Vengatesh,   
Tirumoolar's Tirumandiram, a book of 3000 poems deals with many   
things, one being building a Samadhi and maintenance of it. The verses   
are cryptic and this is the only poetry version available and so every   
Math follows it.   
Tirumoolar says, about the depth, length and breadth of samadhis.   
He also tells what sort of place should be chosen. How the preliminary   
purificatory ceremonies should be done etc. etc., If this is not followed   
Samadhi will emanate negative powers and will cause damage to   
kings [in the olden days], subjects and the land [without crops not   
growing properly etc.,] and rains failing and famine will break out.   
Arunachala Siva.

Sri Bhagavan's Birthday: Dear Balaji,   
Thank you for the information. I had been there on Jayanti day only once. The  
celebrations were wonderful. The crowd was   
quite heavy. The Asramam fed everyone in many batches with sweet and special  
dishes.

Ramanashramam Kitchen Chapathis   
Kitchen News   
Yogiraja Sri Ramana Maharshi was an incarnation of Peace. In His Divine  
Presence dogs, cows and even wild animals like cheetah calmed down. A question  
may be asked as to whether there is anything in the world which could disturb  
His peace. Surprisingly the answer is yes, He did appear to be upset  
sometimes. What made Him upset? Conduct that didnt respect Samatva or  
equality troubled Him. For example, if He saw or even imagined that a dish  
was not served equally to everyone in the kitchen He would show His  
disapproval. Such is the glory of His spiritual attainment!   
In recent times, because of limited resources, ashram was serving Chappati  
only to a limited number of visitors on restricted diet. Happily ashram has  
now relaxed this rule by acquiring a special machine which makes Chappatis  
very fast. Now everyone can enjoy Chappati for dinner!!
