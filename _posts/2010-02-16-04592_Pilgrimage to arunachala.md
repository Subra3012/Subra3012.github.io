D.: Where has it been said that this knowledge is the all? On the other hand  
it is said that maya became the all.   
M.: Yes. Maya is the knowledge which is spoken of. Only this objective  
knowledge goes under the different names, maya, avidya, bondage, impurity,  
darkness, ignorance, the mind, the cycles of repeated births and deaths etc.   
D.: Be it so, what has this got to do with the extinction of the mind? M.: Listen. You must understand that the knowledge signified by all these terms is  
only the mind.   
32-33. D.: Who else says so? M.: Vasishta has said to Rama: Whatever  
objective knowledge manifests as this and that, or not this and not that, or  
in any other manner, it is only the mind. The mind is nothing but this  
manifest knowledge.   
34\. D.: Let it be so. How can the mind be extinguished? M.: To forget  
everything is the ultimate means. But for thought, the world does not arise.  
Do not think and it will not arise. When nothing arises in the mind, the mind  
itself is lost. Therefore do not think of anything, forget all. This is the  
best way to kill the mind.   
35-37.D.: Has anyone else said so before? M.: Vasishta said so to Rama thus: Efface thoughts of all kinds, of things enjoyed, not enjoyed, or otherwise.  
Like wood or stone, remain free from thoughts.   
Rama: Should I altogether forget everything? Vasishta: Exactly; altogether  
forget everything and remain like wood or stone.   
Rama: The result will be dullness like that of stones or wood.   
Vasishta: Not so. All this is only illusion. Forgetting the illusion, you are  
freed from it. Though seeming dull, you will be the Bliss Itself. Your  
intellect will be altogether clear and sharp. Without getting entangled in  
worldly life, but appearing active to others remain as the very Bliss of  
Brahman and be happy. Unlike the blue colour of the sky, let not the illusion  
of the world revive in the pure Ether of Consciousness-Self. To forget this  
illusion is the sole means to kill the mind and remain as Bliss. Though Shiva,  
Vishnu, or Brahman Himself should instruct you, realisation is not possible  
without this one means. Without forgetting everything, fixity as the Self is  
impossible. Therefore altogether forget everything.   
38-39. D.: Is it not very difficult to do so? M.: Though for the ignorant it  
is difficult, for the discerning few it is very easy. Never think of anything  
but the unbroken unique Brahman. By a long practice of this, you will easily  
forget the non-self. It cannot be difficult to remain still   
without thinking anything. Let not thoughts arise in the mind; always think of  
Brahman. In this way all worldly thoughts will vanish and thought of Brahman  
alone will remain. When this becomes steady, forget even this, and without  
thinking I am Brahman, be the very Brahman. This cannot be difficult to  
practise.   
40\. Now my wise son, follow this advice; cease thinking of anything but  
Brahman. By this practice your mind will be extinct; you will forget all and  
remain as pure Brahman.   
(Advaita Bodha Deepika)

Maya is Mother Uma. Siva is Father, the Self. Both are to be worshipped.   
Unless, one gets Uma's grace, Maya cannot be conquered. When Maya   
gets conquered, Maya merges with Siva, as Ardhanari. It is for the   
concorporate form that Unnamulai did penance in Arunachala and got   
merged with Siva. Maya in Bhagavan's words is mind-stuff. If   
Maya is overcome, then she becomes Maha Maya, Uma with Siva.   
Then, she guides the devotee to Siva, the self realization. Saint   
Manikkavachagar sings: I am praying to You, whose one half is the lady,   
my mother.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear grhluna,   
Nicw. Once some devotee wanted to take Bhagavan Ramana in a special   
train throughout India, so that He could see places! Bhagavan Ramana   
said: You are taking me, alright, but what can I see? (He is seeing nothing  
but the Self.).   
Sri Abhirami Bhattar who was a devi (goddess)-upasaka says in his poem: The the Redness of the Sun, and the Redness of the Heart, she stays in   
both the Red, the Lady with red-lotus like breasts! I see the red-lotus in   
her eyes, with nothing but compassion for me. Her face itself is a Red   
Lotus, and I see nothing but motherliness in her face. She is full of mercy  
and she gives me with her red-lotus like hands, and her two feet are like   
two lotuses.   
Sri Bhattar, sees in the sun and in the eyes, limbs and face of Mother   
only the Red Sun, which is metaphysical symbolism for Heart-Centre.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear grhluna,   
Excellent. We mock at a person who says "You are a man". But we ourselves   
do not believe we are men, at the first instance. Bhagavan Ramana has said   
that everyone is "I" \- the Self. But we do not believe it. We think, we are   
Subramanian, Nagaraj, Udai Shankar, Prasanth etc., etc., No one believes   
we are men. We believe in shirts, the sheaths but not in our Heart.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli/S.Lakshmi,   
What S.Lakshmi is referring should be at Seshadri Swamigal   
Ashram and other ashrams. Regarding Sri Ramanasramam, there   
is no fee but there is restriction to stay only for 3 days or at best   
4 days. Of course, all these Ashrams need prior approval and   
their confirmation.

Dear I,   
Usually, Sheshadri Ashramam, which is just next to Ramanashramam is the next  
best option. Their contact No is +91 4175 236999 and usually, accommodation is  
easily available!

Dear SLakshmi,   
Yes. As Nagaraj said Sri Seshadri Asramam is the second best. Or if   
you know Telugu, you can stay in Kavyakanta Sastri's Asramam (or   
Choultry?) by speaking to them over phone. My wife and a few of   
her bhajan friends went all by themselves and they stayed in that   
Asramam (or choulry).

Dear I,   
Yes, there is ample car parking space available at Sri Ramanashramam. it is a  
good idea to make the journey by car, there are a lot of places of interest in  
and around Arunachala.

Dear SLakshmi,   
It is safe for a single woman PROVIDED YOU TAKE ALL PRECAUTIONS. You are safe  
strictly within the ashram premises only. You are much better off in a group  
when you go to the town or when you climb the hill.   
Dear Subrap,   
You can park your car in the ashram. However the ashram gates close by 8.45PM.  
Your car cannot enter or leave the ashram after that time until around 6AM.  
Check with the office.

Dear Sadhak,   
Thanks for your advise. I think 8.45pm closure is fine with me, however, I  
will confirm it when I check in.

There are normally package tours to Arunachala from nearby cities like  
Chennai, Bangalore etc. These tours may not be wholly dedicated to  
Thiruvannamalai but cover other important places nearby like Pondichery etc.  
So any single person who would like to visit Arunachala but cannot make it by  
themselves may avail such tours. Oftentimes it more enjoyable to travel by  
package tours traveling worry free without having to take care of lot of  
arrangements.

In Tiruvannamalai, the best place to stay is either Sri Ramanasramam guest   
houses, or Sri Seshadri Swami Ashram rooms or Kavyakanta's choultry.   
For circumambulation, it is better to go with a group, even if they are   
unknown to you, but in circumambulation) than alone. The best time   
is Poornima time, like 28th Feb. Start at around 5 am and finish it before   
say, 9.30 am. Go by the outermost route, which is a tar-road. One should   
go without footwear, if one could bear with T'malai heat. You can take some  
water or cool drinks with you. Do not keep talking. Keep chanting some   
prayers and go. Kali is there at your sides, in front and in the back. This   
conviction is the most important.   
Arunachala Siva.
