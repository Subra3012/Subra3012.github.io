## Oh, is it you?  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 15, 2010, 05:36:37 AM

One afternoon, an old widow, about 60 years old, came with a   
group of women into the Old Hall, prostrated to Bhagavan Ramana   
and stood for sometime. Bhagavan Ramana looked at her and   
exclaimed: "Oh, Is it you?" The old lady became very shy and   
simply rushed out of the Old Hall.   
Bhagavan then told the devotees: Do you know who she is?   
Her family and my family were living in Tiruchuzhi in the same   
house in two portions. I used to go into our kitchen and help   
my mother in some odd jobs in cooking. Amma used to say   
that this girl would be married to me! However, this girl's   
mother used to say: "O, How can I marry my daughter to this   
boy, who always wears a codpiece and help his mother in cooking   
like a female?"   
Bhagavan continued: "Thank God, I did not marry her. There was   
no marriage in my life. Otherwise, what would have happened to   
me now?"   
The devotees laughed heartily, about the hidden meaning in   
Bhagavan Ramana's words!   
Arunachala Siva.

## "mano" equations  
Author: silentgreen         Date: January 11, 2010, 01:18:49 PM  
---  
In recent times circumstances have made me a little mathematical.   
So I felt like playing with equations..   
This is an equation of state: state = x*vasanas + y*thoughts_rising   
I was considering these equations: manolaya = many*vasanas + 0*thoughts_rising   
manonasa = 0*vasanas + many*thoughts_rising   
No conclusions, just joy of exploring.

Dear silentgreen,   
Your post.   
I think, mano-nasa = 0 vasanas + a few thoughts rising.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear I,   
Quote

The one that is saying this is Mind itself, because its only agenda is to keep  
going, continuity.   
'I' is there, then all equations are there,   
'I' is not there, then there are no equations at all.   
Even for thoughts to exist, there must be someone to possess them, the one  
desirous of possessing them is 'I', Mind, thoughts themselves.   
Thoughts are nothing but Vasanas themselves.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Subramanian.R,   
What you say is more appropriate.   
However to preserve the diagonal beauty of the equations (as mathematicians  
like) I would replace "many" with "some" in both the equations. "Some" can  
signify both few and quite a bit depending on the context.   
So the equations become: state = x*vasanas + y*thoughts   
manolaya = some*vasanas + 0*thoughts   
manonasa = 0*vasanas + some*thoughts   
Dear Nagaraj,   
What you raised is a good point.   
Can thoughts exist without vasanas?   
Substituting the condition that thoughts cannot exist without vasanas, I get: manolaya = 0*vasanas + 0*thoughts = 0   
manonasa = 0*vasanas + 0*thoughts = 0   
So manolaya = manonasa   
It is threatening the validity of the equations themselves.   
No conclusions but simple explorations.

Dear I,   
Quote

Yes it is, it is a threat of life, or death itself for the mind, thought, ego,  
I. But some how, this mind/ego/I/thought wants to strike a compromise the best  
of both sides, it wants to continue to be there along with 'Self defined  
realisation' hence it keeps arriving at various different options and  
conclusions, because it wants to be there all the time!

## Re:[5] "mano" equations

Today I was trying out some new equations: consciousness_in_deep_sleep + thoughts = jagrat   
so, jagrat - thoughts = consciousness_in_deep_sleep   
However Jnanis are said to have no thoughts in jagrat but their state cannot  
be said to be consciousness_in_deep_sleep.   
Do I need to frame another equation,   
state_of_jnani + thoughts = jagrat?   
But then I fall into an even greater trouble: consciousness_in_deep_sleep = state_of_jnani   
I am running into fallacies since learning equations.   
Since all these are thoughts, why fret the small stuff?

Dear I,   
Honestly, how much ever, clues you try to gather about the state of  
consciousness, it is always going to fall short. because by ascertaining these  
equations, only the mind is being fueled, so that this mind can try and be  
like the consciousness. Mind has to cease completely.   
Those equations may seem correct only to the extent of what the Mind sees the  
Perfect Self to be.   
The Self is beyond all these possible equations and anything the Mind can  
comprehend!   
Those equations you mentioned are definitely very carefully analysed ones by  
the mind. It may seem to give great sense of achievement of knowing the  
reality of Realisation and the Self, but it is all just thoughts and Mind  
only. This is what the Mind is doing - it keeps giving out thoughts so that  
thoughts can continue!   
Manonasam is inevitable.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
What you say is correct.   
However much we analyze with the mind, it will fall short (although it may  
give good indications).   
That is the "humour".

Dear silentgreen, Nagaraj,   
There is a book called The Chess Mind, written by Gerald Abrams.   
This book analyzes the mind of grandmasters in chess. Some   
of them like Alekine, (who became a world champion at a young   
age), was literally a madcap. He was not fit for anything else   
in life. But before a chessboard, his mind got oriented somehow   
and he played wonderful chess. The chess superstar of recent   
times, Bobby Fischer was also an eccentric. He always preferred   
a room without glass windows. He defeated Boris Spassky and   
became the first American World Champion. After the first game,   
which he had lost he was 0-1, the second game he defaulted by   
not appearing in time, he was 0-2. From the third game, he showed   
his prowess and became 12.50-6.50, (with three games to spare!)   
and became the world champion.   
In the case of some painters like Van Gogh, they were excellent   
painters. But in normal life, they were eccentric. He was not goodlooking  
but he loved a girl. When that girl said that his ears   
were not beautiful, he cut off his ears and sent them to his girlfriend.   
In case of Frederich Nietszhe, he was a madcap. But he did not   
believe in God and found a new religion with the head as Zarathustra. (This is  
not to be confused by Zorastrianism of Parsis.)   
His famous book is Thus Spake Zarathustra. In his old age he   
became sick and totally mad and was lying in bed with heavy   
medication. Someone was reading his book Thus Spake Zarathustra   
sitting at his bedside. Niteszhe told him: "What a beautiful   
writing! I have also written some books like that!"   
The great mathematical wizard Srinivasa Ramanujan, who died   
at his middle age due tp tuberculosis, was a prodigy in Numerical equations.  
He was sent to Cambridge specially for research, though he was not even a  
graduate. Some of his theorems in his Last Note Book, are yet to be solved!  
You can read the book, The Man who   
knew Infinity to know more about Ramanujan.   
The mind is a wondrous power in Atma Swarupa..... says Bhagavan Ramana in His  
Who am I? That is why all seekers try to kill this mind or kill the thoughts  
to reach the Self. Mind manifests the world   
and until and unless the world disappears the Self will not reveal   
itself. These two are like the typical advaitic paradox, rope and the   
snake.   
Arunachala Siva.
