## Arunachala mountain

I have not read arunachala puranam. Today I listened that, when we go around  
the hill we should walk slowly without talking. The gentleman was telling in  
DD podhigai.   
when we go there all the air we breath is siddhas breath (what they exale).  
All the pebbles and stones contains the vibrations of siddas and Bhagavan   
Ramana Maharishi. So we should walk so carefully there. Those who realaised  
this they are all blessed, he said.   
I think it is equal to Mount kailas, and it is easy to reach thruvannamalai  
rather than manasarovar.   
Kailas is full of ice and thruvanamalai is fire (jnana agni)   
All siddas live in kailas or in annamalai.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. What you say is correct. Kailas is only the house of   
Siva. But Arunachala is Siva Himself. So pradakshina of   
the Hill is equal to pradakshina of Siva. There is one   
Arunachala Puranam in Tamil. This is based on Arunachala   
Mahatmyam in Sanskrit, which is in Skandam. This Tamil   
book is quite readable and all the stories are there. Sri   
Ramanasramam has published this book, with Tamil verses   
and meaning thereof. You can buy this and read this book.   
All the stories regarding, Brahma and Vishnu trying to find   
out the top and bottom of the Light, Indra, Guatama Maharshi,   
Uma doing penance to get half the body of Siva, the story   
of Vajrangadha Pandyan, Siddhas, the merits of pradakshina   
are all vividly described there.   
Arunachala Siva.
