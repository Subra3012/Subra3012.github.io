So Vishnu awakened Prahlada, blessing him with eternal life and jivanmukti.  
Deva-asura fight was resumed and the old order of things was restored so that  
the universe continues in its eternal nature.   
Devotee: How could God Himself wake up the asura element and bring about constant  
warfare? Is not Pure Goodness the nature of God?   
Bhagavan: Goodness is only relative. Good always implies bad also; they always co-exist.  
The one is the obverse of the other.

Dear prasanth,   
Good and bad or for that matter, all dyads including bondage and   
liberation is in the ego. Bhagavan has explained this in Verse 39   
of ULLadu Narpadu. [Bandhanai irukkum matte bandha mukti chintanaigal]. While  
covering this Verse, Muruganar has described   
these dyads in some of his verses of Padamalai: Verse 548: If bondage and liberation are creations of the mind, all   
the experiences and states manifested through suttarivu [objective   
consciousness] are likewise only concepts.   
Verse 2205: The origin of the concepts of bondage and liberation   
is in the ego, the deception that is the cause of the PAIRS OF OPPOSITES.   
Dwanda Buddhi, the pairs of opposites, generally refer to such pairings, as  
heat and cold, joy and misery, and so on. Here it would also include bondage  
and liberation.   
Verse 2405: It is because the mind, the vain ego, is habitutated   
to the thought of bondage that enthusiastic efforts, to attain   
liberation, arise.   
Verse 1000: If you enquire into the Self and come to know it, in that vision  
of the Self, the age-old primal illusion of bondage will become a story long  
forgotten.   
Arunachala Siva.
