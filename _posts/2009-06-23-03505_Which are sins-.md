2\. Egg consuming   
3\. Smoking   
4\. Drinking   
etc.

Dear searchingme,   
Bhagavan Ramana said that Sattvic food [vegetarian food]   
in moderate quantities will be an aid for Atma Vichara. He   
did not say anything about smoking, drinking etc., When   
Western devotees came to Him, they stopped the meat/egg   
eating on their own after sometime. This Sattvic food details   
come in Who am I? Those days in the Hill, the sadhus were   
taking ganja [cannabis] for concentrating the mind. This   
will create some state of stupor and keep the mind thought   
free i.e. not bothering about anything and tension free. This is supposed to  
be 25 times stronger than tobacco. Once   
even Bhagavan Ramana was given a huge ball of ganja. He   
took it since it was offered by a devotee-sadhu. Mother   
Azhagamma was present at that time! She found her son's   
eyes becoming blood red. But it did not cause any change   
in His attiude and He was quite normal. When asked, Bhagavan   
Ramana told his devotees not to resort to ganja. In His days,   
some devotees used to have snuff. It was a fashion those   
days. Bhagavan Ramana did not have any objection to this!   
Arunachala Siva.

hmm, thanks for the reply. But, I'm still confused if those are sins or not.  
He never mentioned it, but does that mean he does wanted people to do that?

Dear searchingme,   
I trust that I never used the word sin or said that Bhagavan   
Ramana said they were all sins. He had views on meat   
eating and egg eating, that is all. He has also clearly said   
that these [meat & egg] are not sattvic [in the negative sense].   
Sattvic is only which helps your Sattvic guna [purity of mind]. The other  
habits like non vegetarian food, ganja etc., are not   
sattvic but rajasic or tamasic or both, in the sense that they   
produce aggression and dullness. In fact non-injury to other   
living beings is the virtue spoken of, by Buddhism and Jainisim   
also, even though Hindus do not follow this in the strictest   
sense. The Saivites and Brahmins do not take non vegetarian   
food inlcuding egg, but permit greens and roots, which   
are vegetarian. But Jains do take too far. A strict Jain does   
not take even potatoes and carrots and greens! In Tiru   
Jnana Sambandhar's days, Jains were eating with their hands   
and no leafplates! They wore dry leaves and not cotton dress.   
They plucked their hairs, because, the knife will harm the   
lice! They did not burn lights at night, because the fire-flies   
will get attracted and get killed! This is the highest Jainism.   
But Hindus [Saivites and Brahmins] do not take only eggs,   
birds, fish and animal flesh.   
Sin question comes only from the point of view of injury to   
living beings. But Bhagavan Ramana approached it from   
the point of view keeping a stable and calm and non aggressive and non-dull  
mind. He had no opinion on sin aspect. Once   
a devotee told Him: 'Are there not lives in plants and trees?'   
Bhagavan replied: 'Yes. But for that matter even the slab   
on which you are sitting has also got lives.' The stone slab   
on which one sits may have a million bacteria! The table and   
chairs even if they have no bacteria have millions of electrons revolving  
around the proton and neutron. They are in constant motion. It is surmised  
that they have lives! You disturb   
the electronic movement by sitting on it.   
Arunachala Siva.

Shastras mention about Five Big Sins which one should not do. 1.don't lie  
2don't steal 3.don't drink liqour 4.don''t covet another man's wife.   
5.don't kill. Even the Ten commandments in Bible prescribes injunction of  
such acts.Any malice act to harm others is a sin.   
Prayer and helping others is Punya.--Merit. Bhagavan has clarified that  
merits-Punya and Papa can not be adjusted and the concept that only net effect  
will be derived is false. Good deed produces good result and Bad deed  
produces bad efffect. Papa-sin is transferable,so is Merit-Punya. In the case  
of Sage Valmiki, the author of Ramayana,his family memebers refused to share  
his sins.Saints like Bhagavan willingly consumes the sins of devotees. In  
Mahabaratha, Lord Krishna beseeched Karna to transfer his Punya to him which  
is only a blessing.   
The spiritual evolution is only to balance the sins and merits and become a  
clean slate-zero balance. That is the flash point of Jnana.

Dear arcsekar,   
Yes. You are correct. The perfect balancing of merits and sins   
give a person liberation. Only merits and no sins, take one to   
Vaikunta or Kailasa and you have to come back when the score   
is finished. Only sins push one to hell and from there you have   
to come back when the score is finished.   
Alright. What about merits and sins of a Brahma Jnani like   
Bhagavan Ramana. He says in ULLadu Narpadu - Anubandham,   
that the merits are transferred to the devotees who do service   
to Him and pray to Him and the sins are transferred to the   
persons who abuse Him or disrespect Him. So, a Brahma Jnani   
always maintains a perfect balance in the state of Realization.   
Arunachala Siva.

What I tell here is not what maharishi use to say but just a concept as such  
……regarding meat eating.   
All food products be it veg or non-veg are made up of elements and hence all  
are almost similar in their elementary structure and are predominantly  
tamasic. Be it known that some of the veg food like white onion, onion,  
drum-stick, spices etc., are lot more tamasic than meat.   
There are no bad karmic affects incurred because of eating non-veg for  
survival because the intention of the person eating (or the person  
slaughtering) is not to cause pain, revenge on the animal. However relishing  
the meal - be it veg/non-veg can be called as a sin based upon the perception  
of the individual who classifies what is sin and what is just a karma.   
The point to note here is the option the mind gets/uses for itself to delude  
and project that the I or the individual is the body. If mind gets an  
occasion for example, like enjoying a tasty meal (in this case) it is one tiny  
step down the spiritual ladder. The sensory organs are gates of mind or a  
part of the mind itself, the tongue being one!   
Although the butcher/slaughterer may be a good person by nature, if he is ill  
equipped to kill the animal instantaneously and suffocates it to death, he is  
committing blunder and a small part of it is transferred to those persons who  
eat the animal. Eating meat derived from such horrible places for years  
together, accrues enough karma on the person to interfere with his spiritual  
sadhana. Other factors like the way the animal is treated, fed, transported  
etc., also counts.   
If a meat-eating person is ignorant of the above, that doesn't mean he is  
escaping the karmic effects. Karmic effect depends on cause and only on cause  
and not whether the cause is known, understood or even exists. It is like  
for example: a good person inherits the wealth of his father/ancestors who had  
become rich by cheating, plundering and paining others. Bad karma flows to  
that person who ENJOYS such wealth be him a good person and totally ignorant  
about the initial source of the inherited wealth.   
As already mentioned, just by eating veg food, one cannot escape from the  
bindings of food. What is important is not what one should eat but how one  
should eat. Other than the physical body and intellect (higher mind), the  
mind should not take part in the process of eating. Pure mind really means no-  
mind or a state of mindlessness. When a person eats with a state of  
mindlessness, he eats for the sake of survival and not for the sake of taste  
buds because of which there is only an eating process or an experience and no  
place for emotions, craving, rejection or any external effect of food on the  
individual. This is true not just with food, but anything and everything one  
finds duty-bound. This is what is called Karma Yoga. Not following such  
principle binds one to the mind-body; veg or non-veg really makes no sense.  
That's the reason you can easily find in your daily lives notorious  
vegetarians and pious non-vegetarians. A contrasting example is Hitler and  
Sw.Vivekananda.   
What one has to be watchful towards meat eating people is never to allow the  
impressions like hatred, superiority complex, judging them as low or  
evolutionary. Such attitude bloats one's ego and pulls him down the spiritual  
ladder. Most of the vegetarians who are just hereditary vegetarians belong to  
this category and really cause more harm to their spiritual growth though they  
may lead religious lives or born in religious caste   
It is fanatical to say that only vegetarians (or Indians) could be spiritual.   
One may not give up eating meat if one is not matured enough to do so. For  
evolutionary persons, suppression of one's lower desires is actually  
oppression of spiritual growth. In such case and for those categories that  
don't cause physical harm, one has to discipline himself with regulated  
indulgence. Abstinence is best….but that requires maturity. That being said  
if one eats meat (in the right method mentioned above) for other's sake i.e,  
for his/her spouse/parents etc., and treats it as a field of experience,  
actually dissolves more of his ego by eating meat and grows spiritually.. It  
is only the attitude that really works………   
The one who has taken pains to read all of the above may put himself in the  
category he feels is more suited for him and take decisions accordingly.   
My one paise worth…….

Replying to Mrs.Piggot, Maharshi has stated that there are potential lives in  
eggs (Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi - Talk 24 - 4th February 1935).
