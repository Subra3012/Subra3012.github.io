## The feeling of being

Feeling of just being is not a sensation coming through physical senses, it is  
discerning what belongs to the physical aspect I.e: body, emotions, thoughts  
and so on, from what is consciousness non dependent on anything to be felt. On  
the contraire, it is only when all emotions, thoughts and sensual perceptions  
are removed that it can be felt. The word feeling is used to clarify this  
discerning. It is just a word pointing to something, it is not the thing  
itself but mind reacts to words according to its conditioning and then accepts  
or refuses them depending on if mind´s ideas, believes or understandings are  
reaffirmed or contradicted by those words. If we can´t go beyond words  
because we get stuck by them, how can we go beyond feelings, in the  
conventional meaning of this word? I wonder, because these feelings are  
generated by words most of times. If there is not discernment, how can we know  
that we are feeling the pure being or we are just taking the idea of what is  
the self by the self itself? Mind can do this, and it does; it lives from  
ideas, ideas feed the mind and it feels fine with that: the idea of self,  
peace, silence and so on. The word feeling is used to point to what is  
beyond ideas, to what can´t be questioned by mind. In fact, when mind feels  
or touches the being through discernment it becomes what it perceives because  
all its movements get suspended by that touch or feeling and there is only  
being. Simply. Easily. Difficulty is in going on through the jungle that is  
the mind, avoiding all its intelligent tricks in order to deceive itself, only  
with the help of discernment. But it is only discernment what gives to the  
mind a subtle quality that enables it to Know; no people, no books, nor even  
a guru. So many people went, and goes, away from Bhagavan without feeling a  
single thing   
Well, I´m sorry if I perturbed this site somehow. I´ll just leave this post  
here for those who may be interested and can understand what one means when  
one talks on feelings, as I do understand them. Beyond readings, prejudices,  
words and ideas. Thanks.

Dear shadak,   
Nice. Becoming takes one to Being. Becoming is full of   
emotions. Being is just experience.   
Sri Ramakrishna told this story. Once a group of friends,   
climbed the ladder one by one, to see what is on the other   
side. Each one climbed up and came back saying: It is wonderful. It is  
wonderful!" One fellow climbed the ladder   
and simply jumped to the other side. He did not come back   
to describe anything. Describing, I think, is all feeling.   
Jumping to the other side is the experience.   
Saint Tayumanavar says in one poem. Girls who were to be   
married soon were all describing what it would be to get   
married and have conjugal life. One girl got married. She   
went into the nuptial room. Next morning, she came out,   
did not utter a word. Even to her mother, who was anxiously waiting outside,  
she simply smiled and rushed into the bathroom to have a face wash!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Yes. The more you talk on the self the more you move away from yourself. I´ve  
realized that it is good to be alone regarding to this issue and that there is  
not reason for complaining about it. Thanks to Bhagavan for the trip   
This site is nice, anyway, and you seems to be a good man. Best wishes.

Dear shadak,   
Thank you. I am repeating what Muruganar said, he wrote   
30,000 verses on Bhagavan Ramana. He said: "I am only   
a pen, my Master writes everything." Nowadays I feel   
that unless Bhagavan Ramana writes everything, I cannot   
do. How can the pen write by itself?   
Arunachala Siva.
