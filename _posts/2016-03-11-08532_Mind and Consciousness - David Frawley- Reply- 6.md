Self Realization: The yogic dictum is 'I am that I am', 'I am that which is, that which was and  
that which will be'.   
'I am therefore I can think', Yet this 'I' is neither me nor you, nor anyone  
else. One who could say   
that it is God, but it is not God of any belief, theology or philosophy. It  
is the Divine Being that is the   
being of all. It is the Self of existence, the Self-being that is the ocean  
of which all creatures and all worlds   
are but waves. In that Self is the resolution of all of our problems,  
conflicts, stress, anxiety and agitation.   
When one has gone home to one's true nature, there are no more issue to  
resolve.   
Yoga defines its supreme goal of liberation as the realization of the inner  
Self or Purusha. 'Only by knowing   
the Purusha can one go beyond death. There is no path to transcendence. ' So  
knowledge of the Purusha   
or inner Being is the most important thing in life, not just a knowledge of  
our mental and emotional tendencies, however valuable these may be for dealing  
with psychological diseases.   
Unless we know our inner Being, we cannot find lasting peace. Knowledge of  
our being depends upon being,   
not upon mental activity. The problem is that instead of seeking to know our  
inner Being, we get caught in our   
outer becoming. We run after the mental, emotional or physical self and lose  
our Being Self within. This   
process is Samsara or the turning of the wheel of sorrow.   
Usually we think of Self Realization as the realization of our hidden personal  
potentials, some special abilities   
or talents we might not have yet developed. However, Yogic Self Realization  
is the understanding that   
our true Self is beyond body and mind, which also means beyond psychology,  
culture and conditioning.   
It is the dissolution of the personal psychological self into the Being Self  
that is not born and does not die.   
True consciousness is not the embodied mind, which is a conditioned  
consciousness, a mere collection of   
tendencies and activities from our various births. True consciousness is a  
universal principle and power   
like space. It cannot be limited to any body or mind. The mind can at best  
reflect it, which requires that   
the mind be still, subtle and sensitive within. We must learn to move from  
embodied consciousness or mind,   
to the non embodied universal consciousness, in which we transcend our  
personal self to the universal consciousness, in which we transcend our  
personal self to the universal Self. This occurs when we go to the   
root of the mind and discover the light of awareness that radiates through it.
