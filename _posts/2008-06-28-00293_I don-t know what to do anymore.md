## Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi and widow remarriages.  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 21, 2008, 09:05:28 AM

Dear members, yesterday I was watching a Hindi serial on Shirdi   
Sai Baba, wherein he was telling that he was for remarriages of   
young girls, who have lost their husbands. This made me think to ask   
you, whether this topic was discussed with Bhagavan and whether He   
has given His views. Arunachala Siva.

## Vichara Mani Mala and Bhagavan  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 27, 2008, 01:42:29 PM  
---  
Mahatma Nischaladas wrote the Hindi Vichara Sagara. This was   
translated into Tamil by name Vichara Sagaram by someone later.   
When one Arunachala Mudaliar, told Bhagavan that this Tamil   
version is too difficult to read, Bhagavan wrote a simpler extract   
called Vichara Mani Mala. Since the authorship was originally claimed   
by Arunachala Mudaliar. Since Bhagavan had no interest in authorship,   
He left it at that. The Tamil "Complete Works", upto 1997 edition,   
did not contain this extract. However, it is found in Arthur Osborne's   
2002 edition, in Bhagavan's name. Vichara Mani Mala, contains   
a good dialogue between Guru and disciple, regarding relative truth   
(vyavaharika satya; empirical truth) and personal truth (pratibhasika   
satya) which are experienced in waking state and dream state. (srkudai,   
please see this book). Arunachala Siva.

## Chenkottai Avudai Akka  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 26, 2008, 11:32:19 AM  
---  
Chenkottai Avudai Akka (The Elder Sister Auvdai of Chenkottai)   
was an illiterate, who had great insights about the Self and she   
lived about 350 years in a place called Chenkottai in Southern   
Tamil Nadu. Her simple songs on bhakti, breath-control and jnana   
are excellent pieces. Bhagavan's Mother Azhagammal and other   
elderly ladies of Tamil Nadu were knowing these songs and singing   
them during their daily household chores. Mother Azhagammal   
used to sing these songs in Virupakshi Cave and Skandasramam.   
A sample of Auvdai's song:- "Oh, come and cross the ocean of   
samsara, with faith in Guru and restlessness in your minds, we   
shall soon reach the 'island' where our Guru is waiting for us   
with extended hands and a lot of eagerness. You need only to   
discard your homes and all the attendant care with faith only in   
Guru!"   
Arunachala Siva.

## Guru Gita  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 28, 2008, 09:46:59 AM  
---  
Guru Gita, is a dialogue between Siva and Parvati, highlighting the   
importance of meditation on Guru and the results from such a meditation. The  
book is of 352 verses and there are versions with a difference in   
number of verses. The Divine Life Society of Swami Sivananda, has   
come out with an English version and Sri Ramakrishna Math of   
Chennai has come out with a Tamil version. It is an excellent treatise   
on Advaita. Verse 92 says: "O Dear Parvati, Guru is Siva without   
three eyes. He is Hari with two hands. He is again Brahma without   
four faces." Verse 125 says: " Thus meditating on the Guru, one   
acquires real knowledge. One should then strongly feel, ' By the   
teachings of the Guru, I am liberated.' Arunachala Siva.

## I don't know what to do anymore  
Author: Matthew             Date: June 28, 2008, 08:20:20 PM  
---  
Hey,   
I'm a 26 year old male from Canada. I had a very safe, suburbanite, middle  
class upbringing. I went on to complete a degree in Psychology and have since  
spent most my time working in the various human services fields.   
I was a very normal, happy, social kid up until about grade seven. I had  
matured emotionally and intellectually a bit ahead of my peers and this  
created a divide. I became very reclusive, overweight, and indulgent in a  
haze that lasted for many years. While in University I finally lost the  
weight and started a new phase of my life.   
When I was about 13 I would buy books on psychology and I ended up getting one  
that included information on altered states of consciousness that fascinated  
me. I got more into altered states and that eventually lead me to Buddhism  
since many experiences people reported from altered states resonated well with  
the Buddhist experience. Even Papaji mentioned that some of the people he met  
who had tried psychedelics spoke statements that were indicative of glimpses  
into the things the scriptures speak of.   
Thankfully I didn't get stuck in Buddhism. Too much tradition and people  
imitating something without having the deep understanding for themselves.   
Eventually and thankfully I found my way to David Bohm and Krishnamurti, and  
then finally Ramana Maharshi, Nisargadatta Maharaj, and Papaji. Since finding  
those people nothing has resonated with me more.   
My practices or my interests have never been that serious. I live a deeply  
conflicted life with a gemini personality that often destroys whatever I build  
up. I have so many interests and so many things on the go but none of them I  
go far enough into. Something always pulls me back to this whole ayurvedic  
pursuit. It's always in my heart and in the back of my mind. Usually I am  
pursuing more worldly things though.   
I'm at a point where I find it extraordinarily difficult to relate to other  
people. My interests and theirs tend to be opposite. I come across as a very  
serious, non-fun kind of person to them, but when I fake being a fun person I  
never feel right and it never goes that well anyway. No one I meet ever  
understands me or listens or attends to me the way I do them. I am social and  
go to many events by myself but so rare do I meet anyone and usually after  
speaking with them for a few minutes I find nothing in them that resonates  
with me and vice versa. I've been in a few relationships lately that ended  
painfully because I chose a partner who seems to be very caring and unselfish  
but in the end mind dominates so much and I am not providing them with the  
kind of experience they want so it doesn't work out. But I cannot fake it, I  
cannot put in that effort to create a certain kind of experience for them  
apart from what comes naturally for me to do.   
I just don't know what to do anymore. I do want more friends, and I do want a  
partner again. Then there is part of me that is tempted to leave everything  
worldly behind and pursue only this one simple truth (the teachings of Ramana  
Maharshi).   
My professional experiences have been very unpleasant. Most the places I have  
worked at are considered good, fun places to work at by most people, but for  
me it's horrible. The lack of intelligence, the lack of a deep concern for  
the well being of all of us, the inattention that is promoted and fostered,  
the conditioning and brainwashing to certain beliefs that are held, etc.   
I go to some of the Buddhist groups locally, and there they speak the exact  
opposite of Advaita. They talk about the constant effort you have to put in  
because it's easy to bad things but hard to do good ones. They talk about how  
you have to mediate to reach the highest level of meditation. Even though the  
monk has been meditating for 40 years he wants more time to do all this. He  
wants us all to accept slow, gradual progress in time to move towards a goal  
that apparently none of the Buddhists really reach or maybe 1 every 1000  
years. They talk about being able to fly, read other people's minds, and walk  
on water as benchmarks of being enlightened... I just want to understand  
myself and be happy.   
What to do, what to do. I'm just frustrated and depressed. Thank you for  
taking the time to listen -- I am hoping here is a place with people who can  
understand and relate. Feel free to make any comments; I'd be happy to hear  
anything.

Dear Matthew, I will say that you ended up well with Ramana Maharshi.   
Read His books. To know what is happening at a distant place or to   
know other people's mind or to know past, present and future, is   
not enlightenment. Bhagavan says that to stay in the Self is the   
real wisdom-insight and not these three things. Eat simple vegetarian food.  
Being in West, do not resort to drugs for enlightenment. These   
will not confer enlightenment. Be friendly and compassionate to poeple   
but do not interfere with their lives or any other worldly matters. If   
you are distraught, ask for Bhagavan Ramana's Grace. It is flowing   
perennially but you should 'seek' it. Bhagavan's cinema-screen   
example is excellent. Be a screen, a witness. When the show is   
over, only screen remains as a silvery brilliance and you will hear   
a low monotone of Ramana which will be with you always. There   
is no need to go away from society or embrace ascetism or shirk your   
regular work. These things can go hand in hand with self-enquiry.   
Ultimately the screen will remain for ever and you in the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.

I have read several books containing Ramana's words.   
I've read many more books by Krishnamurti, Papaji, Bohm, and Nisargadatta.   
The part I'm having the hardest time with is regarding my worldly pursuits and  
desire for friendship and relationships.   
Can I have it all, can I pursue both a worldly life and understanding the self  
at the same time, or does the worldly have to be put aside until one is steady  
enough in their awareness of the ever present self?   
My desire for the worldly life is very strong so suppressing it would not be  
easy or perhaps even directly possible.

Dear Mathew   
With people like Subramanian and nonduel and others i am whole heap immature  
to comment.But still i am making an effort.   
You are frustrated want to leave everything becoz you are not getting what you  
want. The root cause is the desire to have friends, partner etc which you  
think would give you happiness/pleasure. But is it true??   
 **The purpose of life for all beings is to achieve continuous permanent  
happines unadulterated or unmixed with sorrows and sufferings.** Since, you  
have already experienced so much of unhappiness in worldly life hence it  
proves that having friend, partner, or money is not the source of permanent  
happiness/satisfaction.   
For small small happiness/ pleasures people work so hard but where lies the  
permanent happiness/pleasure, we dont want to put at all any efforts.   
Dont leave World for Lord just becoz everybody or scripture says so. Just  
THINK!   
Its all a matter of choice. Its all in MIND. the happiness, the sorrows, these  
all are mind's play.   
I would like to illustrate a small story here: There were two friends namely Max & Sam of the same village. They both decided  
to go to foreign and earn some good money. Both went and started earning money  
there. Initially they communicated with their parents and gave them their  
address and all. After some time, the parents of both the boys got no  
communication from them and were quite worried. somebody from their village  
was going to the very same country and hence they asked him to visit their son  
also. The man went to that country and tried searching for the boys. After  
some effort he met Max who had become quite wealthy and was very happy. He  
enquired about Sam to which Max told that he died after 6 months only.   
After reaching back to his village, he got confused between Max and Sam. He  
could not remember who had died and who is alive. Hence, he told to Sam's  
parents that your son is doing very well, he is happy and very wealthy. The  
parents got very happy and started celebrating. On the other hand, he told to  
Max parents that your son has demised and the parents were devastated.   
In reality, the Max was alive and Sam was dead. But see the reaction of the  
parents!!   
So buddy its all in MIND. The sorrows and the happiness...   
Dont struggle hard to avoid sorrows and to get happiness. The sorrows are  
dirty/bumpy roads and the happiness are good roads of life. Tighten your hold  
on the steering which is Mind and put the gear of Lord's name. You will  
eventually reach to your Destination.   
OM!

Dear Matthew, adding to what Shivani has already covered,   
Bhagavan has said going to work, for minimum worldly comforts, like some  
money for simple vegetarian food, a shelter, clothes do not   
come in the way of your pursuing Wisdom. One need not go to   
a lonely island or jungle to pursue Wisdom. One can live in this   
world among people and can still do that. One should not direct noisy   
his mind in unncessary worldly matters or in other people's jobs.   
One can live anywhere, if he could control his mind. Similarly,   
one need not separately allot time for meditation. Meditation can   
be the underlying montone in your work-situation. Arunachala Siva.

Hey Matthew, hang in there Buddy. Don't despair you are on the right track. I  
was in a somewhat similar place in the 60's. In my case it was the fear of  
death that seized me and put me into that awful place. I came up with a way to  
push this fear aside so that I could function. Read about a guy named Eckhart  
Tolle who went thru your experience and came out of it fully realized and  
filled with joy. Sane thing happened to me. Fortunately a guy I encountered  
handed me a copy of "Who Am I" which was like looking at a map of where I had  
been. It seems the only way to heaven on earth is thru the gates of hell.  
Ramana went that way, Budha went that way and it seems J. C. also. 40 days in  
the desert, a form of hell for him. Zen gives a person a riddle that drives  
them to a state of despair that will put them in that place where heaven and  
hell meet. It has been almost 40 years since my experience and I checked out  
everything related to the subject and I always return to Maharshi as the  
purest way. Even checked out a guy named Spinoza who stated that god was every  
where and was the universal substate of the world. Maharshi recommended  
staying fully involved with the world and he was right as the world for me is  
endleesly fascinating and joyful. I say read "Who Am I" then st down and  
realize that you are not your mind, you are the I of the I and I think that  
will work.   
By the way my name is Dave Mahar and it is coincedence that the name is  
similar to Maharshi.   
I just thought of another interesting person. A Lady by the name of Byron  
Katie. Check out her and Eckhart Tolle, they both have websites and both are  
charging substancial fees to come and kisten to their lectures. I can't  
imagine what they have to say as from my point of view "The Tao that can be  
described is not the Tao".

Dear Matthew, As Davemahar said, fear of death is the primordial fear,   
from where every other fear sprouts. Here again, fear of death only is fear  
and not death by itself. Fear of death is fear of losing something known to  
you, the body, the senses, the mind et al. Please read 'Who am I?' and   
that is more than sufficient. You can read Zen Buddhism, Bible and whole   
range of western philosophy -- from Francis Bacon to Kant, Spinoza,  
Shophenheur, Nietszhe and Bertrand Russel. In my case, at least, all these  
readings only confused me. A little bit of Sankara and then Bhagavan Ramana  
Maharshi will do. Good luck.   
Arunachala Siva.

Buddhism is a jungle. Once you step in, it is difficult to find which way you  
should go.   
Unless you are born in Buddhism tradition, I do not recommend you to go into  
Buddhism.   
Many Buddhism schools, which are active in America and Europe,   
teach strange teachings which have nothing to do with orthodox Buddhism.   
I think it is good to stick to Bhagavan Ramana only.   
His teaching is simple and clear.   
You have little chance to go astray.   
And forget Poonja(Papaji) and Nisargadatta (in my opinion).   
I see a problem here.   
A man who compiled a famous book on Bhagavan Ramana also wrote on Poonja and  
Nisargadatta.   
So some people could automatically accept Poonja and Nisargadatta as good  
gurus as Bhagavan Ramana.   
You have to think carefully with your common sense   
and judge whether they speak truth or they just try to spin your head with  
nonsense.   
This is only my opinion.

Nisarga Datta Maharaj and Papaji must have said the same thing as Bhagavan  
Ramana.   
But their teachings confuse me. I am more at home with Bhagavan Ramana.  
Perhaps,   
the tuning up, differs from person to person. The Guru, if you lead your life  
as the   
way he had said or shown, never forsakes the devotee/disciple. It like a fawn  
caught   
in the tiger's jaw.

At least you have the capacity to understand that you do not know what to do  
anymore.   
Moreover you are not the one in this vast world who do not know what to do  
anymore. Do not afraid, there are many more people who do not know what to do  
anymore. It is a good sign and the good beginning. When Arjuna realised that  
he could not fight from his whole heart, he had Darshan of Krishna and cleared  
his doubt. In the same way, ask Bhagavan what to do now. Just He will smile.  
You would be still. That is all. Every thing will be over.

If someone goes to Bhagavan Ramana and says: I do not know   
what to do," He would ask: "Find out this "I", which is telling,   
"I do not know what to do." To say that one knows and to say   
that one does not know, both are the ego-games. That is why   
Bhagavan Ramana said in Upadesa Saram, Verse 27: That is True Knowledge which transcends   
Both knowledge and ignorance   
For in Pure Knowledge   
Is no object to be known.   
Once Major Chadwick, who had by then spent 2 years in Sri   
Ramanasramam, started feeling empty without any progress   
in sadhana. He felt that his vasanas were to high to eradicate   
and almost decided to go back to his country. He was in despair.   
One afternoon, in the hot T'malai weather, while he was moving   
the punkah for Bhagavan, he said: Bhagavan! I do not know I   
can further progress. I am not happy with my progress. I thought   
I would return to my country..... Bhagavan did not reply. He   
was continuing to read some newspaper or letter. Suddenly,   
He turned towards Major Chadwick and said: "You are telling   
I am not happy. You are telling I do not know how I can further   
progress. You are telling I want to go back to my country....   
Tell me who is saying all these? Who is this "I" which has come   
a number of times, in your crying? Please find out."   
Major Chadwick returned to his cottage. He had immense peace.   
For two or three days, he did not even go to the Hall. On the third   
day, while inside the bath-tub, he had 'understood'. He came   
running with his towel and told Bhagavan: "IS IT SO SIMPLE?"   
Bhagavan said: "IT IS.."   
Whenever the sadhak finds no progress and keep on telling I am   
not improving, I am not doing any effort to progress, if he intensely   
prays to his Guru, the grace which is even otherwise there, will   
start flowing more and more.   
Karunaiyal ennai anda nee enakku....(Sri Arunachala Padigam,   
Verse 1)

dear matthew   
our names are similar..my name is matthias thats the same in german like  
matthew in english..and Iam 23...   
first I like to say that questions like this are very welcome in forums like  
this, you know why? because some part in us likes to teach, and show what sort  
of "understanding" and even "realisation" we have, and hte best place to do  
this is under such a theme......Iam not different..so what I say is maybe  
totally stupid....   
but I try to be honest with you ok.. (I know what I will write may not make  
all people of htis forum happy, but anyway...)   
first I would say that you should not judge buddhism in such a way, it has a  
strong non-dual teaching at the core...so maybe you karma is just different  
and you met the wrong teachers? I practice vajrayana buddhism and my teachers  
where all fountains of love and nurturing presence...they still carry me today  
even If I met them just for one time...for some hours you know..the blessing  
is still with me.   
and why you do not think about a psychotherapy, I make one myself...its not  
forbidden for "spiritual" people....you see it hightens awereness...and thats  
what it is all about in the spiritual life or? you see freud was austrian (Iam  
too) and I understand why we in the west have something like  
psychotherapy...why it stepped into the realm of time here in the west?  
because we need it..and its a good thing. I dont say its for all people, but  
it is a good thing really especially for our generation...I feel like this is  
true for me..I may be wrong, but as I said I want to be honest with you....   
the questions you raise are qustions for a therapist not for a yogi...a yogi  
can also solve your problem of course, but maybe a therpasist would do it in a  
better way, or lets say in a more "western" way...   
I make a gestlatherapy and my therapist is budhdist too, and I found books of  
hte maharshi and paul brunton in his library, its wonderfull he helps me solve  
my worldy problems and sometimes we may touch also spiritual feelings during  
the therapy...he is not a spiritual teacher for me, of course, but you see  
sometimes there is a sort of touching point where meditaiton and therapy  
meet...   
to solve your worldy problems try out a therapy, it changed my life...faster  
and deeper then my meditation practice...Iam more happy, I have less fear of  
contact to others etc...all the worldy stuff you know...   
to solve your spiritual problems please go to the maharshi, he can solve  
everything...   
I know that in the end the maharshi will also solve all the worldy problems, I  
mean he will solve all problems, but for hte meantime, for your own happiness  
think about what I wrote   
if you are interessted here is a wiki-link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_therapy   
be guarded and have a safe journey   
matthias   
PS: matthias//matthew means "gift of god"...nice to know huh?

## I don't know what to do anymore  
Author: Matthew             Date: June 28, 2008, 08:20:20 PM

Hey,   
I'm a 26 year old male from Canada. I had a very safe, suburbanite, middle  
class upbringing. I went on to complete a degree in Psychology and have since  
spent most my time working in the various human services fields.   
I was a very normal, happy, social kid up until about grade seven. I had  
matured emotionally and intellectually a bit ahead of my peers and this  
created a divide. I became very reclusive, overweight, and indulgent in a  
haze that lasted for many years. While in University I finally lost the  
weight and started a new phase of my life.   
When I was about 13 I would buy books on psychology and I ended up getting one  
that included information on altered states of consciousness that fascinated  
me. I got more into altered states and that eventually lead me to Buddhism  
since many experiences people reported from altered states resonated well with  
the Buddhist experience. Even Papaji mentioned that some of the people he met  
who had tried psychedelics spoke statements that were indicative of glimpses  
into the things the scriptures speak of.   
Thankfully I didn't get stuck in Buddhism. Too much tradition and people  
imitating something without having the deep understanding for themselves.   
Eventually and thankfully I found my way to David Bohm and Krishnamurti, and  
then finally Ramana Maharshi, Nisargadatta Maharaj, and Papaji. Since finding  
those people nothing has resonated with me more.   
My practices or my interests have never been that serious. I live a deeply  
conflicted life with a gemini personality that often destroys whatever I build  
up. I have so many interests and so many things on the go but none of them I  
go far enough into. Something always pulls me back to this whole ayurvedic  
pursuit. It's always in my heart and in the back of my mind. Usually I am  
pursuing more worldly things though.   
I'm at a point where I find it extraordinarily difficult to relate to other  
people. My interests and theirs tend to be opposite. I come across as a very  
serious, non-fun kind of person to them, but when I fake being a fun person I  
never feel right and it never goes that well anyway. No one I meet ever  
understands me or listens or attends to me the way I do them. I am social and  
go to many events by myself but so rare do I meet anyone and usually after  
speaking with them for a few minutes I find nothing in them that resonates  
with me and vice versa. I've been in a few relationships lately that ended  
painfully because I chose a partner who seems to be very caring and unselfish  
but in the end mind dominates so much and I am not providing them with the  
kind of experience they want so it doesn't work out. But I cannot fake it, I  
cannot put in that effort to create a certain kind of experience for them  
apart from what comes naturally for me to do.   
I just don't know what to do anymore. I do want more friends, and I do want a  
partner again. Then there is part of me that is tempted to leave everything  
worldly behind and pursue only this one simple truth (the teachings of Ramana  
Maharshi).   
My professional experiences have been very unpleasant. Most the places I have  
worked at are considered good, fun places to work at by most people, but for  
me it's horrible. The lack of intelligence, the lack of a deep concern for  
the well being of all of us, the inattention that is promoted and fostered,  
the conditioning and brainwashing to certain beliefs that are held, etc.   
I go to some of the Buddhist groups locally, and there they speak the exact  
opposite of Advaita. They talk about the constant effort you have to put in  
because it's easy to bad things but hard to do good ones. They talk about how  
you have to mediate to reach the highest level of meditation. Even though the  
monk has been meditating for 40 years he wants more time to do all this. He  
wants us all to accept slow, gradual progress in time to move towards a goal  
that apparently none of the Buddhists really reach or maybe 1 every 1000  
years. They talk about being able to fly, read other people's minds, and walk  
on water as benchmarks of being enlightened... I just want to understand  
myself and be happy.   
What to do, what to do. I'm just frustrated and depressed. Thank you for  
taking the time to listen -- I am hoping here is a place with people who can  
understand and relate. Feel free to make any comments; I'd be happy to hear  
anything.

Dear Matthew, I will say that you ended up well with Ramana Maharshi.   
Read His books. To know what is happening at a distant place or to   
know other people's mind or to know past, present and future, is   
not enlightenment. Bhagavan says that to stay in the Self is the   
real wisdom-insight and not these three things. Eat simple vegetarian food.  
Being in West, do not resort to drugs for enlightenment. These   
will not confer enlightenment. Be friendly and compassionate to poeple   
but do not interfere with their lives or any other worldly matters. If   
you are distraught, ask for Bhagavan Ramana's Grace. It is flowing   
perennially but you should 'seek' it. Bhagavan's cinema-screen   
example is excellent. Be a screen, a witness. When the show is   
over, only screen remains as a silvery brilliance and you will hear   
a low monotone of Ramana which will be with you always. There   
is no need to go away from society or embrace ascetism or shirk your   
regular work. These things can go hand in hand with self-enquiry.   
Ultimately the screen will remain for ever and you in the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.

I have read several books containing Ramana's words.   
I've read many more books by Krishnamurti, Papaji, Bohm, and Nisargadatta.   
The part I'm having the hardest time with is regarding my worldly pursuits and  
desire for friendship and relationships.   
Can I have it all, can I pursue both a worldly life and understanding the self  
at the same time, or does the worldly have to be put aside until one is steady  
enough in their awareness of the ever present self?   
My desire for the worldly life is very strong so suppressing it would not be  
easy or perhaps even directly possible.

Dear Mathew   
With people like Subramanian and nonduel and others i am whole heap immature  
to comment.But still i am making an effort.   
You are frustrated want to leave everything becoz you are not getting what you  
want. The root cause is the desire to have friends, partner etc which you  
think would give you happiness/pleasure. But is it true??   
 **The purpose of life for all beings is to achieve continuous permanent  
happines unadulterated or unmixed with sorrows and sufferings.** Since, you  
have already experienced so much of unhappiness in worldly life hence it  
proves that having friend, partner, or money is not the source of permanent  
happiness/satisfaction.   
For small small happiness/ pleasures people work so hard but where lies the  
permanent happiness/pleasure, we dont want to put at all any efforts.   
Dont leave World for Lord just becoz everybody or scripture says so. Just  
THINK!   
Its all a matter of choice. Its all in MIND. the happiness, the sorrows, these  
all are mind's play.   
I would like to illustrate a small story here: There were two friends namely Max & Sam of the same village. They both decided  
to go to foreign and earn some good money. Both went and started earning money  
there. Initially they communicated with their parents and gave them their  
address and all. After some time, the parents of both the boys got no  
communication from them and were quite worried. somebody from their village  
was going to the very same country and hence they asked him to visit their son  
also. The man went to that country and tried searching for the boys. After  
some effort he met Max who had become quite wealthy and was very happy. He  
enquired about Sam to which Max told that he died after 6 months only.   
After reaching back to his village, he got confused between Max and Sam. He  
could not remember who had died and who is alive. Hence, he told to Sam's  
parents that your son is doing very well, he is happy and very wealthy. The  
parents got very happy and started celebrating. On the other hand, he told to  
Max parents that your son has demised and the parents were devastated.   
In reality, the Max was alive and Sam was dead. But see the reaction of the  
parents!!   
So buddy its all in MIND. The sorrows and the happiness...   
Dont struggle hard to avoid sorrows and to get happiness. The sorrows are  
dirty/bumpy roads and the happiness are good roads of life. Tighten your hold  
on the steering which is Mind and put the gear of Lord's name. You will  
eventually reach to your Destination.   
OM!

Dear Matthew, adding to what Shivani has already covered,   
Bhagavan has said going to work, for minimum worldly comforts, like some  
money for simple vegetarian food, a shelter, clothes do not   
come in the way of your pursuing Wisdom. One need not go to   
a lonely island or jungle to pursue Wisdom. One can live in this   
world among people and can still do that. One should not direct noisy   
his mind in unncessary worldly matters or in other people's jobs.   
One can live anywhere, if he could control his mind. Similarly,   
one need not separately allot time for meditation. Meditation can   
be the underlying montone in your work-situation. Arunachala Siva.

Hey Matthew, hang in there Buddy. Don't despair you are on the right track. I  
was in a somewhat similar place in the 60's. In my case it was the fear of  
death that seized me and put me into that awful place. I came up with a way to  
push this fear aside so that I could function. Read about a guy named Eckhart  
Tolle who went thru your experience and came out of it fully realized and  
filled with joy. Sane thing happened to me. Fortunately a guy I encountered  
handed me a copy of "Who Am I" which was like looking at a map of where I had  
been. It seems the only way to heaven on earth is thru the gates of hell.  
Ramana went that way, Budha went that way and it seems J. C. also. 40 days in  
the desert, a form of hell for him. Zen gives a person a riddle that drives  
them to a state of despair that will put them in that place where heaven and  
hell meet. It has been almost 40 years since my experience and I checked out  
everything related to the subject and I always return to Maharshi as the  
purest way. Even checked out a guy named Spinoza who stated that god was every  
where and was the universal substate of the world. Maharshi recommended  
staying fully involved with the world and he was right as the world for me is  
endleesly fascinating and joyful. I say read "Who Am I" then st down and  
realize that you are not your mind, you are the I of the I and I think that  
will work.   
By the way my name is Dave Mahar and it is coincedence that the name is  
similar to Maharshi.   
I just thought of another interesting person. A Lady by the name of Byron  
Katie. Check out her and Eckhart Tolle, they both have websites and both are  
charging substancial fees to come and kisten to their lectures. I can't  
imagine what they have to say as from my point of view "The Tao that can be  
described is not the Tao".

Dear Matthew, As Davemahar said, fear of death is the primordial fear,   
from where every other fear sprouts. Here again, fear of death only is fear  
and not death by itself. Fear of death is fear of losing something known to  
you, the body, the senses, the mind et al. Please read 'Who am I?' and   
that is more than sufficient. You can read Zen Buddhism, Bible and whole   
range of western philosophy -- from Francis Bacon to Kant, Spinoza,  
Shophenheur, Nietszhe and Bertrand Russel. In my case, at least, all these  
readings only confused me. A little bit of Sankara and then Bhagavan Ramana  
Maharshi will do. Good luck.   
Arunachala Siva.

Buddhism is a jungle. Once you step in, it is difficult to find which way you  
should go.   
Unless you are born in Buddhism tradition, I do not recommend you to go into  
Buddhism.   
Many Buddhism schools, which are active in America and Europe,   
teach strange teachings which have nothing to do with orthodox Buddhism.   
I think it is good to stick to Bhagavan Ramana only.   
His teaching is simple and clear.   
You have little chance to go astray.   
And forget Poonja(Papaji) and Nisargadatta (in my opinion).   
I see a problem here.   
A man who compiled a famous book on Bhagavan Ramana also wrote on Poonja and  
Nisargadatta.   
So some people could automatically accept Poonja and Nisargadatta as good  
gurus as Bhagavan Ramana.   
You have to think carefully with your common sense   
and judge whether they speak truth or they just try to spin your head with  
nonsense.   
This is only my opinion.

Nisarga Datta Maharaj and Papaji must have said the same thing as Bhagavan  
Ramana.   
But their teachings confuse me. I am more at home with Bhagavan Ramana.  
Perhaps,   
the tuning up, differs from person to person. The Guru, if you lead your life  
as the   
way he had said or shown, never forsakes the devotee/disciple. It like a fawn  
caught   
in the tiger's jaw.

If someone goes to Bhagavan Ramana and says: I do not know   
what to do," He would ask: "Find out this "I", which is telling,   
"I do not know what to do." To say that one knows and to say   
that one does not know, both are the ego-games. That is why   
Bhagavan Ramana said in Upadesa Saram, Verse 27: That is True Knowledge which transcends   
Both knowledge and ignorance   
For in Pure Knowledge   
Is no object to be known.   
Once Major Chadwick, who had by then spent 2 years in Sri   
Ramanasramam, started feeling empty without any progress   
in sadhana. He felt that his vasanas were to high to eradicate   
and almost decided to go back to his country. He was in despair.   
One afternoon, in the hot T'malai weather, while he was moving   
the punkah for Bhagavan, he said: Bhagavan! I do not know I   
can further progress. I am not happy with my progress. I thought   
I would return to my country..... Bhagavan did not reply. He   
was continuing to read some newspaper or letter. Suddenly,   
He turned towards Major Chadwick and said: "You are telling   
I am not happy. You are telling I do not know how I can further   
progress. You are telling I want to go back to my country....   
Tell me who is saying all these? Who is this "I" which has come   
a number of times, in your crying? Please find out."   
Major Chadwick returned to his cottage. He had immense peace.   
For two or three days, he did not even go to the Hall. On the third   
day, while inside the bath-tub, he had 'understood'. He came   
running with his towel and told Bhagavan: "IS IT SO SIMPLE?"   
Bhagavan said: "IT IS.."   
Whenever the sadhak finds no progress and keep on telling I am   
not improving, I am not doing any effort to progress, if he intensely   
prays to his Guru, the grace which is even otherwise there, will   
start flowing more and more.   
Karunaiyal ennai anda nee enakku....(Sri Arunachala Padigam,   
Verse 1)   
Arunachala Siva.

dear matthew   
our names are similar..my name is matthias thats the same in german like  
matthew in english..and Iam 23...   
first I like to say that questions like this are very welcome in forums like  
this, you know why? because some part in us likes to teach, and show what sort  
of "understanding" and even "realisation" we have, and hte best place to do  
this is under such a theme......Iam not different..so what I say is maybe  
totally stupid....   
but I try to be honest with you ok.. (I know what I will write may not make  
all people of htis forum happy, but anyway...)   
first I would say that you should not judge buddhism in such a way, it has a  
strong non-dual teaching at the core...so maybe you karma is just different  
and you met the wrong teachers? I practice vajrayana buddhism and my teachers  
where all fountains of love and nurturing presence...they still carry me today  
even If I met them just for one time...for some hours you know..the blessing  
is still with me.   
and why you do not think about a psychotherapy, I make one myself...its not  
forbidden for "spiritual" people....you see it hightens awereness...and thats  
what it is all about in the spiritual life or? you see freud was austrian (Iam  
too) and I understand why we in the west have something like  
psychotherapy...why it stepped into the realm of time here in the west?  
because we need it..and its a good thing. I dont say its for all people, but  
it is a good thing really especially for our generation...I feel like this is  
true for me..I may be wrong, but as I said I want to be honest with you....   
the questions you raise are qustions for a therapist not for a yogi...a yogi  
can also solve your problem of course, but maybe a therpasist would do it in a  
better way, or lets say in a more "western" way...   
I make a gestlatherapy and my therapist is budhdist too, and I found books of  
hte maharshi and paul brunton in his library, its wonderfull he helps me solve  
my worldy problems and sometimes we may touch also spiritual feelings during  
the therapy...he is not a spiritual teacher for me, of course, but you see  
sometimes there is a sort of touching point where meditaiton and therapy  
meet...   
to solve your worldy problems try out a therapy, it changed my life...faster  
and deeper then my meditation practice...Iam more happy, I have less fear of  
contact to others etc...all the worldy stuff you know...   
to solve your spiritual problems please go to the maharshi, he can solve  
everything...   
I know that in the end the maharshi will also solve all the worldy problems, I  
mean he will solve all problems, but for hte meantime, for your own happiness  
think about what I wrote   
if you are interessted here is a wiki-link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_therapy   
be guarded and have a safe journey   
matthias   
PS: matthias//matthew means "gift of god"...nice to know huh?
