## Does incense help meditation?

Do you use incense when you meditate?   
I started to use incense since I was in Tiruvannamalai.   
I think it helps to make mind pure in meditation.   
Does Bhagavan ever speak something about the effect of incense?

Dear Akira,   
Bhagavan Ramana did not say anything specifically about incense   
helping meditation. However, the standard incense made from   
sandal powder, which is sattvic, brings about a sattvic disposition   
in the mind. Sandal paste is applied to gods, after abulations.   
Sandal paste water is also used for abulations. In Hindu elite   
society of the olden times, males used to apply sandal paste,   
after a good dinner during festivals. Sandal is sattvic. Not the   
chemicals which also give identical smell.   
Arunachala Siva.

For all mangal karyam we use sandal. During marriage it plays a vital role  
while inviting people. It gives pleasing feelings. I think as we live in  
tropical country   
our elders might have thought to use sandal for cooling agent during summer  
time. People in south when they shave their head for kids and elders while  
they visit temples they   
apply sandle paste to cool their head. And whatever is good for us, we used to  
offer to gods also. It helps for meditation also. But we should not depend on  
incense sticks   
for meditation means it should not come as a habit. It is good in the  
beginning that what I was told.

Dear Subramanian and ramanaduli,   
thank you for explaining Indian customs about sandal.   
Sandal incense is used here in Buddhist temples too.   
The smell of sandal makes mind ready for meditation,   
just like smell of sambar makes mind ready for lunch.

Dear Akira,   
Nice example of Sambhar. In the ancient days, it was believed that   
a chaste woman's lock of hairs will have the natural fragrance without jasmine  
and good hair oil! A Pandya King had a doubt about this aspect when he smelt  
the fragrance of his wife's lock of hairs when the latter was drying it up in  
the terrace of the palace where the former was just strolling. He asked his  
ministers and pandits.   
No one could answer. Then he announced it to his subjects to   
tell the satisfying answer with a prize of 1000 gold coins. There   
was one poor priest in Madurai temple and he had no money for   
his wedding and family life. He prayed to Lord Sundareswara.   
The Lord appeared before him and gave him a poem and asked   
him to read in the court so that the king would be happy and give   
away the prize! The poem said: The chaste woman will have   
natural fragarance in her lock of hairs and that is the proof of her   
chastity! The priest, who was not a poet, his name was Dharumi   
went to the court and read out the poem. The king was pleased   
and he was about to give away the prize. The head poet Nakkirar,   
objected. And asked questions to the priest. He fumbled and   
eventually said that the Lord gave him the poem. Suddenly the   
Lord, Siva appeared in the court in the guise of a poet. And asked   
why the doubt? Nakkirar said no woman however chaste she is   
would have natural fragrance. Siva asked: Even your wife? Yes, even my  
wife. The queen? Yes, even the queen. Your god Siva's wife Parvati? Yes,  
even Parvati. Siva got angry and opened His third eye. Nakkirar got  
immeditely burning sensation all over his body and cried. Then Siva appeared  
before him in his real form and told him to go and do penance in the nearby  
village pond, called Pazhamudir Solai. Nakkirar rushed their and did penance.  
One bhoota, appeared before him and did a trick. One yellow leaf fell from  
the tree near the pond. Half of the leaf had touched the waters and became a  
dove. The half fell on the banks and became another dove. Both fought and  
made love. Nakkirar's penace was disturbed. The bhoota took him away and  
placed him in a prison for ultimate consumption! Nakkirar became miserable.  
Siva then appeared before him and said: Now, instead of Dharumi's one small  
poem, chant a long extempore poem on my son, Skanda. He then composed the  
long poem of 300+ lines on Muruga's six abodes. This is the famous Tiru  
Murugatrupadai, one of the oldest poems on Muruga, in Tamil composed in 2nd  
Century A.D!   
Bhoota - a heavenly appearance, like an angel, but ferocious.   
Arunachala Siva.

Somebody says Tamil is older language than Sanskirt.   
Little people know that Tamil and Japanese language (my mother language) are  
quite similar.   
Tamil and Japanese are in the same language groupe.   
In pre-historic age, South Indian people must have come to Japan and settled  
down.   
We have still similar tradition like Pongal.

Yes. It is true. Tamil is an oldest language. The history says even God like  
Siva and kartikeya comes on earth to listen tamil poems. The sage Agasthiya  
wrote tamil grammer. We have all sciences in tamil. There are lots of sages  
who wrote poems on lords and advaita. The true lover of tamil will accept God  
and enlightenment. All oldest works talks about the atma and paramatma and how  
to get salvation.

I thought bad smell can help!   
when there is bad smell u see lots of conflicts in ur mind!   
when u can see that that conflict is not you   
u would realize!   
that is why most of the ashrams have their meditation halls in stinking state!   
no ventilation right. .. so its stinking and when u sit there, if there are  
misquitos or bugs it would be better suited for meditation. .. u see

Have you set up Tamil fonts, ramanaduli?

Dear Akira,   
Tamil is the second oldest language, next to Sanskrit, amongst   
the Indo-European languages. Tamil spread to Malaysia, Singapore,   
Burma, and Kampuchea as per the researchers, since some Tamil   
kings went by boat for expedition to these countries. The Angor Vot   
scultpures of Kampuchea show Vishnu, Siva and Buddha. There is   
an white elephant which is the vehicle of Indra. Buddha also is said   
have travelled in a white elephant when he attained Maha Nirvana.   
Perhaps, the influence also spread to Japan, I am not sure.   
Arunachala Siva.
