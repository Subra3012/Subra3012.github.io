## Self-Not Self

My body sits, stands, plays, eats, walks, runs, drinks, etc., but I say I  
sit, stand, play,eat, walk, run, drink, etc.   
 My body-mind complex thinks, writes, talks, speaks etc., but I say I think,  
write, talk, speak, etc.   
 Who Am I ?   
 Bhagwan Sri Ramana says that the 'Self', that is 'Aham' or 'I' is quite  
different from the three bodies i.e.   
 gross, mental, and astral which are 'Not-Self'. It is because of ignorance  
that the 'sense of Self '   
 or the 'I-Notion' is erroneously foisted on that which is 'Not-Self'.And this  
is the bondage or Hriday-Jada   
 Granthi as this is generally known.This erroneous foisting of Self on the  
Not-Self is the genesis of all the   
 troubles.Since this Granthi arises due to ignorance only, knowledge ensues  
Light, and knowledge of one's   
 own Self.To know thus from the Guru is the Sravana.   
 Sri Bhagwan says that after Sravana, contemplating deeply and discovering  
through subtle 'Enquiry'   
 of 'Who Am I ?' that which is different from the three bodies and exists  
Single and Universal   
 in the 'Heart' as 'Aham' or 'I' is Manana. Sri Bhagwan says that this 'I' is  
denoted by tvam in the Scriptural   
 Mahavakya 'Tat tvam asi' (That thou art) as delicately as a stalk of grass is  
drawn from its sheath.   
 And this leads to Samadhi.

Except Self, all are 'Not-Self in the whole universe and beyond. Only Self is  
real and 'Not-Self is mere thought   
 and, therefore, imagined. Not-Self shines forth in association with Self  
only.Not otherwise. Self is Self-luminous   
 It does not require association of Not-Self to Shine forth.   
 Ego which experiances the Not-Self comes up only holding the Self. If Self  
is held, ego vanishes.   
 Until then, Sri Bhagwan says, the Sage will be saying, "There Is " and the  
ignorant will be asking, " Where ? ".

From Eight Stanzas to Sri Arunachala,   
 Verse No 6,   
 "Thou art Thyself the one being, ever aware as the Self-luminous Heart ! In  
Thee there is a mysterious   
 power (Shakti) which without Thee is nothing. From it proceeds the phantom of the mind emitting its latent   
 subtle dark mists, wwhich illumined by Thy Light (of consciousness) reflected on them, appear within as thoughts   
 whirling in the vortices of prarabdha, later developing into the psychic worlds and projected outwardly   
 as the material world transformed in the concrete objects which are magnified by the outgoing senses   
 and move about like pictures in a cinema show.Visible or Invisible, Oh Hill Grace, without Thee they are   
 nothing !"

Bhagwan Sri Ramana has Himself elaborated upon the Verse No 6 from the 'Eight  
Stanzas to Sri Arunachala in Talk No 323. Sri Bhagwan says that ego is the  
product of second reflection of the 'Light of Self. First, Light of Self   
 gets diffused through the Original Darkness or the Original Sin. The Light  
passing through it is called thhe 'Reflected Light' and known on its own  
merits as the Pure Mind or Ishwara, or God. In other words, this 'Reflected  
Light is Ishwara. But Sri Bhagwan says that Pure Mind implies the impure mind  
also.This impure mind is projected from the former Pure Mind or Satvic Mind  
through second reflectoin of the Light of Self from the aggregate of  
tendencies or samskaras and that is the rise of the spurious ego.Thus, ego is  
the product of the second darkness. Sri Bhagwan says that ego is the Rajasic  
mind and Tamasic or the dull mind appear as the world.Thus, Shakti or Maya or  
Mind's sublime original activity (i.e.Power vibrating),Satwa filled reflection  
results; from it the rajasic ego; then tamasic thought-forms and the world.   
 Sri Bhagwan says that in as much as we think that this ego or I-thought  
witnesses all other objects in the   
 waking and dream states, it should be considered the subject. However, on  
realising the Pure Self, it along with   
 the external world are objects only- only 'Not-Self'.
