As advised by Nanasaheb Chandorkar his wife used to do Naam-Jap regularly.  
Once when She was sitting near Sai Baba in Shirdi, He said, "My mother you  
grind a lot of grains, but the outcome is useless."   
Sai Baba was referring to the chanting or remembrance of God's name in a  
mechanical way. When the name is chanted, sung or remembered, it should have  
the feeling of love, bhava, with it. When we call our near and dear ones,  
there is an element of love in that, when we call a complete stranger on the  
road it is different,than a mother calls her little child. So the name of God,  
chanted or remembered, without any love or feeling is useless.   
Baba (Shirdi Sai Baba) jokingly used to say to Nana, "Nana, amongst all these  
people, there is not even a single swan? There are just crows!"   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
Very good. Chanting God's name mechanically is a waste of time. It will simply  
fill the mind with thoughts.   
But chanting God's name with deep devotion has quite a different effect.   
It was possibly Sri Ramakrishna who said: Looking at a still pond there does not seem to be any life in it.   
But sprinkling some puffed rice in the pond we see fishes coming out suddenly  
from within.   
Same with Nama which acts like a puffed rice which will bring out the "fishes"  
from within out heart.

Kali is Mahaa Maayaa unleashed. She did not even care about her husband.   
Mahaa Maayaa will become peaceful only if you surrender to her. Then   
she will show her soumya form, nice beautiful, calm form, as the cute   
wife of Siva. Sri Sankara says: "Who can measure Maayaa's tricks? In a   
few seconds, like the ball falling down from the stairs, one sadhak can   
fall in seconds, if she does not show concern for you." It is like the story   
of Bilwa Mangal, the author of Sri Krishna Karnamrutam. He was a compulsive  
sex monger, who climbed to the upper storey of his lover's   
house, holding a snake as a rope. He had earlier crossed the stream on   
a crocodile. Maayaa will do anything to befall you. Surrender to her.   
That is why Sri Sankara composed his famous Sri Devi Kshamaparadana   
Stotram.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanianji,   
If you read my post, I have not said the witness "stops watching movie", I  
said that the witness recognizes that he is the witness and not the part of  
the movie.   
Love!

Dear Subramanianji & Raju,   
Anyways, i am not 100% sure here. Coz, i myself did not have nirvikalpa  
samadhi.   
Only someone who had it can speak.   
Ashtavakra Samhita says: The seer is without thoughts even when thinking, without senses among the  
senses, without understanding even in understanding and without a sense of  
responsibility even in the ego. 18.95   
Again it says. ..   
For me established in my own glory, there is no self or non-self, no good or  
evil, no thought or even absence of thought. 19.4   
Love!   
Silence

Dear Raju and srkudai, all this drama occurs because of chit-jada   
granthi, the self-body complex. When we say, mano-nasa, it is   
not 'killing the mind', because 'mind' has not got any 'physical   
entity' for killing. It is 'leaving' the mind, or resolving the mind,   
once for all and staying in the Self. Whenever we think of   
something, while watching a TV story or a cinema, and in the process, miss a  
scene in TV or cinema, we say that 'mind has gone somewhere.   
In other words, mind has left the scene. Again, Raju, it is only   
with the mind, the mind can be 'killed ' or left for good.   
As Bhagavan says, it is like a stick that is used to stir the funeral   
pyre, and after the work is over, the stick is also burnt on the pyre.   
(Who am I?).   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 Thats perfectly correct.   
By a pure mind, i understand a mind where "I" points to Self and not body or  
mind.   
So such a mind does not load the physical or mental problems on the Self.   
So Someone calls me an idiot; the idea he thinks i am an idiot comes in  
mind : but since i no more think I am the mental "I", this thought fails to  
affect me. If i am present as a mental entity, then this thought affects.   
Love!

Dear srkudai, You said it. In retrospect, I think, Bhagavan   
said this "Suddha manas" concept for two reasons. One is   
to clarify the doubt of the seekers, as how can Bhagavan do   
all the work in this world, without mind. Second, many of us are damn afraid  
of mano-nasa, thinking that we would then go mad! Bhagavan   
said: All right, do not be afraid, have a Suddha manas. This reminds   
me of a story in management. A person had a monkey, hung   
permanently around his neck and the knot was so tight that   
no one could untie it. One doctor said: All right, I shall sedate   
you, so that the monkey will not trouble you and he was put   
on sedation. Another came and said: No I shall not sedate you,   
I shall sedate the monkey, and the monkey was sedated so that   
it could not trouble that man. After sometime, nothing worked.   
Then one another doctor came and said: It is simple, I shall   
untie the knot; he untied it, with some difficulty and both the   
man and the monkey became peaceful. After some time,   
the man came again! I am so much used to monkey and now I am   
not able to live without the monkey! Then the doctor said: All right, I shall paint a monkey on your chest! You can always   
"feel" that the monkey is ever with you. He did the painting,   
and the man became peaceful without any further problem.   
The painted monkey, is perhaps, the Suddha manas!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju, in spiritual game, every one is a winner, because   
everyone gets gold medal, that is Light. There is no silver and   
bronze here.   
Dear srkduai, the when the person who is an audience in the   
movie, becomes the Witness, it does not matter, whether the   
play stops or not. If by inter galactic wars, all the universe   
perishes, even then Brahman is a Witness, though the 'play'   
has stopped. At that time, the 'maha-maya' curls up into the   
Brahman. Or Sakti is united with Siva, till the next play starts,   
for her to do her mischief.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, Hari means one who is green in colour. It   
means Narayana or Vishnu. Hara means who who dissolves   
or destroys. It means Siva. Hara does dissolve, not only the   
life but also the ego or mind. Other words, I do not known
