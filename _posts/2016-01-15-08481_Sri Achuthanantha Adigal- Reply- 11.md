On the eleventh day, a Wednesday afternoon at three O'clock, he called another  
disciple, Sri   
Mandiramoorthy Pillai, a Siddha doctor, and told him about some rare medicinal  
systems. He   
completed the Sanmarkka Darpanam that the same day late in the night, at three  
a.m. and   
commanded his disciple, Sri Vaithilingam Pillai, 'Sir! Print this book and  
distribute it.' Soon after   
4 am. he felt unwell and Sri Mandiramoorthi Pillai, who was among those  
nearby, said that he   
would provide the necessary treatment. Achuthananda Swamigal smiled and said,  
'Dhanvantri!   
My time is up. The body is waiting to fall off. What can you do?' Then he  
went to the nearby river   
Naganadhi and took his bath. On his way back he stopped for a while at an  
open space near where   
he was staying and told himself, 'It seems, all that is to happen further will  
happen here', and returned   
home.   
Later, Achutananda Swamigal drank some liquid food, made all his disciples sit  
before him and   
explained clearly to them the ephemeral nature of the body, advising them not  
to waste life but   
to utilize it for practicing samadhi. At that time, one of his very close  
disciples and his sister-in-law's   
son, named Muthukrishna Naidu, came, prostrated and requested him to come back  
to Kasthambadi.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
