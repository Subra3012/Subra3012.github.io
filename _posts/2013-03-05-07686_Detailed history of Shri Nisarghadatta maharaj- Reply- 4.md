Dear Sri ksksat27,   
Yes,Sri Ranjit Maharaj was indeed true jnani. His teaching is very simple and  
yet,very profound. He is so dear.   
Dear Sri Atmavichar,   
Thank You Very much for the link! Yes,"The way of the bird" is the teching of  
Sri Siddharameshwar Maharaj,the Guru of Sri Ranjit and Sri Nisargadatta  
Maharaj,who is the head of the Inchegiri branch of the Navnath Sampradaya(Nine  
Masters).   
Here is the explanation of the teaching from wikipedia: " It is the 'direct way' of knowing the Final Reality, in which one becomes  
aware of one's original nature through mental discrimination, a method which  
is common to the teachers of theNavnath Sampradaya   
.   
 This mental discrimination or the Bird's way ('Vihangam Marg') was also  
presented by Nisargadatta's co-disciple, Ranjit Maharaj; wherein Self-  
Knowledge is gained just as a bird flying in the sky goes easily from branch  
to branch, instead of slowly crawling its way up the tree like an ant, as in  
the 'Pipilika Marg'. Here the disciple reaches straight to truth, without  
wasting time in long drawn out practices that would take him to the 'fruit' no  
doubt, only slowly. He proposed to use one's mental faculty to break from the  
unreal to the real, and the mind's false identification with the ego, simply  
by listening to and constantly thinking over what the master has said, and  
knowing that "You are already That".[19]   
The common teaching style of teaching of the Inchgiri Sampradaya masters  
(beginning with Shri Bhauseheb Maharaj) to Indian devotees was for the Master  
to select a passage from a traditional text on Advaita Vedanta, most  
commonlyDasbodh   
 of Saint Shri Samarth Ramdas   
(as well as the "Yoga Vasishtha", "Saachara" of Shri Shankaracharya, and the  
"Ecknati Bhagwat" of Saint Ecknath), and to expound upon the meaning and  
import of that selected passage. Nisargadatta Maharaj and Ranjit Maharaj both  
deviated from this formal format by giving informal discourses for the benefit  
of western devotees who did not have access to Dasbodh or the other texts, and  
who were not familiar with Indian traditions and customs."
