Further, the overlapping of the words, the ideas, and the intended object, are  
no longer there,   
the trio of the observer, observation. and the observed, being simultaneously  
lit by the light of   
Purusha, whereby one is able to understand everything in the phenomenal world,  
seeing in one   
stroke the past, present and future. Since here the duality or the interval  
between buddhi and the self   
is also removed,no discrete experience of the senses is possible.   
The subsequent chapter,known as Vibhuti Pada expatiates upon various  
thamaturgical powers   
that the Yogi comes upon, which albeit not relevant to the enlightenment, are  
a pointer towards   
the mastery obtained by the Yogi over the entire existence. These are not  
equated with the cheap   
tricks pursued only by some "soi disant" or self styled swamis to gull the  
unwary public.   
The last chapter Kaivalya Pada contains a vivid description of the state of  
freedom of the spirit   
which is not adventitious, but essential.   
Thus Yoga is reading the book of life, to borrow an expression from  
Krishnamurti, here there   
being no reader, the reading also not not being one of page after page, but in  
one stroke free   
of time.   
concluded.   
Arunachala Siva.
