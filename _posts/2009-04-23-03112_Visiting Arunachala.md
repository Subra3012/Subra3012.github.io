Dear karthikeyan. M   
In Arunachala, apart from Sri Ramanasramam, Arunachaleswara-   
Apeetakuchamba Temple, you can visit the following places if   
you find extra time: 1\. Sri Seshadri Swami Asramam, about 200 metres from Sri   
Ramanasramam.   
2\. Sri Yogi Ramsurat Kumar Ashram, about 500 metres from   
Sri Ramanasramam.   
3\. Pachiamman Koil, about 2 kms from Asramam.*   
4\. Guru Murtham, about 3 kms from Asramam.*   
(*These are the places where Bhagavan Ramana stayed sometime   
or other)   
5\. Isanya Desikar Math, in the road route of girivalam. Here Bhagavan Ramana  
was fed one day by that Head of Math, in   
early years.   
6\. Tirukovilur, where there is a beautiful Narayana Temple. This   
is about 40 kms. Here Narayana is Trivikrama, the one who measured the earth  
and sky for Mahabali.   
7\. Polur, about 40 kms again, where there is a Math for Mastan   
Swami, a fully realized Muslim devotee of Bhagavan Ramana.   
Arunachala Siva.
