I live in the area of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and am interested in meeting  
with others in the area with an interest in studying, discussing, and  
practicing the teachings of Bhagavan in a small group setting.

## The future of God and science By Deepak Chopra  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: February 05, 2012, 02:41:41 PM

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/spirituality/science-of-  
spirituality/The-future-of-God-and-science/articleshow/11683544.cms   
Guest editor Deepak Chopra on why God's future depends upon science, and vice  
versa - and why sages and scientists should meet.   
Which is more important in shaping your future, science or spirituality? For  
some this may sound like an empty question. Science has shaped our age;  
religion is a declining force in the West, as it has been for decades. A clock  
could be placed behind every pulpit, ticking off the thousands of people who  
leave organised faith behind, every hour of the day. But there is a growing  
movement that is repairing the rift between science and religion. It has  
nothing to do with the noisy band of atheists who continue to foment discord  
between faith and reason. Rather, science has reached a point where certain  
basic mysteries cannot be solved without resorting to the one thing that  
spirituality has always specialised in: consciousness.   
Science is dominated by materialism, a worldview that traces all activity,  
including our imagination and creativity, to physical processes in the brain,  
and these processes are either chemically determined or random, depending on  
which strain of materialism you confront. Spirituality, which is much broader  
than religion, is based on the assumption that a transcendent reality exists  
beyond the physical world. This is the domain of higher consciousness, or if  
you are conventionally minded, the home of the soul and God.   
To find a common ground could be difficult but one can try. The annual Sages  
and Scientists Symposium organised by the Chopra Foundation seeks to do just  
that by bringing together philosophers and scientists who are sympathetic with  
the search for a single reality that embraces science and wisdom. The  
worldwide financial meltdown is matched by a cultural pandemic of confusion  
and a desperate search for deeper values. A groundswell of knowledge and  
insight has been building. Its shared message is this: There is something  
else, a dimension of reality beyond the material world. Beyond us, but in our  
midst.   
Scientists who are willing to venture into speculative thinking, joined by  
sages from the world's wisdom traditions, who are willing to look beyond  
arguments about God, face the same primal questions. Where did the universe  
come from? What preceded the Big Bang, before there was either "where" or  
"when"? A century after the quantum revolution in Physics, science has to face  
up to the vanishing act that the physical universe pulled, as matter and  
energy were both seen to emerge from a timeless state that is either an empty  
void (which no one accepts) or a field of infinite possibilities, a veritable  
womb of creation (which almost everyone is beginning to accept, however  
offended science may be by learning that the world's ancient sages and  
spiritual teachers knew about this timeless domain long before Physics arrived  
with its exact measuring devices).   
The reason that your future and mine depends on the settling of these  
questions isn't what you might think. Science can proceed perfectly well in  
everyday affairs without thinking about "metaphysics," as materialists like to  
call spirituality. For its part, spirituality can keep appealing to  
individuals, one at a time as they arrive at personal crises, revelations, and  
awakenings. But what will be shortchanged is reality. Ultimately, worldviews  
are secondary. If X believes in Buddha and Y in thermodynamics, their two  
worlds can sit uneasily next to each other or simply not interact. But reality  
is a shared concern. It's also a topic we can't afford to leave to  
specialists. Where the cosmos came from means a great deal, because the answer  
will tell you where the human mind came from, and where it's going.   
Is the universe conscious? If so, then our minds are embedded in the cosmic  
mind. Is the universe evolving? If so, that casts human evolution in a new  
light, along with the origin of life. These are not specialist questions. They  
go to the heart of the human condition.   
Our intention is not to pigeonhole anyone as sage or scientist or to join a  
camp for ideological reasons. There is a struggle going on between science and  
spirituality that will shape everyone's future, and if we each decide to join  
in, a blending may occur with magical consequences. What could be more  
fascinating? Together a complete engagement of the human faculties promises a  
more powerful and realistic basis for humanity's next evolutionary leap. The  
third international symposium of sages and scientists will be held at La Costa  
Resort & Spa, Carlsbad, California, March 3-5, 2012.

## Topic: Musings...  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: February 05, 2012, 10:51:45 AM  
---  
This post was prompted by a simple question asked by Swayam in the topic  
http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/forum/index.php?topic=6418.msg24676#msg24676  
and the responses thereof. On some contemplation, i came about with my musings  
as follows -   
Knowledge alone relieves. Stopping a thought process ain't going to help  
really! We could use all our manly efforts with deep fervor to stop some  
thought pattern without really understanding it, but, eventually, we will only  
cause damage to ourselves.   
The way to go about is proper scrutinisation and proper understanding of  
everything. Krishna's famous revelation in the Bhagavad Gita, that we have  
right to only act and not on its fruits, and, that it is best to dedicate the  
fruits to God, is not some proverb or diktat. It ought to be properly  
understood and only then it makes sense. Otherwise, it becomes like what  
happened in Russia. The banned The Bhagavad Gita. I do not blame them. Their  
worry is true. They felt that Bhagavad Gita encourages fighting for Krishna  
asked Arjuna to fight  They are true, but we without properly understanding  
are blindly believing Krishna, Ramana, Ramakrishna without proper  
discernments.   
There is no possibility of surrendering the fruits to God without proper  
understanding. It only amounts to blind belief and blind belief is not going  
to help in life. A person who wants to make millions of $ is better than a  
person who lives in a life of penury, who talks about spirituality and makes  
claims that one has right over only action and not its fruits, life is for  
only realization, etcâ¦ without really knowing what he is saying so. It is  
like a Sanyasi who thinks about world compared to a Gruhasta who things about  
Sanyasa!   
Every thought has a cause. The cause is a desire to enjoy some fruits. Some  
notion, that, by doing something, we will be happy. Unless, we, by ourselves,  
properly understand the dynamics of thought process, we will never be able to  
be like Krishna or be like the famous verse of his - surrendering the fruits  
of action. We are merely repeating the words uttered by Krishna, Ramana,  
Ramakrishna, etc... But the fact is what they have said is not yet REAL in our  
case. For instance, we still derive happiness from the world more than the  
desire to realise the Self and we try to suppress ourselves out of happiness  
we are deriving just because Krishna has said so, or, Ramana has said so, or,  
just because scriptures says so. We go about and claim that everybody has to  
realise the Self. We all have shades of hypocracy in us. The reason is due to  
lack of proper discernment.   
Bhagavan says, for every thought, there is this 'I' that is the substratum of  
all thoughts. He says, enquire where from this 'I' originates. Untill this is  
properly discerned, all these quotes about surrendering fruits to God, all is  
God, all remain mere book knowledge.   
Now, if Krishna has said so, or, Ramana has said so, we believe that there is  
truth in it blindly, because of their stature. Yes they do have that stature,  
but that does not mean that we begin to blindly impose onto ourselves what  
they say without really understanding. Krishna has said so, so I should not  
expecting fruits for my actions, Ramana has said so, so I should enquire who  
am I. We all have to study, go to the basics, the roots and begin. I felt.   
We ought to, (no other option) but to properly dedicate ourselves properly in  
understanding the scheme of things independently. Now, Krishna has said  
something, Ramana Maharshi has said something, Vedanta says something, now let  
me sit and scrutinise things myself independently and see for myself what  
really it is.   
This is Tapas. One has to work out oneâs own salvation. And, it is not going  
to help by just saying this moment, that, I surrender my fruits to God and  
resume our worldly duties. That is Unconscious surrendering of fruits, it is  
just like sleep, the world resumes once again after sleep! It remains as Karma  
still continues. Only proper understanding shall relieve one from all his  
Karmas.   
Salutations to Bhagavan

Dear Nagaraj   
Taking the liberty to type fast in a rough language. Please dont mind.   
It is all very confusing for me in your current post: what do you mean by this line   
"There is no possibility of surrendering the fruits to God without proper  
understanding. "   
What understanding you mean here? Intellectual understanding or final  
spiritual understanding ?   
"Knowledge alone relieves. Stopping a thought process ain't going to help  
really!"   
What is this again? what is Knowledge? Intellecutal knowledge never relieves  
anybody. Stopping the flow of thoughts is very good for sadhana right? Why  
that is not going to help?   
Even giving away fruits of work one must start intellectually right? How can  
one call Ishwara in person and then as a token of giving away fruits, give  
some apples or some betel leaves and say mantras?   
What is giving away of fruits? It is and it has to start as an intellectual  
surrender only right? Unfortunately all our sadhana has to start in the  
alrady heated and confused brain only. For a long time, we continue doing  
brain sadhana only.   
There is nothing wrong in whatsover way we are doing our so called sadhana.  
In fact everything is wrong. Only reason we are to do continuously is to give  
up all efforts and sit in a corner with 'summa iru' state.   
So what else I can do than merely repeating the words of great jnanis? Let me  
tell from my experience, no matter how many times I chant my Gurus name and  
bang my head against my wall of brain, I cannot realise saradamma's state.  
Yes world's mean lust pleasures still attract me more than anything else. But  
atleast let me turn to these jnanis and observe all the time their external  
life and teachings. Even though I understand or not, let me write as some  
science theorum and again and again repeat it madly.   
Let me l have shades of hypocracy. Let me not have proper discernment. But  
in the deep corner of my heart, I have developed a utter distaste and infact  
utter restlessness with my current state of affairs. That deep corner makes  
me wander after my Guru and Ramana \-- my Guru's Guru's Guru. So let that  
infintesimal spark remain as it is, even if it does not melt antartica.

Dear sreeswaroop,   
Yes. When any one not belonging to brahmin caste by birth, can attain Brahma  
Jnanam, through tapas and vicharam. Then he   
becomes a Brahmin. In fact Sri Bhagavan used to define Brahmin as one who is a  
Brahmanishta, and not others. This is what   
Hastamalaka also tells in his reply to Sri Sankara.
