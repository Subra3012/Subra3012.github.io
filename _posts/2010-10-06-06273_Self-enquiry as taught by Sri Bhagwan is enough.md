**Brahman beyond speech & thought: (Anuvaga 4 of Anandavalli)**   
When all words turn back as well as Manas, without reaching; he who knows  
Brahman's bliss fears not at any time. There of -of the former- this one  
verily is the self-embodied. Than that verily, than this one formed of Manas -  
there is another self within; formed of Vijnana. By him this one is filled.  
(The inner self of Manomaya is Vijnanamaya). He verily this one, is quite of  
man's shape. After his human shape, this one is of man's shape.   
**Of him, faith surely is the head, righteousness is the right wing, truth is  
the left wing, yoga is the self and Mahah is the tail, the support. On that as  
well there is this verse.**   
 **Note** : Even though we get pains in our body it is not body that feels  
pain but it is mind that feels pain.That is the reason why doctors give  
anestisa to escape from pain.   
 **Contemplation of Vijnana as the Hiranyagaryabha: (Anuvaga 5 of Anandavalli)**   
Intelligence accomplishes sacrifice and deeds as well does it accomplish.  
Intelligence do all Gods worship as Brahman, the eldest. If intelligence as  
Brahman, one knows if from that he swerves not, in body sins forsaking, he all  
desires achieves. There of - of all the former, this one is the self-embodied.  
Than that verily, than this one formed of Vijnana- there is another self  
within; formed of bliss. By him this one is filled. He verily this one, is  
quite of man's shape. After his human shape, this one is of man's shape. **Of  
him, love itself is the head, joy is the right wing, delight is the left wing,  
bliss is the self and Brahman is the tail, the support.** On that, too, there  
is this verse.   
 **Note** : **Sri Sundara chaitanya Swami says sankalpas/vikalpas are done by  
mind but decided by buddi i.e intelligence vignanamaya kosam.   
Decision was done by Intelligence i.e vignanamaya kosam.   
So karta is intellect and not mind as we thought in previous verse.**   
So here we naturally think we are intellect.   
Mind,body are instruments only.   
 **Suppose we go into a hotel then mind will show all its fav choices to eat  
before intellect like idly,vada etc.Then finally intellect will take decision  
and will select one tiffen to eat.   
So decision is taken by vignanamaya kosam.But body decision is also important  
as suppose our body donot have teeth then intellect should change the decision  
of eating breakfast as few items cannot be taken without teeth.**   
So aham vritti(EGO) is vignanamaya kosam and other thoughts are dependent on  
this aham vritti.   
Sraddha is important for disciple to succeed in devotion.   
 **Brahman - the One being: (Anuvaga 6 of Anandavalli)**   
Non- being, verily, does one become if he as non-being knows Brahman. If one  
knows that Brahman is, then they regard him as being. Thus reads the verse.  
There of - of the former, this one is the self-embodied. Hence, then, the  
questions that follow: whether does any one who knows nor, departing, goes to  
that region? Or does any one who knows, departing attain that region. He  
desired: many may I be, may I be born; He made Tapas; Having made Tapas. He  
sent forth all this and that of this more. This having sent forthwith, into  
that very thing, He then entered. That having entered, both the being and the  
beyond, He became the definite and the indefinite, the abode and the non-  
abode, the conscious and the unconscious, both the real and the false, did the  
Real become, and whatever else is here. That they say, is the Real.   
 **Note** : **Sri Sundara chaitanya Swami** says In Deep sleep we are infact  
happy as told by Ramana Maharshi.   
 **Because there is happiness every living being likes to sleep and even  
prepares his bed so carefully to sleep.   
And also there is no need to tell anyone to sleep as automatically we will  
sleep if required.But no one really wants to getup from sleep as we donot want  
to lose happiness.**   
 **He said One god in world first created few things in the world and then  
started thinking what to do next in next consecutive days which is funny.**   
 **Brahman - as external objects: (Anuvaga 7 of Anandavalli)**   
Non being verily, this was in the beginning. Then indeed, the being was born;  
that created itself by itself. Then that the Self cause is called. That one  
called the Self cause, He is the flavour. Flavour indeed, this one having got,  
blessed becomes he. Who indeed could live, who breathe, should not this bliss  
be in akasa; this it is that bestows bliss. When in truth this (soul) gains  
fearless support in Him who is invisible, selfless, undefined, non-abode then  
has he the fearless reached. When indeed this (soul) makes in this one even  
the smallest break, then for him, there is fear. That verily, is fear to the  
knower who does not reflect. On that, too, there is this verse.   
 **Note** : **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says happiness is our nature and it  
cannot be found in external objects.If really happiness is found outside in  
then it will become jadam i.e insentient.**   
 **He says yoga school is ok till some extent to get concentration of mind and  
also for body maintenence but cannot be useful to reach our goal.**   
 **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says without effort we will get happiness in  
deep sleep.So happiness is not dependent on outside external objects.**   
 **Who attains Brahman?   
(Anuvaga 8 of Anandavalli)**   
 **From fear of Him does Wind blow, from fear of Him does Sun rise, from fear  
of Him, Agni and Indra (act) and death the fifth does run. Now, this is the  
enquiry concerning bliss.**   
 **Suppose a youth, a good youth, learned in the sacred love, promptest in  
action, steadiest in heart, strongest in body - suppose his is all this earth,  
full of wealth. This is one human bliss.**   
What is a hundred times the human bliss, that is one bliss of the human  
fairies, as also of the man versed in the Vedas, not smitten by passion.   
What is a hundred times the bliss of the human fairies, that is one bliss of  
the celestial fairies, as also of the man versed in the Vedas, not smitten by  
passion.   
What is a hundred times the bliss of the celestial fairies, that is one bliss  
of the Pitris, who dwell in the long-enduring world, as also of the man versed  
in the Vedas, not smitten by passion.   
What is a hundred times the bliss of the Pitris, who dwell in the long-  
enduring world, that is one bliss of the Devas born in the Ajana, as also of  
the man versed in the Vedas, not smitten by passion.   
What is a hundred times the bliss of the Devas born in the Ajana, that is one  
bliss of the Devas (known as) Karma-Devas, those who have reached Devas by  
work, as also of the man versed in the Vedas, not smitten by passion.   
What is a hundred times the bliss of the Karma - Devas, that is one bliss of  
the Devas, as also of the man versed in the Vedas, not smitten by passion.  
(Note: Here, "Devas" connotes the 33 Devas [8 vasus; 11 rudras; 12 adityas;  
Indra and Prajapathi]- who have a right to partake the oblations offered in  
the sacrificial rites)   
What is a hundred times the bliss of the Devas, that is one bliss of Indra, as  
also of the man versed in the Vedas, not smitten by passion. (Note: Indra is  
the Lord of Devas)   
What is a hundred times the bliss of Indra, that is one bliss of Brihaspathi  
(Indra's teacher), as also of the man versed in the Vedas, not smitten by  
passion.   
What is a hundred times the bliss of Brihaspathi, that is one bliss of  
Prajapathi (the Lord of creatures, is the viraj, who has the three worlds for  
his body), as also of the man versed in the Vedas, not smitten by passion.   
What is a hundred times the bliss of Prajapathi, that is one bliss of Brahma,  
as also of the man versed in the Vedas, not smitten by passion.   
 **Note** : **Sri Sundara chaitanya Swami says In anandamaya kosam there is no  
karta and only bhokta hence there is absolute happiness.**   
 **In deep sleep happiness which we gain has no reason where as happiness we  
gain in dreams and waking states have some reason for our happiness.   
Example: we get happiness if we eat gulab jam etc but in deep sleep there is  
no reason as it is our natural state.  
**Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says god and creation is not different as he  
himself thought of becoming many and hence came creation.   
So as adi sankara said world is false and brahman is true and world is  
brahman.**   
 **Sri Sundara chaitanya Swami says man is not born due to papam but only due  
to previous janma punyam only.In one religion it is told that man is born with  
a sin. He says if that is the case then everywork he does will also become sin  
as it is sinner who is doing the karma.**   
 **He says when ramana maharshi comes even lord indra shoukd even stand and  
respect him.Such is the power of ramana maharshi.**   
 **Anandamaya Kosa described:**   
Brahma means - Hiranyagarbha, who is manifested as the universal being as well  
as the individual beings who pervades all the universe of Samsara in whom all  
bliss unite into one, who possess Dharma which causes that bliss, the  
knowledge concerning Dharma and its results, as also the utmost freedom from  
desire.   
And this one, who is in the man, and that one who is in the Sun, He is one. He  
who knows departing from this world, attains this Annamaya self; this  
Pranamaya self does he attain; this Manomaya self he attains; this Vijnanamaya  
self he attains; he attains this Anandamaya Self. On that, too, there is this  
verse.   
 **Note** : **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says in one religion it says that  
god created the sun on 5th day and he criticised and said that how can we know  
4 days have passed when sun itself is created on 5th day.   
He said it is shame on humanity to write those kind of holy texts.**   
 **Sri Sundara Chaitanya swami says happiness cannot be retrieved by even  
mixture of combination of sense object + mind + indriyas combination.   
He said there is one school who believes that the above combination gives  
perfect happiness.   
That particular school gives example of killi in which the leaf is in green  
colour and sunnam is in white colour and vokkapodi is in brown colour.But  
finally when we mix those we will get red colour.So that school similarly we  
get perfect happiness in a mixture of combination of sense object + mind +  
indriyas combination.   
However sri sundara chaitanya swami does not agree with above argument and  
says darkness(sense objects) + darkness(mind) + darkness(indriyas) cannot  
bring light.**   
 **Brahman is beyond speech and thought: (Anuvaga 9 of Anandavalli)**   
He who knows the bliss of Brahman when all words recede, as well as mind,  
without reaching, he is not afraid of any one whatsoever. Him, verily, the  
thought not burns, why I have not done the right? Why have I done sin? Who so  
knows thus, these two as the self does he cherish. Both these, verily as the  
self does he cherish who thus knows. Such is the sacred wisdom.   
 **Peace Chants:**   
May Brahman protect us (the Guru and Sishya) both!   
May he give us both to enjoy!   
Efficiency may we both attain!   
Effective may our study prove!   
Hate may we not (each other) at all!

Dear prasanth,   
Nice description.   
 That Brahman exists as the cause of fear and fearlessness,   
of the men of ignorance and knowledge. For fearlessness comes   
as a result of taking refuge in something that exists. Whereas fear cannot  
cease by resorting to something that does not exist. Therefore Brahman causes  
fearlessness since there is nothing other than that in this nondual universe.  
Hence a Brahmavit also does not have fear since he is Brahman and there is  
nothing else other than   
him.   
Jnanam alone can give fearlessness. Jnanam is another name for   
Brahman. The Jnanam cleans up the ignorance, which gives room   
for fear, because ignorance seeks the support of things which are   
ephemeral. Like wealth, health, wife, son, land and gold. A Jnani   
without any of these, is fearless because he is Jnanam. He knows   
that all the ephemeral things take birth in Brahman, lives in Brahman and  
dissolves in Brahman.   
Bhagavan Ramana says this in Verse 2 of Sri Arunachala Pancharatnam: As on a screen, a wondrous picture,   
On You, fair Hill, is all this world,   
Formed, sustained, and then withdrawn,   
Ever as 'I' in the Heart you dance,   
Hence You are called the Heart.   
Arunachala Siva.

M.P. Pandit of Aurobindo Ashram called Sri Bhagavan as Mighty Impersonality.   
Dear Sri Subramanian Sir,   
I became very happy to learn that Sri M.P. Pandit of the Aurbindo Asharam  
called Sri Bhagwan the Mighty Impersonality. Thank you so much, sir. SRI  
BHAGWAN IS THE IMPERSONAL ABSOLUTE BEING. EVEN AN INCARNATION IS AN ASPECT OF  
GOD. SRI BHAGWAN IS GOD HIMSELF.   
 Personality is that which divides and separates us from all other beings. It  
is based on the ego-mind which thinks itself to be a conscious and intelligent  
being different from all other beings. But we, the devotees of Sri Bhawan, by  
His Grace, are now aware that the consciousness that the ego-mind has is not  
its own but merely the reflection of the minute fraction of the Consciousness  
of the Supreme Self, just as minute fraction of the light of the sun reflected  
from the water in a pot produces the tiny image of the gigantic sun in the pot  
itself.   
On the contrary, Impersonality is the State of Egolessness. Therefore, which  
one is mightier or greater, personality or impersonality? On the face,  
personality appears to be something where as Impersonality appears to be  
nothing. But, nevertheless, we know that personality is a limitation to a  
body, name, while Impersonality is beyond any limitation whatever. It is  
infinite Consciousness. Personality is consciousness confined, limited and  
impure whereas Impersonality is Supreme Consciousness ItselfUnconfined,  
Infinite and Pure. Personality is bondage, Impersonality is freedom form  
bondage. One is sheer dark ignorance, the other is Knowledge, Light.   
Therefore, Sri M. P. Pandit very aptly called Sri Bhagwan the Mighty  
Impersonality, for,Sri Bhagwan shines now in His True Nature as the WHOLE  
unveiled and therefore is the Embodiment of the Mightiest Impersonality who  
ever appeared within the relative existence of time and space, or so-called  
mathematical space-time.   
Sri Sadhu Om Swamigal sings his prayer-hymn thus : Not to teach the world, the myth,   
Not to gain a mass of wealth,   
Not for name and fame that hails,   
Flock you all and worship Him,   
Tis not for these I sing this hymn;   
Only for the great reward,   
The death of ego, I pray, my Lord !   
 V. 68, Ramana Guruvarul Antadi, cited from The Path of Sri Ramana, Part One

Dear Anil,   
Even during Sri Bhagavan's times, many came for ordinary requests, like good  
health,   
transfer of job to Tiruvannamalai, marriage for their daughters etc., Sri  
Bhagavan   
graced them all. But as Sri Sadhu Om said: The best prayer to Sri Bhagavan is

Sri Bhagavan replied: He who gives himself up to the Self that is God is the  
most excellent devotee.   
Giving one's self up to God means remaining constantly in the Self without  
giving room for rise of   
any thoughts other than the thought of the Self.   
With this answer, Sri Bhagavan summed up devotion and surrender.   
Dear Sri Subramanian Sir,   
I cite below the V. 28 of the Ulladu Narpadu to say what I wish to say as  
following : As one would dive to recover something that has fallen into water, even so,  
one should, with a keen mind, dive into oneself, controlling speech and  
breath, and find the place whence the swell I rises. Thus should you know.   
 V. 28, Ulladu Narpadu, Ramana Maharshi and His Philosophy of Existence   
Therefore, Self-enquiry for the Self consists in mobilising all the energies  
of the body and the mind, rejecting or subduing all thoughts, and then  
directing all the energies thus mobilised into a single resolve of finding the  
answer to the One All-Important Question Who Am I ?. Sri Bhagwan says that  
just as one dives into water, seeking a precious article that has fallen, so  
too the seeker of his own Truth should dive into the Heart, with firm resolve,  
restraining the speech and the vital breath, to find the answer to the  
question Who am I? or Where form rises the sense of the self in the ego?   
Dear sir, the diver is supposed to be fully devoted to the purpose of seeking  
the lost article, restrains his breath and even ties some weight to his waist  
and dives into water and finds the lost article. So Sri Bhagwan says that one  
must love the Self and be fully devoted to the purpose of finding It,  
restraining his speech and breath. If one does not love the Self, how can he  
be fully devoted to seeking It? Therefore, resolve to find the Self is the  
dynamic element and brings about the devotional aspect in the Enquiry. I must  
be fully devoted so that, by ingathering all the vital and mental energies,  
and by directing them Self-ward, I am able to seek the sense of the Self I  
am in the ego I am Anil.   
Sri Bhagwan says that success is assured to him who so dives into the Heart.  
For, if the seekers mind becomes pure by such practice, the Sadguru says that  
some mysterious force rises from within, takes possession of his mind and  
takes it straight to the Heart. However, if such love and devotion is not  
there, the seekers need to practice the Enquiry with perseverance, or other  
yoga or some other spiritual practices, as enjoined by Sri Bhagwan, until  
their minds become pure and strong, and are able to seek the Self with such  
devotion and steady resolve. With such pure and strong mind one is able to  
sink into the Heart and is able to abide in the Self progressively for longer  
and longer period till the Sentience-insentience knot is cut and one is  
ultimately Self-realised. Sri Bhagwan says that to such a one, success is  
assured.   
Therefore, dear sir, you have very rightly said that giving ones self up to  
God means remaining constantly in the Self without giving room for rise of any  
thought other than the thought of the Self. This, indeed, is the Essence of  
Bhakti, Jnana, and Yoga.   
Regards,   
 Anil

Dear Anil,   
Yes. The verse of Sad Darsanam you have quoted, is giving the method of self  
inquiry,   
which involves concentration, one pointedness towards the purpose, etc., In   
Upadesa Saram, Sri Bhagavan says in Verse 10, as to what is bhakti, jnana,  
yoga   
and karma: Absorption in the heart of being,   
Whence we sprang,   
Is the path of action, of devotion,   
Of union and knowledge.   
The whole thing is summarized here. I used to call it as Atom Bomb Verse/   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sri Subramanian Sir,   
Ji. Yes. And in V. 29 of the Upadesa Saram, Sri Bhagwan says: To remain in the state of Self, having attained the Supreme Bliss, which is  
devoid of both bondage and liberation, is truly to be in the service of the  
Lord.   
 In this verse also Sri Bhagwan says that true Devotion to the Lord is to  
remain in the state of the Self, having attained the Supreme Bliss. Bondage  
and liberation is for the ego. And devotion is not true devotion so long as  
the devotee believes that he is separate from the Lord. For, believing oneself  
to be a separate entity apart from God or Brahman is obviously usurping His  
All-encompassing Reality of Being-Consciousness-Bliss. So, this is, in fact,  
an act of thieving.   
Therefore, surrendering utterly ones individuality is alone the true Devotion  
and true Jnana. Similarly, remaining in the state of Self, having attained the  
Supreme Bliss, devoid of both bondage and liberation is true Jnana and true  
Service, true love, and true Devotion to the Lord. Sri Bhagwan says in the  
next Verse, i.e., V. 30 that this is also the greatest Tapas. This alone is  
our prime duty. This alone is the Path of Bhagwan Sri Ramana.   
Thank you so much, sir.   
Regards,   
 Anil

Dear Devotees,   
Sri Bhagwan reveals: If the mind is thus well fixed in sadhana (attending to the Self), a power of  
divine Grace will then rise from within of its own accord and subjugating the  
mind will take it to the Heart.   
What is this power of the Divine Grace, Sri Bhagwan on many occasions spoke  
of, and that rises from within of its own accord? Sri Sadhu Om in his The  
Path of Sri Ramana says that it is nothing but the perfect clarity of our  
existence the form of the Supreme Self, ever shining with abundant Grace in  
the Heart as I-I. IT IS THE CLARITY OF THE EXPERIENCE OF I AM.   
Yes. Dear devotees, there comes a stage in the sadhana of the Atma-vichara  
when the seeker of Truth, by the strength of his practice, is able to cognise  
tangibly what is the state of absorption of the ego and what exactly is the  
state of abidance in Self-awareness. However, this state is sporadic and not  
the final state of Self-realisation, for, the seeker in this state swings  
form the state of Self-abidance to the state of extroversion to second and  
third persons. Therefore, this is not the final state of liberation Sri  
Bhagwan speaks of.   
An iron needle lying within a magnetic field is attracted to it only when it  
is dust free, though magnetic intensity is naturally existing all the time,  
even when the needle is rusted. But, all the same, the needle is attracted to  
the magnet only to the extent that it loses the rust.   
So also, turning the attention away from the second and third persons and  
clinging to the first person is akin to scrapping the rust from the needle so  
that it is attracted to the magnet.   
Therefore, the purpose of the sadhana of the Atma-vichara is only to become  
fit for becoming a prey to be devoured by the magnetic field of the  
Consciousness of the Self which is ever shining whether we are fit to be  
attracted or not.   
Sri Sadhu Om says that a mature aspirant will willingly and without rebelling  
submit himself to this great magnetic attraction of the Grace of the Self-  
effulgence. And on the other hand, those who are not yet fit will externalise  
their attention, fearing the attraction of the Great Effulgence of the Self.   
Therefore, Sri Bhagwan says that one must become a fit prey. How ? By intense  
love to know the Self and by dispassion of having no desire to attend to  
second and third persons.   
Sri Om adds that since our very individuality as an aspirant itself is  
devoured, even the so-called effort of ours becomes nil. I-consciousness  
is then made to sink into the Heart, the real waking, the dawn of knowledge  
(Jnana), takes place. When a seeker is finally fit and ready, it happens in a  
split second! WHEN THE SUN OF JNANA RISES, THE DARKNES OF IGNORANCE IS  
EVAPORATED IN A TRICE. Sadhana is to bring about that pristine moment.   
Thank you,   
 Anil

Dear Anil,   
Nice Post.   
Yes, when the mind gets cleared off the dirt and dust, the Consciousness  
attracts   
that pure mind [or for that matter, Pure Mind is itself the Self], and shines  
a lightning   
flash, as Awareness, "I am" \- ness.   
This is described by Sri Bhagavan, in Verse 3 of Atma Vidya Kirtanam: .....   
That one light that shines as many selves   
Seeing the Self within   
As Awareness' lightning flash;   
The play of Grace; the ego's death;   
The blossoming of Bliss.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sri Subramanian Sir,   
Ji. Yes. Sri Bhagwan says that cinema-pictures are seen on the screen with the  
help of a small light in an environment of darkness. If that darkness is  
suddenly dispelled by a big, intense light, will the pictures on the screen be  
visible? No, the pictures on the screen, along with the small light that  
enables the pictures on the screen to be visible and seen, will be merged in  
the flood of the big light. Will not the small light be drowned in an  
effulgence of light? In the same way, we see the world with small, feeble  
light called mind and find it full of different colours. However, Sri Bhagwan  
says that if we see it with the big light known as Self-realisation, we will  
find that It is one continuous universal light of Awareness, Knowledge, no  
creatures, no world and nothing else whatever.   
Thank you so much, sir.

(To be viewed in continuation with my post, re. 1353)   
By the play of the force in the nerve channels, the flow of the ray of  
consciousness is understood. All the forces of the body are dependent on the  
distinct nerve-channels.   
 V. 9-9, Sri Ramana Gita   
The consciousness is in a separate distinct Nadi. They call it the Sushumna.  
Some say it is the supreme Atmanadi, others call it the Amritanadi.   
 V. 9-10, Sri Ramana Gita   
Abandoning the conceit about the body and the notion of the body as the Self,  
if a person of well-developed intellect enquires, one-pointedly, the churning  
of the Nadis will take place.   
 V. 9-12, Sri Ramana Gita   
Thus by the churning of the Nadis, the Self gets separated. It resorts to the  
one Amrita Nadi and shines forth.   
 V. 9-13, Sri Ramana Gita   
Dear Devotees,   
As soon as we wake up from the sleep, adjunctless and attributeless  
I-consciousness shoots like lightening from the Heart to the brain. Then it  
spreads throughout the body through the nerves. It is like electrical energy  
and the motive force or the potential difference is the identification with  
the body as the Self, or I. This consciousness remains pure till it reaches  
the brain. This I-consciousness spreads from the brain at a tremendous speed  
throughout the body through the nerves like the flow of electrical energy  
through the electrical wires. Alas ! After reaching the brain this Pure  
Consciousness I Am gets mixed with the adjunct Anil or I AM SO AND SO and  
I am the body idea is the result. This is what is called the knot of bondage  
or the Sentience-Insentience knot or granthi.   
Therefore, when the attention is on the second and third persons,  
I-consciousness spreads from the brain to all over the body through the  
nerves. Now, what will happen if the attention is focussed on the first person  
? The power of the consciousness that was responsible for its spreading takes  
the form of Self-attention, i.e., the power of being. So, the power of doing  
is transformed into the power of being. THIS IS WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE  
CHURNING OF NADIS.WHEN THIS CHURNING TAKES PLACE IN THE NADIS, THE  
CONSCIOUSNESS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE BODY IS WITHDRAWN IN THE BRAIN FROM  
WHERE IT SCATTERED IN THE FIRST PLACE. FROM THE BRAIN IT DESCENDS TO THE  
HEART, THE SOURCE OF ITS RISING, AND IS MERGED IN THE PURE CONSCIOUSNESS. This  
is Jnana.   
Dear devotees, in the path of Yoga, the I-consciousness scattered throughout  
the body is forcibly pushed back to the brain from where it spreads by the  
practice of BREATH-RETENTION. But this is a violent method. Sri Bhagwan very  
beautifully compares this method to chasing a run-away cow, beating it,  
catching hold of it, dragging it forcibly to the shed and finally tying it  
there; on the other hand, bringing back the I-consciousness to its source  
by Self-enquiry is a gentle and peaceful method, like tempting the cow by  
showing it a handful of green grass, cajoling and fondling it, making it  
follows us of its own accord to the shed and finally tying it there.  
Therefore, the self-enquiry as taught by Sri Bhagwan is rather a safe and  
pleasant path vis-a vis the path of Yoga. Moreover, in the violent method of  
Yoga, the body must be young and strong for the churning of the Nadis to  
successfully happen. This churning of Nadis in a weak and old body may cause  
severe disorder of the nervous system and other physical and mental disorders.  
SRI BHAWN ASSURES THAT THERE IS NO SUCH DANGER IF THE CHURNING OF NADIS  
HAPPEN BY HOLDING THE ATTENTION ON THE SELF, I.E., BY ENQUIRY, FOR WITHDRAWAL  
OF CONSCIUOSNESS TAKES PLACE WITHOUT ANY STRAIN AND AS PEACEFULLY AS FALLING  
OF DEW. HAIL TO BHAGWAN SRI RAMAN ! No age barrier, no youthfulness required.   
Dear devotees, the channel through which the I-consciousness rises from the  
Heart and spreads all over the body is called the Sushumna Nadi which can be  
experienced only during the withdrawal of consciousness again from the brain  
to the Heart. Therefore, Shusumna Nadi is that channel through which the  
I-consciousness is experienced in the trunk of the body from the Muladhara  
to Sahasrara or from the base of the spine to the top of the head during  
withdrawal of the consciousness to the Heart, the source. During this  
withdrawal of consciousness to the Heart, one is said to have experiences of  
divine visions and other divine experiences. BUT ONE SHOULD PRESS ON, BECAUSE  
THEIR VERY OCCURANCES IMPLY THAT THE EXPERIENCER IS STILL THERE. SO THE  
ENQUIRY WHO EXPEREINCES THESE DIVINE VISIONS AND THE OTHER DIVINE  
EXPERIENCES? IS IMPERATIVE SO THAT ONE ISNOT SWERVED FROM THE ENQUIRY WITHOUT  
THE SUCCESSFUL CULMINATION OF THE SADHANA.   
 To continue   
Thank you,   
 Anil

Dear Sri Subramanian Sir,   
Ji. Yes. I am aware of this episode. I am really very surprised. In The Power  
of the Presence, Part Three, P. 167, it is mentioned that Sri Ganapati Muni,  
though he was an ardent devotee of Sri Bhagwan, did not subscribe to His  
Advaita philosophy. He was, instead, a follower of Sakta Philosophy, which  
believed that both the world and the individual soul were real, rather than  
illusory. The book also mentions that in his translation of Sat Darshanam, all  
efforts were made to appear that that Sri Bhagwan did not teach Advaita.  
Moreover, that standpoint was negated in every possible way. When this fact  
was brought to the notice of Sri Bhagwan, He is reported to have said that Sri  
Muni and his disciples were ardent adherents of the Sakta cult, implying  
thereby their unwillingness to allow Advaita teachings to be conveyed as the  
genuine Teachings of Sri Bhagwan !   
Thank you so much, sir.

Dear Sri Subramanian Sir,   
The Verse 23, Reality on Forty Verses : Supplement, is cited below: That indeed is the essential Heart and in it all this world abides. It is the  
mirror in which all things are seen. It is the source of all wealth. HENCE  
AWARENESS MAY BE TERMED THE HEART OF ALL BEINGS. The Heart is not a part of  
the perishable body inert like a stone.   
The Pure Awareness is the Heart of all beings the sentient as well as the  
insentient. Therefore, any description of the Heart is only a mental concept.  
Hridayam means This is the Centre and is therefore verily the Self and the  
Self is here, there, and everywhere.   
We, the ignorant creatures with body consciousness, were given a physical  
location for the Heart, for That which transcends space and time, on the right  
side of the chest because Sri Bhagwan reveals that it is the Seat of  
Realisation.   
I said in my post, re.1358, that Consciousness flows from the Heart through  
Sushumna Nadi ( Nerve) to Sahasrara and from Sahasrara, Consciousness spreads,  
by its power of spreading, to all over the body, resulting in the experience  
of the world and of the second and third persons (idam).   
Thank you so much, sir.

Controlling speech and breath, and diving deep within oneselflike one who, to  
find a thing that has fallen into water, dives deep down one must seek out  
the source whence the aspiring ego springs.   
 V. 28, Reality in Forty Verses   
Therefore by the practice of merging the ego in the pure Heart which is all  
Awareness, the tendencies of the mind as well as the breath will be subdued.   
 V. 24, Reality in Forty Verses: Supplement   
 (Orig. Yoga Vasishta, 5-78, V. 38)   
Dear Devotees,   
From the above cited Verses, it is obvious that by controlling speech and  
breath, Sri Bhagwan does not mean that one should start practicing breath  
retention of pranayama to restrain and control the breath, though Sri  
Bhagwan Himself has said that it is an aid to Enquiry. Therefore, one may  
practice breath control a little in the beginning to turn the mind inwards. I  
SAY THIS, WITH ALL HUMILTY, THAT I FIRST STARTED PRACTICING PRANAYAMA, THEN  
SOMETIME LATER IT DAWNED ON ME OF ITS OWN ACCORD THAT I SHOULD ASK WHO AM  
I?, AND THEN CAME TO SRI BHAGWAN. Having said this, I wish to say that if  
one is seized with ardent longing to find the True Nature of His Existence and  
turns inwards, the breath stops automatically of its own accord. There is no  
essential need to bring it about by the practice of breath control of hatha-  
yoga or for that matter by any other yogic practices.   
Sri Bhagwan says that both mind and breath have a common conscious source,  
i.e. the Heart or the Self. Hence control of one leads to the control of the  
other automatically. However, so far as breath control is concerned, Sri  
Bhagwan recommends watching of the breath with the mind. If one constantly  
watches the breathits rising and sinkingit certainly has the effect of  
stilling the mind. But we should always remember Sri Bhagwans Teaching in  
this context that the stilling of mind brought about by the breath regulation  
is temporary in its effect. It cannot confer on one Realisation by itself.   
Dear devotees, we experience in our everyday life that when some startling  
news is suddenly broken to us, or when the mind is engaged in some activity  
with full concentration, the breath stops or slows down automatically of its  
own accord. So also, as soon as the mind, with ardent and intense longing to  
know the truth of ones own existence, turns inwards with full concentration,  
breath will certainly stop automatically. Breath regulation achieved in this  
manner is natural and the enquirer does not experience suffocation  
irrespective of the state and duration of the retention, contrary to the  
retention brought about by pranayama, in which if unit of time of retention is  
increased, suffocation is experienced and there is an urge either to exhale or  
to inhale. On the contrary, if the enquirers attention is intensely fixed on  
the Self, he will not even care to know whether the breath has stopped or not.  
Therefore, the breath regulation thus brought about by enquiry is rather  
involuntary. WHAT I MEAN TO SAY IS THAT THE ENQUIRERS ATTENTION SHOULD  
INTENSELY REMAIN FIXED ON THE SELF AND REMAIN VIGILLANT AND SHOULD NOT CARE  
WETHER THE BREATH STOPPED OR SLOWD DOWN OR NOT.   
 So,Sri Bhagwan says, One should dive within, controlling speech and breath,  
with a keen introverted mind.   
SRI SADHU OMS INSIGHT: IT WOULD BE WISE TO UNDERASTAND THE VERSE 28, ULLADU NARPADU, THUS BY ADDING  
WITH A KEEN MIND IN ALL THE THREE PLACES, CONTROL THE BREATH WITH A KEEN  
MIND, DIVE WITHIN WITH A KEEN MIND, AND KNOW THE RISING-PLACE WITH A KEEN  
MIND.   
Therefore, the V. 24, ( Supplement: Forty Verses on Reality) teaches that by  
the practice of fixing the mind (attention) in the Heart (Self), the Pure  
Consciousness, both the destruction of tendencies (vasanas) and the control of  
breath are accomplished automatically.   
Thank You,   
 Anil

Dear Sri Subramanian Sir,   
Silence

 Speech (Words)   
Therefore, Sri Bhagwan says that words are the great grandson of the Original  
Source. In my view, it is more accurate than saying that Silence is the  
grandfather of the speech, for, Silence is the Ultimate Father; there is no  
lineage of forefathers to trace before the Silence. Sri Bhagwan says that if  
words can produce effect, we should ourselves judge how much more powerful  
Silence Itself should be ! Guru is the bestower of that Silence. Sri Bhagwan  
says that Gurus Silence is more vast and more emphatic than all the sastras  
put together. Indeed, a Self-Realised Jnani alone can fathom the Silence of  
the Self.

Dear Sri Anand Sundaram,   
Self-enquiry can always be practiced, whatever be the environment and  
circumstances. Sri Bhagwan has taught and as I have understood and practiced  
It, the feeling I am acting (sense of doership) alone is the obstacle. If  
we ask who works and remember who we really are, the work cannot bind us. It  
will then go on automatically, discrimination needed to do a job efficiently,  
will be automatic and intuitive, just as when we walk, we take steps  
involuntarily. Do we not ? This is how, in truth, happens all actions. We  
falsely ascribe or superimpose the idea of doership on to ourselves. What is  
destined to happen will happen. If one is destined not to work, work cannot be  
had. If we are destined to work, one cannot be able to avoid it. Sri Bhagwan: MAKE NO EFFORT EITHER TO WORK OR TO RENOUNCE; YOUR EFFORT IS  
BONDAGE. So, the best course is to leave the work or action to the Higher  
Power, we cannot renounce or retain as we choose.   
We must understand that neither we are apart from the Self or God nor the work  
is apart from the Self. Work also cannot go on without the Self. In truth, we  
need not strain ourselves to be engaged in them or not to be engaged in them.  
The work will go on of itself. Lord Sri Krishna told Sri Arjuna that he need  
not trouble to kill the Kaurvas; they were already slain by God.   
Therefore, dear Sri Anand, while one is engaged in search of Self or God  
WITHIN, OUTER work is sure to go on automatically.   
Sri Bhagwan: Attending to the Self means attending to the work. Because you  
identify yourself with the body, you think that work is done by you. But the  
body and its activities, including that work, are not apart from the Self.  
What does it matter whether you attend to the work or not?   
The child who was fed by the mother while asleep next morning says to the  
mother that he did not take the food. The mother knows that he did. So, the  
child is not aware yet the action went on. Similarly, whether one is aware  
not, destined work will go on.   
The Kingdom of God is within. Our own Real Self is God. So, if we seek the  
Self within, all things fall into their proper place and perspective IN OUR  
MIND. God is in us and in all things now, and we along with our little  
individual world are in God or the Self only, here and now. If we understand  
that we also realise that all things and circumstances in our life are in  
their right place and order, we understand simultaneously also that law of God  
rules our whole life (ego-based, false little life) and circumstances. When  
we subsequently realise that our life is actually lived in God or the Self, we  
realise that nothing can be excluded from that Law. WE THEN KNOW THAT OUR  
INTERNAL AS WELL AS EXTERNAL NATURE ARE BOUND BY THE LAW OF GOD.  
But we are not the product of nature. We are the Self, now then and ever;  
and here, there and everywhere.   
Therefore, it follows from the above discussion that even when we may remain  
engaged in our daily workprofessional or household worksit will sure help to  
think of God or who we really are (Self), to recognise the Presence, within  
and without us, around us, and in our job and actions. SRI BHAGWAN HAS  
TAUGHT THAT IT HELPS GREATLY TO SEE JOB AS GODS WORK, FOR WHEN WE  
DO SO, WE FIND NEW AND BETTER WAYS OF DOING IT AND ARE BLESSED  
IN THAT DOING.   
Sri Bhagwan : The life of action need not be renounced. If you meditate for an  
hour or two everyday you can carry on with your duties. If you meditate in the  
right manner then the current of mind induced will continue to flow even in  
the midst of your work. IT IS AS THOUGH THERE WERE TWO WAYS OF  
EXPRESSING THE SAME IDEA: THE SAME LINE WHICH YOU TAKE IN MEDITATION  
WILL BE EXPRESSED IN YOUR ACTIVITIES.   
Yes, dear Sri Anand, I have deep Faith in Sri Bhagwan, and His Words of Grace  
helped me reconcile my sadhana to the active life that has been ordained for  
me.   
Thanks very much, dear Sri Anand Sundaram.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Dear Sri Krishna,   
Both practices are one and the same. Sri Bhagwan has taught that the ego or  
the I-thought cannot exist without an object (form). So, if attention is  
focussed on the subjective feeling of I or I am with such intensity that  
thoughts such as I am this or that does not arise, then the individual I  
will not be able to connect with objects. If this awareness of I is  
sustained for sufficiently long period, the individual I or the ego or the  
I-thought will vanish and in its place there will be direct experience of  
the Self.   
I-thought rises from the Self and subsides back into the Self when its  
tendency to identify with thought and objects ceases. This is why Sri Bhagwan  
taught to hold the I-thought and to trace it back to its source. Therefore,  
the implication is the same, for the Self is the Source.   
Dear Sri Krishna, whether one holds the ego or the I-thought or the  
individual I, and trace it back to its Source; or one maintains awareness of  
the I-thought until it is dissolved in the Source, that is, the Self, from  
which it came, the meaning and implication are the same.   
Self-enquiry for me has always meant to be turning Selfwards or attending to  
the Self and the Enquiry in the forms of Whence am I? and Who am I? are  
the forms of Self-attention.   
For instance in the Who am I?Sri Bhagwan teaches that if other thoughts  
rise, thereby indicating that the Self-attention has been lost, one should  
ask, To whom did they rise? It will be known to me. If one then enquires  
Who am I? the mind will turn back to its Source (Self)and then since no one  
is there to attend to the thought which had risen will subside. On the other  
hand Sri Bhagwan says in who am I? that if one resorts uninterruptedly to  
Self-remembrance, that is, remembrance of or attention to the mere feeling I  
until one attains Self, that alone will be enough.   
Sri Bhagwan: Remaining firmly in Self-abidance (Atma-nishtha) without giving  
even the least room to the rising of any thought other than the thought of  
the Self (Atma-chintanai) is surrendering oneself to God.   
Dear Sri Krishna, Atma-chintanai or the thought of the Self is nothing but the  
Self-attention.   
Sri Bhagwan: Forgetfulness must be for the selfwell, of what? Of the Self?  
Are there then two selves? Practice removes the samskaras.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Quote from Sri Ravi: What is the motivation behind Sadhana?Sri Bhagavan clearly sets this in the  
very opening lines of 'who am I'?   
Quote   
Quote   
As all jivas desire to be forever happy devoid of sorrow,as everyone has  
supreme love for oneself,as happiness is the cause of this Love(self  
love)-this happiness that is intrinsic to one and is experienced daily in deep  
sleep sans mind-to attain that happiness,one has to know oneself.   
Dear Sri Ravi,   
Sri Bhagwan taught in the very opening lines of Who am I? that since all  
living beings desire to be happy always without any misery, since in everyone  
Supreme Love exists only for oneself, and since happiness alone is the cause  
of love, in order to obtain that happiness, which is ONES VERY NATURE  
and which is experienced daily in deep sleep, where there is no mind, IT IS  
NECESSARY FOR ONE TO KNOW ONESELF. For that, Sri Bhagwan taught that the  
Enquiry in the form Who am I? alone is the principal means, MUKHYA SADHANA.   
It, therefore, follows from the above Teaching that the mind which has grasped  
rather well that the consciousness that shines as I alone is the Source of  
full and real happiness, will invariably now seek the Self. It is because of  
the natural craving for unbroken happiness of the creatures. HENCE, THE  
INTENSE LONGING FOR THE SELF BECAUSE OF ITS NATURAL CRAVING FOR  
HAPPINESS, IS INDEED THE HIGHEST FROM OF DEVOTION OR BHAKTI.   
Thanks very much, dear Sri Ravi.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

A pundit was sitting with the devotees. He came from upper India.   
Master (Sri Ramakrishna Paramhamsa) (smiling to M.): The pundit is a great  
student of the Bhagavata.   
M. and other devotees looked at the pundit.   
Master (to the pundit): Well, sir, what is Yogamaya?   
The pundit gave some sort of explanation.   
Master: Why is not Radhika called Yogamaya?   
The pundit also answered this question after a fashion.   
Master: Radika is full of unmixed sattva, the embodiment of prema. Yogamaya  
contains all the three gunassattva, rajas, and tamas; but Radhika has nothing  
but pure sattava.   
(To M.) Narendra now respects Radhika very much. he says that if anyone wants  
to know how to love Satchidananda, he can learn it from her.   
Satchidananda wanted to taste divine bliss for Itself. That is why It created  
Radhika. She was created from the person of Satchidananda Krishna.  
Satchidananda Krishna is the container, and He Himself, in the from of  
Radhika, is the contained. He manifested Himself in that way in order to  
experience divine bliss by loving Satchidananda.   
Therefore, it is written in Vaishnava books that after her birth Radhika did  
not open eyes. The idea is that she did not wish to see any human being.  
Yasoda came with Krishna in her arms to see Radhika. Only then did she open  
her eyes, to behold Krishna. In a playful mood Krishna touched her eyes. Have  
not you seen this? Small children touch others eyes with their hands.

Anilbhai,I do not practice vichara.I agree with what you have stated that  
Devotion carries one deep into oneself.   
As for Sri Bhagavan's 'who am I'?,as I understand it-it is to train the  
attention on the root thought 'I'-questioning its very presence.It was not  
there in sleep;it is now there on waking up.This searchlight of uninterrupted  
attention on this 'I' feeling and questioning its very presence,Sri Bhagavan  
seems to say(as I understand) undermines it,and in its place there is the  
unnameable-the source or Being.   
As I understand,Sri Bhagavan has recommended the 'who am I?' as an enquiry-so  
that one does not get stuck in a 'Status Quo' position when the mind is  
relatively quiet.He wants the seeker to keep up the intensity and not relent  
until the mind returns to the source and is resolved there in.   
Alternatively,he has suggested the path of surrender-and this is what you have  
mentioned in your quote.Either way,one has to get rid of the 'I', -the chit-  
jada granthi.   
Devotees who are attracted to vichara and practise it would do well to read  
Sri Bhagavan's works, read it over and over again and invoke his grace and  
guidance.   
Namaskar.

Friends,   
An excerpt from The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna: THE YOUNGER NAREN: "Sir, have we any free will?"   
MASTER: " _Just try to find out who this 'I' is. While you are searching for  
'I', 'He' comes out. _ 'I am the machine and He is the Operator.' You have  
heard of a mechanical toy that goes into a store with a letter in its hand.  
You are like that toy. God alone is the Doer. Do your duties in the world as  
if you were the doer, but knowing all the time that God alone is the Doer and  
you are the instrument.   
"As long as the upadhi exists there is ignorance. 'I am a scholar', 'I am a  
jnani', 'I am wealthy', 'I am honourable', 'I am the master, father, and  
teacher' -all these ideas are begotten of ignorance. 'I am the machine and You  
are the Operator' \- that is Knowledge. _In the state of Knowledge all upadhis  
are destroyed. When the log is burnt up entirely, there is no more sound; no  
heat either. Everything cools down. Peace! Peace! Peace!_   
Namaskar.

Dear Anand,   
I asked David Godman long back proof's for Maharishee's endorsement of this I  
am feeling and self attention stuff. He indeed quoted some dialogues and sent  
me.   
Now what it seems to me is,self enquiry is a mystical tool -- not everybody is  
going to get appealed to the same mode of practice. Only common parameter  
where everybody agree is, to be sure on what is not a self enquiry method  
(for eg, Bhagavan's Self. Enquiry is definitely not neti neti approach, it is  
not defininitely a mantra repition, it is not definitely a bhava meditation,   
one should not answer who am i by saying I am He or I am Brahman, one should  
not concentrate on right hand side of the chest as Heart etc.)   
in all this everybody will agree to define clearly what it is not.   
But what is self enquiry will remain a mystery, deep inside if you go  
practicing it, I think Self Enquiry is going to be revealing itself in one of  
the many variant forms of the standard structure of ways available.   
In that context, I think you are the best judge on what variant you can adopt  
(ofcourse you cannot take one of the non Self. Enq. ways like neti neti and  
claim that it is what you interpret)   
but within allowed right interpretations, what is going to appeal to you and  
how you are going to ultimately grasp the meaning will be a mystery only  
knowable to you. nobody else however great sadhaka of self enquiry will be  
able to answer or convince you (me too )

Quote from Sri Anand Sundaram: Can we continue the practice of "To whom are these thoughts, to me, who am I  
" even after the mind has achieved relative quiescence till the last concept  
dies down as mentioned in "Who am I" or is it better to try to alternate above  
practice with "self abidance " in the form of concentrating on the "I am"  
feeling.   
Dear Sri Anand Sundaram,   
Sri Bhagwan has taught that keeping always the mind (attention) fixed in the  
Self (in the feeling I) is called Self-enquiry. So, such a firm fixing of  
our attention on the Self alone is Self-enquiry.   
Remaining firmly in Self-abidance, without giving even the least room to the  
rising of any thought other than the thought of the Self is surrendering  
oneself to God.    
Therefore, all we have to do is to practice to be just still (Summa Iru) with  
the remembrance of the I-consciousness or the feeling I. We should remain  
vigilant and not give even the least room to the rising of any thought. The  
rise of a thought is itself an indication that the Self-attention has  
slackened. The rise of a thought simply means that our Self-attention has been  
lost. So, only to win back our attention from the thought that Sri Bhagwan  
taught to ask, To whom do these thoughts have come?, the answer will be To  
me and then to ask Who am I? Therefore, it follows that this form of the  
enquiry is only a contrivance to win back the lost Self-attention from the  
thought.   
Dear Sri Anand, Sri Bhagwan has taught that the Self-enquiry is not sitting  
down for hours together and doing japa of Who am I? mentally or vocally. We  
need to dive within. And diving within is to hold the I-consciousness and  
thereby gaining greater and greater concentration, clarity and stillness.  
Merely to keep on questioning is not the Self-enquiry or the Self-attention.  
We need to penetrate the thought-waves on the surface and attend to the being-  
consciousness by diving deep within. We are not supposed to endlessly repeat  
To whom?, To me, and Who am I? sequence. SOMETIMES SOME DEVOTEES  
EVEN WAIT FOR THE NEXT THOUGHT TO RISE SO THAT THEY CAN FIRE  
THESE QUESTIONS AT IT ! This is simply ridiculous, to say the least!   
Therefore, it follows from the above discussion that if only we move away from  
the Self (Self-abidance or the Self-attention) and go back to mind and  
identify with a risen thought that we have to enquire again and go back to our  
Self. WHEN WE FORGET THE STATE OF BEING OURSELVES, THEN IS THE TIME TO  
ENQUIRE, WHO HAS FORGOTTEN THE SELF AND WHO IS HAVING DOUBT AND  
CONFUSION, WHO AM I? ENQUIRING IN THIS WAY WE NEED TO COME AGAIN  
TO OURSELVES EVERYTIME OUR VIGILLANCE IN SELF-ATTENTION IS LOST.   
Remember: If we remain as the Self, there is neither the body nor the mind  
which says I. Who is this I? Sri Bhagwan has taught that it is neither the  
body nor the mind. So, What is this I after all? WE NEED TO ENQUIRE AND  
FIND OUT FOR OURSELVES.   
Thanks very much, dear Sri Anand.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Dear Sri Ravi,   
Ji. Yes. Thanks very much, sir. Sri Bhagwan has taught that the mind is  
nothing other than the I-thought. Therefore, if we maintain awareness of the  
I-thought or the feeling I relentlessly, it is dissolved in the Source  
from where it arose. It is dissolved in its Source because it has no being, it  
is unreal. It is said to be resolved in the Source the same way as the snake  
is resolved into the substratum, that is, the rope, on investigation.   
Dear Sri Ravi, why should only those devotees who are attracted to Vichara and  
practice it read Sri Bhagwans Works? I have always felt that not only those  
who are drawn to Vichara, not only devotees of Sri Bhagwan, but any earnest  
devotee who wishes to take to a spiritual discipline and desires to live a  
spiritual life must read Sri Bhagwans Works.   
Thanks very much, sir.

Indeed yes.Not all works of Sri Bhagavan are easily accessible to one and all-  
for instance Ulladu Narpadhu.On the other hand the Akshara Mana  
malai,Arunachala Pancharatnam,Appalam pattu,Atma Vidya Keertanam are among the  
most loved of his works.   
For Guidance on self -enquiry,'nan yar' alone will do.There is nothing that is  
not covered there.   
The Atma Vidya Keertanam is a favourite of mine as also Akshara Mana  
Malai.Among the Reminiscences on Sri Bhagavan-Letters from Sri Ramanasramam  
,At the Feet of Bhagavan are the ones I treasure most.

Sri Bhagwan: There is happiness at agreeable sights. It is the happiness  
inherent in the Self. That happiness is not alien and afar. You are diving  
into the pure Self on occasions which you consider pleasurable. That diving  
results in Self-existent bliss. But the association of ideas is responsible  
for foisting this bliss on other things or happenings. In fact, it is within  
you. On these occasions, you are plunging into the Self, though unconsciously.  
If you do so consciously, you call it realization. I want you to dive  
consciously into the Self, i.e. into Heart.   
The querent does not agree with me. He asked how to realize Self and when I  
told him, he was not satisfied, because I gave him the simple truth. He wants  
something unusual and unnecessary. So the best thing for me is to keep  
silence. Let him try his own methods.   
Source: Conscious Immortality   
Dear Devotees,   
As the association of ideas is responsible for foisting the Self-existent  
bliss on the external objects and happenings, likewise, we attribute to the  
happenings in mundane life the cause of all our miseries, which, in fact, is  
due to the ego within us. Therefore, it is crystal-clear from the above  
Teaching that we cannot get happiness from things and happenings extraneous to  
us. At the agreeable sights and happenings, or when an object of desire is  
obtained, we momentarily dive into the Self though we are not conscious of  
this plunging, nevertheless, we experience the bliss of the Real Identity,  
that is, of the Atma-swarupa, albeit, for a brief while. This experience of  
the bliss of the Swarupa cannot be everlasting because, we again rise as the  
ego with its myriad thoughts and miseries. However, it is thus established  
that we do not really derive happiness, not even in the least, from the things  
or events extraneous to us. It is within as One with and as the very nature  
of the Self or the Swarupa. It is therefore always the bliss of the Swarupa  
but we erroneously associate that bliss with the external objects and  
amicable happenings outside, and think and say that we experience joy after  
the fulfillment of this and that desire., with agreeable outcome of this and  
that event and obtainment of this and that object. But obviously all this is  
simply not true. Isn't it?   
Hence, the Teaching: TO BE THE SELF THAT YOU REALLY ARE IS THE ONLY  
MEANS TO REALIZE THE BLISS THAT IS EVER YOURS.   
So, Sri Bhagwan unrelentingly exhorts us to dive into Atma-swarupa  
consciously, and be the Self that we always are, and realize the bliss of the  
Real Identity forever, remaining as the Self.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

The abundant greatness of Brahman is that it cannot be made to shine by all

and precious silence of the Guru, that mauna-discourse is ever going on  
unobstructed, and remains as potent, if not more, after the dissolution of the  
mortal coil, as before.   
As soon as a discerning devotee enters Sri Ramanasramam, he experiences that  
unceasing eloquence, the best language, the Silence of the Self, His Presence  
at once. Does he not? So, yes, many devotees in Sri Ramanarasramam are in  
profound state of enquiry without mental activity. Therefore, when hearts are  
attuned to that eternal speech, IN HEART TO HEART TALK, spoken words  
obstruct this mute language. The perennial language of the Silence, which is  
so intensely palpable in the environment, is interrupted by speaking.   
Besides, since the non-dual Supreme Reality, the Atma-swarupa is the  
Transcendental Silence, Sri Bhagwan has taught that whichever path is accepted  
by a devotee, the doorway to final liberation, the ultimate entry point and  
refuge, is the intense activity called Mauna or Silence.   
Last not but the least: Mauna or Silence, which is merely the state of Grace,  
is the one imperishable letter, always shining of its own accord as the Self  
or Swarupa in the Heart.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

The Self is like a powerful magnet within us. It draws us gradually to itself,  
though we imagine we are going to it of our own accord. When we are near  
enough, it puts an end to our other activities, makes us still, and swallows  
up our own personal current, thus killing our personality. It overwhelms the  
intellect and over floods the whole being. We think we are meditating upon it  
and developing towards it, whereas the truth is that we are as iron fillings  
and it is the Atman-magnet that ius pulling us towards itself. This the  
process of finding Self is form of Divine Magnetism.   
It is necessary to practice meditation frequently and regularly until the  
condition induced becomes habitual and permanent throughout the day. Therefore  
meditate.   
You lost sight of the bliss because your meditative attitude had not become  
natural and because of the recurrence of vasanas. WHEN YOU BECOME  
HABITUALLY REFLECTIVE, THE ENJOYMENT OF SPIRITUAL BEATITUDE BECOMES A  
MATTER OF NATURAL EXPERIENCE.   
Source: Conscious Immortality   
Dear Devotees,   
When one practices meditation frequently and regularly, with perseverance, he  
begins to recognize, and contacts the Consciousness, during the meditation or  
the Enquiry. This is what is meant by the 'condition induced', which, if one  
perseveres in this practice, it becomes habitual and permanent, and such a  
one, I am sure, always remains just aware of this 'induced condition' as the  
'current of meditation', at the back of one's mind, even while one is  
intensely engaged in worldly duties. It is worth remembering here that knowing  
requires a subject and an object, but remaining just aware does not require to  
bring in subject-object relationship, for it is, in my view, purely subjective  
awareness without an object. This is a clue which can indeed help a sadhak  
understand, grasp and experience the non-dual state, or state of being, or  
state of being-awareness.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Devotee Sri Kanakammal, who has joyfully shared her experiences in everal  
books and interviews, recollected: Sometimes, Bhagwan would be gazing at something through the window in the  
hall. At those times, Bhagwan's gaze would be steady and unwavering. Once, a  
devotee asked Bhagwan, 'What is it that you are looking at, Bhagwan? Is it  
Light? Or is it Arunachala?' To this query, Bhagwan replied, 'Is that what you  
want to know? I am looking at myself. There is, after all, nothing other than  
myself.' Thus, Bhagwan has stated unequivocally, the essence of the theory of  
non-duality (abheda-bhavam).   
Source: Worshipping the Divine Oneness of Arunachala-Ramana   
Dear devotees, there is nothing other than ourselves, and at whatever things  
or objects--sentient or insentient we are looking at, in truth, we are  
looking at ourselves only. It is wonderful! If we discern and grasp this, this  
is also a great clue.   
Pranam,

Sri Arthur Osborne (from his editorial in the Mountain Path): In Hinduism, Budhism and Islam, although not in Christianity, the most widely  
used bhakti technique is invocation of the name of God. "The simplest method  
is chanting the name and freeing the mind from restlessness," said Swami  
Ramdas, a great modern bhakta.   
The Maharshi also offered His devotees the path of devotion as an alternative  
to Self-enquiry in the first place, but if devotees complained that they found  
this too difficult, He would often add, "There are two ways: ask yourself 'Who  
am I?' or submit." And indeed, many of His devotees did, and still do, follow  
Him by the path of love, surrender, devotion. Even in this case, however, He  
did not give an invocation but only prescribed (as did Sai Baba also) complete  
surrender to the Guru. He has been known to make a tremendous statement,  
"Submit to me and I will strike down the mind." Or, "only be still and I  
will do the rest."   
It is not easy thing to keep the mind still, without thoughts, or to submit as  
Bhagwan understood submission. When one does, the barrier to Truth, God, Self  
is weakened, and Bhagwan does indeed break through and strike down the  
impostor ego. But what an assurance to receive! And what power in Him who gave  
it!   
Surrender has to be complete: not only surrender of all the ego's desires but  
the ego that has the desires, until in the end it turns out to be an illusory  
thing, and bhakti becomes jnana.   
Whichever path one follows, the thing is to follow it, not to argue about it.  
A Christian priest once told Bhagwan that he considered the goal of mystic  
union envisaged by Christians to be different from the Hindu goal of Moksha  
and superior to it, and Bhagwan replied, "All right, attain that first and  
then see whether you still find any difference or anything to criticize." That  
was always His reply--to turn the critic from theory to practice. Argument did  
not interest Him, only understanding and sincere effort.   
Source: For Those With Little Dust, Selected Writings of Arthur Osborne   
Dear Devotees,   
This is indeed an extraordinary and tremendous statement to make: "Submit to  
me and I will strike down the mind." Or, "only be still and I will do the  
rest." In my knowledge, only Lord of Gita made such an open and bold assertion  
before, and thus assured the mankind: 'Sarva-dharma parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja   
Ahma tvasarva-papebhyo moksayisyami ma sucah'   
Abandoning dependence on all Dahrmas (or on human efforts at moral and  
spiritual upliftment), come to Me as the only Refuge. Grieve not; I will  
deliver you from all sins.   
V. 18-66, Srimad Bhagavad Gita   
Dear devotees, this is what is meant by the Teaching: Submit to Me and I shall  
strike down the mind. This alone is indeed the complete surrender Sri Bhagwan  
speaks of.   
I also do not see any scope for argument in the realm of spirituality.  
Argument is made only to score point, or to defeat someone in debate, which is  
detrimental from the point of view of a sincere and earnest, spiritual sadhak.  
Seeking and endeavoring to follow Sri Bhagwan and His Teaching in spirit and  
letter, I wish to say the same to all those who come and argue here about some  
other paths or methods of their preference: One should attain first and then  
see whether one still finds any difference or anything to criticize. I am  
sure only underlying unity will be found. Therefore, in my view, what matters  
most in spiritual life is understanding and sincere and earnest effort with  
Faith or Shradha.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,

Kayakanta Ganapati Muni, poet-seer, sings rapturously: "In speech He is  
extremely soft, in look cool and compassionate; His face is like full-blown  
lotus; His mind is a void like the moon in daylight; He shines in the heart as  
the sun in the sky". (Sri Ramana Gita, Ch.18, V. 16).   
The poet-saint Muruganar goes into ecstasy: In the sovereign Presence where prevails   
The stillness of awareness,   
..................................................................   
Those who enter the circle lit   
By the silent guru's grace unfailing   
Feast on the fruit of bliss eternal   
Far, far beyond the ego's reach   
To live the Truth is the true essence of religion, not preaching it. "The  
Indian tradition has been kept alive by such sages, the living embodiments of  
God-centred life, perfect images of the life divine in the mirror of human  
existence", affirms Dr. S. Radhakrishnan. Ramana lived the Truth, since He was  
the timeless in time.

so also the individuals during sleep lose their

THE EVIL GHOST   
In the heart--pure being: 'Isness alone is.'   
Outwardly--flow of events: 'A dance, a rhythm.'   
Between--an evil ghost: 'The impostor me,'   
Who seems the very hub and first of things,   
But, scrutinized, dissolves and is not there.   
Pure being in the heart   
Be this, be still;   
Flow of events without--cognise, accept;   
The evil ghost--be vigilant, expel;   
This is the path and all the wisdom of it.

Dear Devotees,   
If you have not read the story of rationalist Sri Prabhakar, as to how he was  
drawn or summoned, how he became the recipient of abundant Grace, how in a  
trice he became a full-fledged bhakta, and how he was initiated into Vichara,  
please go through this beautiful story narrated beautifully by none other than  
Sri V. Ganesan, as following: Sri Prabhakar came to Bhagwan in 1949. The story of how he came to the master  
is of absorbing interest. Prabhakar was a pure rationalist and was averse to  
anything spiritual. Though he had heard about Bhagwan and seen His photos, he  
ignored Him. However, a total change in his life took place suddenly. One  
night, Bhagwan appeared in his dream. In that dream his boss pointed to  
Bhagwan and asked him whether he knew Him. On replying in the negative,  
Prabhakar was told that that He was none other than Bhagwan Sri Ramana  
Maharshi and that he should go to Arunachala and have His Darshan. Prabhakar  
proudly replied that he felt no such need and in any case he had no money to  
travel. His boss offered to give him the required money. He said: 'I will need  
Rs. 60' At this, he woke up from his dream.   
He hesitated to narrate this dream to his boss, though he did to one of his  
friends. Prabhakar was persuaded by his friends to approach his boss with his  
dream story. One day he picked up courage and fully narrated his dream to his  
boss (avoiding the portion dealing with money). The boss was unmoved. He said: 'Anyhow, pay attention to your job and thus save some extra money to pay for  
your trip to your Bhagwan'. Before Prabhakar tried to move away, there was a  
sudden change in his boss's attitude and he hastened to add: 'Do you yourself  
have a deep desire to visit Bhagwan?' On Prabhakar replying in the  
affirmative, his boss asked him how much money he would require. Even before  
Prabhakar opened his mouth to reply, his boss wrote a cheque for Rs. 60 and  
handed it over to him! Receiving the exact amount indicated in the dream,  
Prabhakar saw that it was all Sri Bhagwna's Grace and immediately left for  
Tiruvannamalai. More thrilling than all these happenings was the fact that  
Bhagwan was looking intently at the entrance to the Hall as if waiting for  
someone to arrive and as soon as Prabhakar entered He gave a nod! For the  
first time in his life, Prabhakar did sashtanga namaskar (full prostration) to  
a great man. At his very first glimpse of Sri Bhagwan he became a full-fledged  
bhakta!   
He asked Bhagwan: 'Did you summon me?' Bhagwan nodded His head in assent. He  
repeated the question twice; Bhagwan nodded each time. This stabilized  
Prabhakar's bondage to Bhagwan. During his stay he used to ask questions and  
Bhagwan would reply to every one of them. Once, Bhagwan told him: "You say 'I  
am Prabhakar'; who is this Prabhakar? Your parents called you so; you being a  
rationalist, why should you accept it? Who is this Prabhakar?. Use your  
reasoning faculty and search for 'who you really are'. Then, Prabhakar of this  
particular form and name will drop off and the real being alone will shine.  
The wrong thought that you are the sufferer of all these troubles will cease  
once for all."   
In spite of odds and obstacles, Prabhakar led a peaceful life, because of his  
faith in and devotion to Bhagwan. He composed Prapatti Satkam in Sanskrit, a  
language in which he was not well-versed. Many corrections were made and  
Bhagwan had it included in the collection of poems preserved in the Asharam  
archives. It has a very moving beginning: "The fullness of my devotion to You,  
Oh Bhagwan, is due not to the excellence of my reasoning power or my spiritual  
maturity, but only to the luster that You shed on me in such abundance!"   
Source: Moments Remembered   
Dear devotees, how can a rationalist worth name accept blindly that he is this  
insentient body named so and so, only because others believe so and say the  
same? How can he accept that this block of a body shine as 'I'? He will  
naturally use his reasoning faculty and reason out his waking, dream and sleep  
experiences, and reach gradually the right understanding.   
Sri Prabhakar's story is the ample proof of the saying that a devotee cannot  
fathom as to how much solicitude the Guru has for him, and it is indeed Guru's  
work to make a call to a devotee whose time has come! How can a devotee seek  
his Guru and where? What does he know?   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

From Sri Arthur Osborne's Editorials in the Mountain path: All that one has to do is to keep one's mind still, take cognizance of outer  
happenings, concentrate on the mere fact of being, and remain poised and alert  
from promptings from within. It is as simple as that. But, although simple,  
few people find it easy. There is the temptation, while shaving or while  
stirring the porridge, to let the mind ramble on incessantly over what I will  
say to George in the office, and so on. These ramblings have two features in  
common: one is that they centre around a character called 'I' by whose  
interest the good and evil, advantage and disadvantage of all events are  
measured and whom the Sages declare to be fictitious; and the other is that  
they add nothing to the success of that presumptive character but merely mull  
over what has already been decided or will have to be decided in due course.  
They have the disastrous effect of deafening the mind to the still small voice  
of the Self and preventing the spiritual intuition or awareness of the Self  
from flowing in, so that the presumptive 'I', like an evil ghost, seems to  
usurp the place of the Self.   
Dear Devotees,   
Yes, these rambling and chirping of the mind during the waking hours have the  
disastrous consequences of blocking the mind to the still feeble Voice of the  
Self, still feeble voice because the sadhana has yet not stabilized, and thus  
these ramblings effectively prevent the spiritual intuition or the awareness  
of the Self from flowing in. However as sadhana progresses, and as the mind  
begins to be stilled to a greater or lesser degrees, and for longer and  
shorter periods, the obstacle to His Grace is gradually removed, barrier to  
spiritual intuition or awareness of the Self begins to be breached, and it  
begins to flow in, first it trickles in, then avalanche of spiritual knowledge  
floods in. At this stage, sadhana is stabilized, mental thought-wave is almost  
off, Source-awareness is bestowed leading to Self-abidance; and the Self-  
abidance, free of thought-wave, is the real Self-enquiry Sri Bhagwan speaks  
of. Self Itself then destroys the residual predispositions, and when the  
mind is thus purified, it comprehends or reflects the Self or Brahman  
perfectly, that is, the Self or Swarupa shines alone. THIS IS THE WISDOM-  
QUEST AND ALL THE WISDOM OF IT, AS SANG SRI OSBORNE!   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,

Dear Devotees,   
An old Devotee, Sri Dhiruben Patel, an acclaimed Gujarati novelist, came to  
Sri Bhagwan as a teenager, and returning after fifty-seven years to Sri  
Ramanasramam, after disappearance of Sri Bhagwan's mortal coil, she has  
written thus: After fifty-seven years,   
I enter your Ashram once again.   
I do not miss You   
Because You were with me   
All the while.   
But where are Your squirrels,   
Or their children of the twenty-seventh generation?   
Surely they miss their peanuts   
And touch of Your lotus-soft fingers?   
Perhaps You have also been with them   
And the peacocks trumpeting from the heights!   
You cannot be away from them or from any other place.   
You are the universal Consciousness,   
Existence and joy eternal, O Ramana!   
Dear devotees, Sri Kunju Swami often used to tell devotees in his Satsang in  
Sri Ramanasramam: "Bhagwan is the supreme example of the Self acting as the Guru. He lived as  
though He had no body. And now too, there is no body. But He is present  
forever as the inner Guru in our Hearts as the Self within and as Arunachala,  
the visible symbol of the Self."   
Dear devotees, it is unique in the annals of spiritual history. Is it not?  
Lord Sri Arunachala Himself incarnated as the Sadguru Bhagwan Sri Ramana.  
However, when the Purpose of His Advent was over, He visibly merged again with  
Lord Sri Arunachala! Everyone present at the time of His Mahasamadhi, so many  
people in South India and even Western journalists are witness to that great  
celestial and divine event. Though Sri Arunachala-- Ramana, Parmatamam, in  
truth, is the Inner Self in the hearts of all, for His devotees, His outward  
manifestation and visibility as the Hill will remain forever, guiding them on  
the path to liberation. Lord Sri Arunachala, therefore, is His visible support  
of Grace for people at large in general and for His devotees in particular.   
Thanks very much.   
 Pranam,   
 Anil

Sri Bhagwan: Let the sensible man consider if he knew his body in deep sleep.  
Why does he feel it in the waking state? But, although the body was not felt  
in sleep, did not the Self exist then? How was he in deep sleep? How is he  
when awake? What is the difference? Ego rises up and that is waking.  
Simultaneously thoughts arise. Let him find out to whom are the thoughts.  
Wherefrom do they arise? They must spring up from the conscious Self.  
APPREHENDING IT EVEN VAGUELY HELPS THE EXTINCTION OF THE EGO.  
Thereafter the realization of the one Infinite Existence becomes possible. In  
that state there are no individuals other than the Eternal Existence.   
Talk--80   
Dear Devotees,   
Body changes but I am the same. Thoughts arise which pass through the mind and  
go out, leaving me the same as I have been before the thoughts arose and  
passed through my mind. Some time back, I had particular thoughts, emotions,  
hopes, despair, etc., which are gone now, but still I am the same. What or Who  
am I? 'Where did this thought come from, and why, and to whom?' Thoughts are  
like clouds and they pass away like clouds across a clear sky.   
Dear devotees, after some practice in this way, Enquiry awakens a current of  
awareness, a consciousness of 'I' in the Heart, and this is not the ego-sense  
but a feeling of the essential 'I', which is none other than the All-pervading  
Self or God Himself who remains unaffected by passage of thoughts, good or ill  
fortune or whatever comes in and goes away. This current of awareness, once  
apprehended, even vaguely, must be developed by constant effort until it  
becomes more and more frequent and finally a constant undertone to all the  
activities of life, much like the primary, shruti note in a musical  
performance, which plays constantly while other notes may rise and fall.   
Therefore, one should first awaken the awareness of the Self or the Heart,  
even by beginning occasionally and imperfectly, but increasingly more  
constantly and powerfully, and ultimately being the Self. Knowing or realizing  
the Self is being the Self that we always are. Yes, apprehending it even  
vaguely helps the extinction of the ego and discovery of the Swarupa or the  
Self.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Sri Arthur Osborne: Since Bhagwan spoke always of Knowledge and Self-enquiry when asked about the  
Goal or the way, few except those who approached Him personally realized what  
a powerful support devotion was in His Teaching. Knowledge in the ordinary  
sense of a link between knower and known is not Knowledge as He meant it. That  
Knowledge is being the self-effulgent Self. And the approach to it is through  
love as well as Self-enquiry. Self-enquiry is the mind's attempt to turn  
inwards, and it is love that draws it inwards. Knowledge of one by another and  
love for one by another are alike incomplete, but in their perfection Love and  
Knowledge are the same. Love for Bhagwan and Self-enquiry are the two ropes  
pulling the mind of His devotee back towards the Self.   
From Sri Osborne's Editorials in the Mountain Path   
Dear Devotees,   
Yes, there is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that love for Him in the  
devotees' hearts is indeed a very powerful support on the path of Vichara. If  
a devotee accepts Him as the Supreme Self and oneself as the seeming ego-self  
or the individual self, and enquires who he is, or surrenders completely that  
seeming-self at His Lotus Feet, which is 'I-I', He draws the mind from within  
and, and once at the Core, anchors it to the Self. Sri Bhagwan has taught that  
the removal of this sense of duality is removal of ignorance. Then only one  
realizes that the Guru is not different from himself. Then only one realizes  
that one is not the body, nor is the Guru. One is the Self and so is the  
Guru. This, in my view, is alone the real consummation of Love in which all  
difference between and Lover and Beloved is obliterated, and what remains is  
Pure Love which is the Self or God.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

"Today, we find people who have never seen Bhagwan in His physical form, never  
heard His voice or listened to His upadesa, sitting in the Old Hall or the the  
Samadhi Hall, oblivious of themselves, often shedding tears, and going round  
the hall as if impelled by some unseen force. What gives these people their  
experiences? As Bhagwan always said to His devotees, "Is this body, Bhagwan?  
No it is not." When somebody expressed sadness at having to go back home from  
the Ashram, Bhagwan said, "What am I to do? You say that this body is Bhagwan.  
I say that it is not. Now, if you insist, what am I to do?" He would,  
referring to the devotee who is reluctant to return home, "Look, He says he is  
going to a place where I am not.""   
"Yes, Bhagwan has given many indication of His Ever-present, All-pervasive  
continued Grace. Those who seek it humbly, surrendering to Him, receive the  
radiation and powerful spiritual help that Bhagwan accords them. To be  
recipient of His blessings is itself a stirring experience, an assured  
spiritual fortune in the elevation of the soul. We have to pray Arunachala-  
Ramana to be with us everywhere and all the time so that, wherever we are,  
Arunachala-Ramana is with us in our Heart, and we are ever 'At Home' with  
Bhagwan. His beloved devotees do not need anything more than what Bhagwan  
Arunachala-Ramana has graced with His loving and blessings."

Sri Bhagwan: There is happiness at agreeable sights. It is the happiness  
inherent in the Self. That happiness is not alien and afar. You are diving  
into the pure Self on occasions which you consider pleasurable. That diving  
results in Self-existent bliss. But the association of ideas is responsible  
for foisting this bliss on other things or happenings. In fact, it is within  
you. On these occasions, you are plunging into the Self, though unconsciously.  
If you do so consciously, you call it realization. I want you to dive  
consciously into the Self, i.e. into Heart.   
The querent does not agree with me. He asked how to realize Self and when I  
told him, he was not satisfied, because I gave him the simple truth. He wants  
something unusual and unnecessary. So the best thing for me is to keep  
silence. Let him try his own methods.   
Source: Conscious Immortality   
Dear Devotees,   
As the association of ideas is responsible for foisting the Self-existent  
bliss on the external objects and happenings, likewise, we attribute to the  
happenings in mundane life the cause of all our miseries, which, in fact, is  
due to the ego within us. Therefore, it is crystal-clear from the above  
Teaching that we cannot get happiness from things and happenings extraneous to  
us. At the agreeable sights and happenings, or when an object of desire is  
obtained, we momentarily dive into the Self though we are not conscious of  
this plunging, nevertheless, we experience the bliss of the Real Identity,  
that is, of the Atma-swarupa, albeit, for a brief while. This experience of  
the bliss of the Swarupa cannot be everlasting because, we again rise as the  
ego with its myriad thoughts and miseries. However, it is thus established  
that we do not really derive happiness, not even in the least, from the things  
or events extraneous to us. It is within as One with and as the very nature  
of the Self or the Swarupa. It is therefore always the bliss of the Swarupa  
but we erroneously associate that bliss with the external objects and  
amicable happenings outside, and think and say that we experience joy after  
the fulfillment of this and that desire., with agreeable outcome of this and  
that event and obtainment of this and that object. But obviously all this is  
simply not true. Isn't it?   
Hence, the Teaching: TO BE THE SELF THAT YOU REALLY ARE IS THE ONLY  
MEANS TO REALIZE THE BLISS THAT IS EVER YOURS.   
So, Sri Bhagwan unrelentingly exhorts us to dive into Atma-swarupa  
consciously, and be the Self that we always are, and realize the bliss of the  
Real Identity forever, remaining as the Self.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

The abundant greatness of Brahman is that it cannot be made to shine by all  
the various utterances, expositions and lectures. Because that Brahman shines  
through the rare and precious silence of the Guru, that mauna-discourse is the  
most powerful exposition.   
GVK   
Dear Sri Jewel and Devotees,   
Sri Bhagwan's last Holy Utterance 'I AM HERE', in my view, implies that rare  
and precious silence of the Guru, that mauna-discourse is ever going on  
unobstructed, and remains as potent, if not more, after the dissolution of the  
mortal coil, as before.   
As soon as a discerning devotee enters Sri Ramanasramam, he experiences that  
unceasing eloquence, the best language, the Silence of the Self, His Presence  
at once. Does he not? So, yes, many devotees in Sri Ramanarasramam are in  
profound state of enquiry without mental activity. Therefore, when hearts are  
attuned to that eternal speech, IN HEART TO HEART TALK, spoken words  
obstruct this mute language. The perennial language of the Silence, which is  
so intensely palpable in the environment, is interrupted by speaking.   
Besides, since the non-dual Supreme Reality, the Atma-swarupa is the  
Transcendental Silence, Sri Bhagwan has taught that whichever path is accepted  
by a devotee, the doorway to final liberation, the ultimate entry point and  
refuge, is the intense activity called Mauna or Silence.   
Last not but the least: Mauna or Silence, which is merely the state of Grace,  
is the one imperishable letter, always shining of its own accord as the Self  
or Swarupa in the Heart.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

The Self is like a powerful magnet within us. It draws us gradually to itself,  
though we imagine we are going to it of our own accord. When we are near  
enough, it puts an end to our other activities, makes us still, and swallows  
up our own personal current, thus killing our personality. It overwhelms the  
intellect and over floods the whole being. We think we are meditating upon it  
and developing towards it, whereas the truth is that we are as iron fillings  
and it is the Atman-magnet that ius pulling us towards itself. This the  
process of finding Self is form of Divine Magnetism.   
It is necessary to practice meditation frequently and regularly until the  
condition induced becomes habitual and permanent throughout the day. Therefore  
meditate.   
You lost sight of the bliss because your meditative attitude had not become  
natural and because of the recurrence of vasanas. WHEN YOU BECOME  
HABITUALLY REFLECTIVE, THE ENJOYMENT OF SPIRITUAL BEATITUDE BECOMES A  
MATTER OF NATURAL EXPERIENCE.   
Source: Conscious Immortality   
Dear Devotees,   
When one practices meditation frequently and regularly, with perseverance, he  
begins to recognize, and contacts the Consciousness, during the meditation or  
the Enquiry. This is what is meant by the 'condition induced', which, if one  
perseveres in this practice, it becomes habitual and permanent, and such a  
one, I am sure, always remains just aware of this 'induced condition' as the  
'current of meditation', at the back of one's mind, even while one is  
intensely engaged in worldly duties. It is worth remembering here that knowing  
requires a subject and an object, but remaining just aware does not require to  
bring in subject-object relationship, for it is, in my view, purely subjective  
awareness without an object. This is a clue which can indeed help a sadhak  
understand, grasp and experience the non-dual state, or state of being, or  
state of being-awareness.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,

Devotee Sri Kanakammal, who has joyfully shared her experiences in everal  
books and interviews, recollected: Sometimes, Bhagwan would be gazing at something through the window in the  
hall. At those times, Bhagwan's gaze would be steady and unwavering. Once, a  
devotee asked Bhagwan, 'What is it that you are looking at, Bhagwan? Is it  
Light? Or is it Arunachala?' To this query, Bhagwan replied, 'Is that what you  
want to know? I am looking at myself. There is, after all, nothing other than  
myself.' Thus, Bhagwan has stated unequivocally, the essence of the theory of  
non-duality (abheda-bhavam).   
Source: Worshipping the Divine Oneness of Arunachala-Ramana   
Dear devotees, there is nothing other than ourselves, and at whatever things  
or objects--sentient or insentient we are looking at, in truth, we are  
looking at ourselves only. It is wonderful! If we discern and grasp this, this  
is also a great clue.

Sri Arthur Osborne (from his editorial in the Mountain Path): In Hinduism, Budhism and Islam, although not in Christianity, the most widely  
used bhakti technique is invocation of the name of God. "The simplest method  
is chanting the name and freeing the mind from restlessness," said Swami  
Ramdas, a great modern bhakta.   
The Maharshi also offered His devotees the path of devotion as an alternative  
to Self-enquiry in the first place, but if devotees complained that they found  
this too difficult, He would often add, "There are two ways: ask yourself 'Who  
am I?' or submit." And indeed, many of His devotees did, and still do, follow  
Him by the path of love, surrender, devotion. Even in this case, however, He  
did not give an invocation but only prescribed (as did Sai Baba also) complete  
surrender to the Guru. He has been known to make a tremendous statement,  
"Submit to me and I will strike down the mind." Or, "only be still and I  
will do the rest."   
It is not easy thing to keep the mind still, without thoughts, or to submit as  
Bhagwan understood submission. When one does, the barrier to Truth, God, Self  
is weakened, and Bhagwan does indeed break through and strike down the  
impostor ego. But what an assurance to receive! And what power in Him who gave  
it!   
Surrender has to be complete: not only surrender of all the ego's desires but  
the ego that has the desires, until in the end it turns out to be an illusory  
thing, and bhakti becomes jnana.   
Whichever path one follows, the thing is to follow it, not to argue about it.  
A Christian priest once told Bhagwan that he considered the goal of mystic  
union envisaged by Christians to be different from the Hindu goal of Moksha  
and superior to it, and Bhagwan replied, "All right, attain that first and  
then see whether you still find any difference or anything to criticize." That  
was always His reply--to turn the critic from theory to practice. Argument did  
not interest Him, only understanding and sincere effort.   
Source: For Those With Little Dust, Selected Writings of Arthur Osborne   
Dear Devotees,   
This is indeed an extraordinary and tremendous statement to make: "Submit to  
me and I will strike down the mind." Or, "only be still and I will do the  
rest." In my knowledge, only Lord of Gita made such an open and bold assertion  
before, and thus assured the mankind: 'Sarva-dharma parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja   
Ahma tvasarva-papebhyo moksayisyami ma sucah'   
Abandoning dependence on all Dahrmas (or on human efforts at moral and  
spiritual upliftment), come to Me as the only Refuge. Grieve not; I will  
deliver you from all sins.   
V. 18-66, Srimad Bhagavad Gita   
Dear devotees, this is what is meant by the Teaching: Submit to Me and I shall  
strike down the mind. This alone is indeed the complete surrender Sri Bhagwan  
speaks of.   
I also do not see any scope for argument in the realm of spirituality.  
Argument is made only to score point, or to defeat someone in debate, which is  
detrimental from the point of view of a sincere and earnest, spiritual sadhak.  
Seeking and endeavoring to follow Sri Bhagwan and His Teaching in spirit and  
letter, I wish to say the same to all those who come and argue here about some  
other paths or methods of their preference: One should attain first and then  
see whether one still finds any difference or anything to criticize. I am  
sure only underlying unity will be found. Therefore, in my view, what matters  
most in spiritual life is understanding and sincere and earnest effort with  
Faith or Shradha.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,

THE EVIL GHOST   
In the heart--pure being: 'Isness alone is.'   
Outwardly--flow of events: 'A dance, a rhythm.'   
Between--an evil ghost: 'The impostor me,'   
Who seems the very hub and first of things,   
But, scrutinized, dissolves and is not there.   
Pure being in the heart   
Be this, be still;   
Flow of events without--cognise, accept;   
The evil ghost--be vigilant, expel;   
This is the path and all the wisdom of it.   
Sri Arthur Osborne

Dear Devotees,   
If you have not read the story of rationalist Sri Prabhakar, as to how he was  
drawn or summoned, how he became the recipient of abundant Grace, how in a  
trice he became a full-fledged bhakta, and how he was initiated into Vichara,  
please go through this beautiful story narrated beautifully by none other than  
Sri V. Ganesan, as following: Sri Prabhakar came to Bhagwan in 1949. The story of how he came to the master  
is of absorbing interest. Prabhakar was a pure rationalist and was averse to  
anything spiritual. Though he had heard about Bhagwan and seen His photos, he  
ignored Him. However, a total change in his life took place suddenly. One  
night, Bhagwan appeared in his dream. In that dream his boss pointed to  
Bhagwan and asked him whether he knew Him. On replying in the negative,  
Prabhakar was told that that He was none other than Bhagwan Sri Ramana  
Maharshi and that he should go to Arunachala and have His Darshan. Prabhakar  
proudly replied that he felt no such need and in any case he had no money to  
travel. His boss offered to give him the required money. He said: 'I will need  
Rs. 60' At this, he woke up from his dream.   
He hesitated to narrate this dream to his boss, though he did to one of his  
friends. Prabhakar was persuaded by his friends to approach his boss with his  
dream story. One day he picked up courage and fully narrated his dream to his  
boss (avoiding the portion dealing with money). The boss was unmoved. He said: 'Anyhow, pay attention to your job and thus save some extra money to pay for  
your trip to your Bhagwan'. Before Prabhakar tried to move away, there was a  
sudden change in his boss's attitude and he hastened to add: 'Do you yourself  
have a deep desire to visit Bhagwan?' On Prabhakar replying in the  
affirmative, his boss asked him how much money he would require. Even before  
Prabhakar opened his mouth to reply, his boss wrote a cheque for Rs. 60 and  
handed it over to him! Receiving the exact amount indicated in the dream,  
Prabhakar saw that it was all Sri Bhagwna's Grace and immediately left for  
Tiruvannamalai. More thrilling than all these happenings was the fact that  
Bhagwan was looking intently at the entrance to the Hall as if waiting for  
someone to arrive and as soon as Prabhakar entered He gave a nod! For the  
first time in his life, Prabhakar did sashtanga namaskar (full prostration) to  
a great man. At his very first glimpse of Sri Bhagwan he became a full-fledged  
bhakta!   
He asked Bhagwan: 'Did you summon me?' Bhagwan nodded His head in assent. He  
repeated the question twice; Bhagwan nodded each time. This stabilized  
Prabhakar's bondage to Bhagwan. During his stay he used to ask questions and  
Bhagwan would reply to every one of them. Once, Bhagwan told him: "You say 'I  
am Prabhakar'; who is this Prabhakar? Your parents called you so; you being a  
rationalist, why should you accept it? Who is this Prabhakar?. Use your  
reasoning faculty and search for 'who you really are'. Then, Prabhakar of this  
particular form and name will drop off and the real being alone will shine.  
The wrong thought that you are the sufferer of all these troubles will cease  
once for all."   
In spite of odds and obstacles, Prabhakar led a peaceful life, because of his  
faith in and devotion to Bhagwan. He composed Prapatti Satkam in Sanskrit, a  
language in which he was not well-versed. Many corrections were made and  
Bhagwan had it included in the collection of poems preserved in the Asharam  
archives. It has a very moving beginning: "The fullness of my devotion to You,  
Oh Bhagwan, is due not to the excellence of my reasoning power or my spiritual  
maturity, but only to the luster that You shed on me in such abundance!"   
Source: Moments Remembered   
Dear devotees, how can a rationalist worth name accept blindly that he is this  
insentient body named so and so, only because others believe so and say the  
same? How can he accept that this block of a body shine as 'I'? He will  
naturally use his reasoning faculty and reason out his waking, dream and sleep  
experiences, and reach gradually the right understanding.   
Sri Prabhakar's story is the ample proof of the saying that a devotee cannot  
fathom as to how much solicitude the Guru has for him, and it is indeed Guru's  
work to make a call to a devotee whose time has come! How can a devotee seek  
his Guru and where? What does he know?   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

From Sri Arthur Osborne's Editorials in the Mountain path: All that one has to do is to keep one's mind still, take cognizance of outer  
happenings, concentrate on the mere fact of being, and remain poised and alert  
from promptings from within. It is as simple as that. But, although simple,  
few people find it easy. There is the temptation, while shaving or while  
stirring the porridge, to let the mind ramble on incessantly over what I will  
say to George in the office, and so on. These ramblings have two features in  
common: one is that they centre around a character called 'I' by whose  
interest the good and evil, advantage and disadvantage of all events are  
measured and whom the Sages declare to be fictitious; and the other is that  
they add nothing to the success of that presumptive character but merely mull  
over what has already been decided or will have to be decided in due course.  
They have the disastrous effect of deafening the mind to the still small voice  
of the Self and preventing the spiritual intuition or awareness of the Self  
from flowing in, so that the presumptive 'I', like an evil ghost, seems to  
usurp the place of the Self.   
Dear Devotees,   
Yes, these rambling and chirping of the mind during the waking hours have the  
disastrous consequences of blocking the mind to the still feeble Voice of the  
Self, still feeble voice because the sadhana has yet not stabilized, and thus  
these ramblings effectively prevent the spiritual intuition or the awareness  
of the Self from flowing in. However as sadhana progresses, and as the mind  
begins to be stilled to a greater or lesser degrees, and for longer and  
shorter periods, the obstacle to His Grace is gradually removed, barrier to  
spiritual intuition or awareness of the Self begins to be breached, and it  
begins to flow in, first it trickles in, then avalanche of spiritual knowledge  
floods in. At this stage, sadhana is stabilized, mental thought-wave is almost  
off, Source-awareness is bestowed leading to Self-abidance; and the Self-  
abidance, free of thought-wave, is the real Self-enquiry Sri Bhagwan speaks  
of. Self Itself then destroys the residual predispositions, and when the  
mind is thus purified, it comprehends or reflects the Self or Brahman  
perfectly, that is, the Self or Swarupa shines alone. THIS IS THE WISDOM-  
QUEST AND ALL THE WISDOM OF IT, AS SANG SRI OSBORNE!   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Dear Devotees,   
An old Devotee, Sri Dhiruben Patel, an acclaimed Gujarati novelist, came to  
Sri Bhagwan as a teenager, and returning after fifty-seven years to Sri  
Ramanasramam, after disappearance of Sri Bhagwan's mortal coil, she has  
written thus: After fifty-seven years,   
I enter your Ashram once again.   
I do not miss You   
Because You were with me   
All the while.   
But where are Your squirrels,   
Or their children of the twenty-seventh generation?   
Surely they miss their peanuts   
And touch of Your lotus-soft fingers?   
Perhaps You have also been with them   
And the peacocks trumpeting from the heights!   
You cannot be away from them or from any other place.   
You are the universal Consciousness,   
Existence and joy eternal, O Ramana!   
Dear devotees, Sri Kunju Swami often used to tell devotees in his Satsang in  
Sri Ramanasramam: "Bhagwan is the supreme example of the Self acting as the Guru. He lived as  
though He had no body. And now too, there is no body. But He is present  
forever as the inner Guru in our Hearts as the Self within and as Arunachala,  
the visible symbol of the Self."   
Dear devotees, it is unique in the annals of spiritual history. Is it not?  
Lord Sri Arunachala Himself incarnated as the Sadguru Bhagwan Sri Ramana.  
However, when the Purpose of His Advent was over, He visibly merged again with  
Lord Sri Arunachala! Everyone present at the time of His Mahasamadhi, so many  
people in South India and even Western journalists are witness to that great  
celestial and divine event. Though Sri Arunachala-- Ramana, Parmatamam, in  
truth, is the Inner Self in the hearts of all, for His devotees, His outward  
manifestation and visibility as the Hill will remain forever, guiding them on  
the path to liberation. Lord Sri Arunachala, therefore, is His visible support  
of Grace for people at large in general and for His devotees in particular.   
Thanks very much.   
 Pranam,   
 Anil

Sri Bhagwan: Let the sensible man consider if he knew his body in deep sleep.  
Why does he feel it in the waking state? But, although the body was not felt  
in sleep, did not the Self exist then? How was he in deep sleep? How is he  
when awake? What is the difference? Ego rises up and that is waking.  
Simultaneously thoughts arise. Let him find out to whom are the thoughts.  
Wherefrom do they arise? They must spring up from the conscious Self.  
APPREHENDING IT EVEN VAGUELY HELPS THE EXTINCTION OF THE EGO.  
Thereafter the realization of the one Infinite Existence becomes possible. In  
that state there are no individuals other than the Eternal Existence.   
Talk--80   
Dear Devotees,   
Body changes but I am the same. Thoughts arise which pass through the mind and  
go out, leaving me the same as I have been before the thoughts arose and  
passed through my mind. Some time back, I had particular thoughts, emotions,  
hopes, despair, etc., which are gone now, but still I am the same. What or Who  
am I? 'Where did this thought come from, and why, and to whom?' Thoughts are  
like clouds and they pass away like clouds across a clear sky.   
Dear devotees, after some practice in this way, Enquiry awakens a current of  
awareness, a consciousness of 'I' in the Heart, and this is not the ego-sense  
but a feeling of the essential 'I', which is none other than the All-pervading  
Self or God Himself who remains unaffected by passage of thoughts, good or ill  
fortune or whatever comes in and goes away. This current of awareness, once  
apprehended, even vaguely, must be developed by constant effort until it  
becomes more and more frequent and finally a constant undertone to all the  
activities of life, much like the primary, shruti note in a musical  
performance, which plays constantly while other notes may rise and fall.   
Therefore, one should first awaken the awareness of the Self or the Heart,  
even by beginning occasionally and imperfectly, but increasingly more  
constantly and powerfully, and ultimately being the Self. Knowing or realizing  
the Self is being the Self that we always are. Yes, apprehending it even  
vaguely helps the extinction of the ego and discovery of the Swarupa or the  
Self.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Dear Devotees,   
Sri Bhagwan is beyond Knowledge and ignorance, but all the same, He is of the  
nature of Knowledge.   
Sri Bhagwan is beyond intelligence and dullness, yet He is of the nature of  
Intelligence.   
Sri Bhagwan is beyond light and darkness, but undoubtedly, He is of the nature  
of Light.   
Sri Bhagwan is beyond greatness and smallness, but nevertheless, He is of the  
nature of Greatness.   
Yes, He includes all, knowledge and ignorance, intelligence and dullness,  
light and darkness, greatness and smallness, et al, yet, He transcends them  
simultaneously. No mortal can describe His State even remotely, for words  
which are employed to describe His State are only the grandsons of the  
Supreme Silence that He is. Only a Jnani who is similarly established in  
Sahaja can know and understand His State.   
Therefore, dear devotees, Sri Bhagwan is great in the same way as we say God  
is great-beyond degrees, possessive, comparative or superlative!! He is. That  
is all that can be admitted about Him!   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,

Sri Bhagwan: Sat-chit-ananda is said to indicate that the Supreme is not asat,  
not achit and not an anananda. Because we are in the phenomenal world we speak  
of the Self as sacchidananda.   
Dear Devotees,   
Sri Bhagwan has taught that God is not different from the Self. THE SELF IS  
OBJECTIFIED AS GOD AND GURU. Guru, dear devotees, is the manifestation of  
Sat. That Sat denotes, as Sri Bhagwwn has taught, BEING or Existence, beyond  
sat and asat. Chit beyond chit and achit, and Ananda beyond bliss and non-  
bliss.   
Sri Bhagwan: What is it then? Even if not sat nor asat, It must be admitted to  
be sat only. Compare the term jnana. It is the state beyond knowledge and  
ignorance. Yet jnana is not ignorance but knowledge. So also with Sat-chit-  
ananda.   
Thanks very much.

Now turning to Bhagwan's teaching, 'Who am I?' I feel, it is not merely a  
meditation technique, but a way of life. I am elated or disappointed at a turn  
of events--who am I? I am flattered or hurt by another's actions or words--who  
am I? I am impatient at the progress I am making in meditation--who is  
impatient? I am disappointed at my children not heeding my advice--who is  
disappointed?   
After practicing thus for some time, the answer begins to appear within  
oneself as a 'current of awareness', which one needs to cultivate and nurture.  
One them finds one's whole life transformed, with peace pervading every walk  
of one's life. Does it eventually lead to Self-realization? But why this doubt  
--who is the doubter? Who am I? One's job is only to persevere. Grace would  
flow in, when one is ripe enough to receive it. As Bhagwan has repeatedly  
exhorted His devotees--all that is required of one is to just 'BE', not to be  
'this or that'.   
A quote from an article named 'Guru', published in the current Mountain Path,  
authored by Sri Jayaraman Rajath Iyer   
Dear devotees, this is almost exactly what I have been telling also all along.  
Our duty is to persevere. If we persevere with earnestness, sincerity and love  
in the heart, one is standing in the huge floods of the Ganges of Grace. For,  
Awakening cannot be then faraway, and the answer to the only real question  
'Who am I?' indeed begins to appear within oneself as 'current of non-dual  
awareness', which if grasped and experienced clearly, with more and more  
practice, will invariably lead to Realization of the Atma-swarupa or the  
Self. This one needs to affirm for oneself with practice and experience. There  
is no scope for even an iota of doubt about it. Sri Bhagwan's Teaching is  
unequivocal and unambiguous regarding the above clarity.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Sri Vilacheri Ranga Iyer, Sri Bhagwan's childhood friend, has written thus: One day I told Bhagwan, "Bhagwan has no Grace for me." Bhagwan replied, "Your  
statement is like that of a man who, standing in the huge floods of the  
Ganges, complains he is thirsty, and desires a bottle of tap water may be sent  
to him from Tanjore." Bhagwan's Grace is always flowing. Those who are at  
thirst for Jnana can always go to Him and get their thirst quenched.   
I used to pester Bhagwan frequently with my questions. So, one day Bhagwan  
said, "You are always asking questions. Some devotees come, sit beside me and  
realize what alone has to be known and will go away." I replied, "What is to  
be done? If you have a dunce for your son you will have to din and din into  
his ears and teach him." Bhagwan laughed and remained silent. I realized that  
many people became jivan muktas by having Bhagwan's darshan. Who can describe  
Bhagwan's greatness.   
One day Bhagwan told me He was where speech was not. Thereupon I asked Him,  
"Why then do you speak?" "out of compassion, I have to speak", He replied. I  
realized then that Bhagwan was a Dakshinamurthy and speaks only out of  
compassion for us.

Sri Bhagwan: Jnana, once revealed takes time to steady itself. The Self is  
certainly within the direct experience of everyone, but not as one imagines it  
to be. It is only as it is. This experience is Samadhi...........   
"Having once experienced the Bliss of peace no one would like to be out of it  
or engaged himself otherwise."   
Dear Devotees,   
The Experience Sri Bhagwan speaks of is not the ordinary, worldly experience  
involving dyad of the experiencer and the experienced. When the mind remains  
thought-free even during sadhana of the Atma-vichara, having no contact with  
sense-objects, the Self is experienced as Happiness. This alone is true  
experience which is attained by a mind (pure mind which is verily Absolute  
Consciouisness) that does not arise through desires from ignorance and wander  
after sense objects, but remains calm without forgetfulness of the Self in the  
waking state, just as it does in sleep. Sri Bhaghwan has taught that the Self  
is the true, infinite Eye, and the Self is known only by that Infinite Eye,  
which, in truth, is directly experienced (aparoksha).   
Dear devotees, when we isolate the intuitive ?'' (I Am) from the 'I am so and  
so', and focus our entire attention only on 'I Am', one gradually begins to  
experience 'I Am', free from body consciousness and other adjuncts, with more  
and more clarity, which gives rise to intuition and one has the Foretaste of  
the Bliss of Peace.   
Therefore, notwithstanding some learned members' views, I wish to say that  
that these experiences are vital on the path of the Atma-vichara, which nudges  
and encourages the sadhakas to pursue the sadhana till the very end.   
However, I must add that the present impure mind cannot arrogate to itself  
that pure state of being and claim ?I experience Bliss or the Self, for it is  
untenable. Therefore, when one is out of that state after sadhana and becomes  
limited and assumes that position, it is time to ask, ?"o whom are these  
experiences?"   
We must never, never forget that, after all, the Ultimate Reality is our own  
true Real Nature, which, as Sri Bhagwan has taught, is always attained.  
Therefore, our Self, the selves of all, the Atma-swarupa of all, alone is  
directly experienced. When we keenly enquire and investigate, and reach the  
Heart, we experience ourselves only, soundlessly and thoughtlessly as 'I Am  
I', and this is exactly, in , my view, is described as 'It Itself experiences  
or knows only Itself'.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Sri Bhagwan: Why do you pointlessly find fault with me, saying that I no  
longer look at you?   
If you would fix your gaze upon me, you would know that, established in the  
Heart, my gaze is ever fixed upon you.   
Looking at you from within the Self, I never leave you. How can this fact be  
known to your externalized vision?   
Source: Padamalai   
Dear devotees, when Assurance is so great and truth of His Presence in the  
Heart so glaring, convincing and within the direct experience of all truly  
earnest and sincere seekers, what does it matter whether He is in the body or  
without it? Only thing--we need to, nay, our duty is to internalise our vision  
to know and expereince directly the truth of Sri Bhagwan's Holy Utterances.   
Pranam,

Quote from Sri Ravi,   
"The mind has to calm down and not slow down.....and when the mind calms down,  
the breath will be very light and one may not perceive whether one is exhaling  
or inhaling unless one pays attention to it.....and the breathing will be  
long, deep and even and rhythmic......the body also will be felt quite light  
and nimble.....importantly the mind will not be empty but steeped in calm and  
contentment.....will be serene like a flame in a windless place."   
Dear Sri Ravi,   
This is a beautiful insight and understanding about which there cannot be two  
opinions. Sri Bhagwan has taught that passions are attended with irregular  
breathing, whereas calm and happiness are attended with slow and regular  
breathing.   
It is true, and Sri Bhaggwan has enjoined as well, that if breath is forcibly  
repressed, thought also is repressed, and if thought is forcibly slowed down  
and pinned to a point, the vital activity of respiration is also slowed down,  
made even and confined to the lowest level compatible with life. Sri Bhagwan  
has taught that in both cases the distracting variety of thought is  
temporarily at an end. Breath-control obviously, therefore, is a violent  
method, in which such control is the brake to the mind-horse. Such breath-  
control and repression forcibly of thoughts and emotions undoubtedly though  
makes the mind quiescent, it may sometimes cause fear and may result in  
shortened breath.   
However Sri Bhagwan always emphasized that if the mind is transformed though  
Enquiry into the Self, mind can no longer give any trouble in any way. Though  
in the earlier stages if the mind is brought to bear on the search for the  
Self, the mind eludes and the sadhak is not aware of its mischievous way until  
after some time, and therefore, it reverts to the search at long intervals  
only. With practice it reverts to the search at shorter intervals until  
finally it does not wander at all.   
Dear Sri Ravi, you may be aware that Sri Bhagwan Himself has given a  
picturesque description of control of mind by the analogy of reining of the  
rogue cow and confining her to the stall. The mind is like a rogue cow who,  
having been accustomed to graze stealthily on others' estates, cannot be  
easily confined to her stall, however much her keeper tempts her with green,  
luscious grass and fine fodder. She refuses the first time, then takes a  
little bit, but her innate tendency to stray asserts itself, and slips away.  
Only on being repeatedly tempted by the owner, she accustoms herself to the  
stall, and finally even if let loose she would not stray away and wander.  
Similarly with the mind. If but once it finds and experiences inner happiness,  
it is tempted and persuaded thus to taste the same bliss of peace again and  
again, and then there will come a time when it will not wander outward to  
graze on externals. When one thus practices steadily, as taught, with love and  
faith in Him and His Atma-vichara, the mind is surely reined in persuasively,  
gently and calmly unlike in pranayama or breath-control.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Quite true Anilbhai.   
I do not make any distinction between different approaches....all such  
distinctions are made by the mind of the 'doer'.All approaches,irrespective of  
the way they begin, have to end up in the calming of the mind and in the calm  
mind,Truth manifests.   
As Sri Adi Sankara says wonderfully in his bhaja Govindam: satsangathvE nissangathvam   
NissangathvE nirmohathvam   
NirmohathvE Nischalatatvam   
Nischala tatvE jivanmukti.   
The aim and objective of all so called paths are to free the mind from its  
cravings. ..nirmohathvam........and this nirmohathvam leads to  
nischalatatvam.....a mind that is steadily steeped in pure awareness.

Sri Bhagwan: Yogas chitta vritti nirodhah--(Yoga is to check the mind from  
changing)--which is acceptable to all. That is also the goal of all. The  
method is chosen according to one's own fitness. The goal for all is the same.  
Yet different names are given to the goal only to suit the process preliminary  
to reaching the goal. BhaKti, Yoga, Jnana are all the same.  
Svasvarupanusandhanam bhaktirity abhidheeyate (Self-contemplation is called  
bhakti).   
Dear Sri Ravi,   
Therefore, yes, Sri Patanjali's first sutra is applicable to all approaches  
whatsoever. The aim of all spiritual practices is the cessation of mental  
activities and the attainment of calm and peaceful mind. All-important  
intuition arises only in calm, serene and peaceful mind (Pure Mind).  
Therefore, yes, approaches may differ, but they all have to ultimately end in  
Jnana-experience, that is, in the clear knowledge I AM THAT I AM, that is,  
in the Fullness of the Self-knowledge.   
Thanks very much, dear Sri Ravi.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Dear Devotees, of all the scientists, I never ceased to marvel and wonder at  
Sri Albert Einstein who fascinated and intrigued me greatly, not only because  
he gave Theory of Relativity (Special or General) or due to Mass-Energy  
Equivalence Theorem, but also on account of his spiritual utterances, such as  
one that follows: "The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the  
source of all true art and science. He to whom the emotion is a stranger, who  
can no longer pause to wonder and stand wrapped in awe, is as good as dead--  
his eyes are closed. The insight into the mystery of life, coupled though it  
be with fear, has also given rise to religion. To know that what is  
impenetrable to us really exists, manifesting itself as the highest wisdom and  
the most radiant beauty, which our dull faculties can comprehend only in their  
most primitive forms--this knowledge, this feeling is at the centre of true  
religiousness."

Leisure   
What is this life if, full of care,   
We have no time to stand and stare.   
No time to stand beneath the boughs   
And stare as long as sheep or cows.   
No time to see, when woods we pass,   
Where squirrels hide their nuts in grass.   
No time to see, in broad daylight,   
Streams full of stars, like skies at night.   
No time to turn at Beauty's glance,   
And watch her feet, how they can dance.   
No time to wait till her mouth can   
Enrich that smile her eyes began.   
A poor life this if, full of care,   
We have no time to stand and stare.   
Sri William Henry Davies   
Dear devotees, alas! A poor life this indeed if, full of care, we do not have  
time to stand and stare!

Dear devotees, what follows is a quote from the Article 'Recollections',  
written by Sri Bhagwan's childhood friend, Sri Ranga Iyer, published in the  
Mountain path: Bhagwan told me the following: "Once when I was at Skandasram and they were  
celebrating my Jayanthi, many people came up from the town. With them came a  
mongoose too. I imagined it was probably a pet reared by one of the visitors.  
But it came straight to me, got on my lap, stayed there for a time, then went  
and inspected the room where things had been collected for the Jayanthi  
celebrations and the kitchen and then went away up the hill. It was of a  
golden hue. I didn't know which great saint came like that. Saints can come in  
any form they like". I (Sri Iyer) thought within myself, "Crows, monkeys,  
squirrels, sheep, cattle, all dumb animals are somehow able to discern the  
greatness of Bhagwan and go to Him for darshan. Only men with their reasoning  
faculty are not able to recognize His true worth. "   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Dear Devotees,   
May be some members here do not find anything worth reading and contemplating  
in the Mountain Path. But for me, anything, even a piece of a straw, coming  
from Sri Ramanasramam is so holy and sacrosanct. One cannot imagine my joy and  
how happy I am when I receive the Magazine after every three months here in my  
home in Patna!   
As for contents in the Mountain path, I wish to say that every issue of the  
Mountain Path contains a few very beneficial articles for sadhakas authored by  
distinguished devotees of Sri Bhagwan, such as, Sri Sadhu Om, Sri Michael  
James, Sri John Grimes, Swami Sri Tanmayananda, etc. I never went through all  
the articles contained in Mountain path but read only those articles, which,  
in my view, were worth reading because contents were relevant to me.   
As far as filling in the pages is concerned, all spiritual magazines are like  
that, and I have yet to see a better one. This magazine has certainly a place  
in the scheme of things so far as Sri Bhagwan's devotees are concerned. Yes, I  
feel that editorials of the magazine now-a-days are not quite what they used  
to be when great devotees like Sri Arthur Osborne were at the helm of affairs.  
Therefore, I feel that it is wise to take what is there to be taken and leave  
the rest unattended, for from the popularity of the magazine I have gathered  
that Sri Bhagwan's devotees still love to go through a few articles that fill  
in the pages in the Mountain Path.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Dear Anil   
I very must resonate with your views with regard to Mountain Path. I also  
eagerly look forward to it when it comes from Sri Ramana Ashram and treat it  
as a prasad and have maintained almost all the bask issues. True, not all the  
articles in each issue have the same quality but I am happy even if I find one  
article interesting in an issue .

Friends,   
Quote

This is copied from the asramam website.With the wealth of material available  
in India alone-The Vedas,the upanishads,The Gita,The Bhagavatham,The  
Ramayana,Mahabharata,Mahabhaktavijayam,Periya puranam,The  
Tirumanthiram,..........the list is endless.Besides this are the writings and  
insightful talks of Great ones that are readily available.....There are also  
similiar material available from the works of saints and mystics from other  
parts of the world as well.....All this apart from the teachings and writings  
of Sri Bhagavan and many devotees.......Many of the articles can be read over  
and over again and previously published ones can be repeated ;there should be  
no need to solicit the following: Quote  
> Please address original and previously unpublished submissions or letters in  
> English to ?Attn: Editor, The Mountain Path?.  
There need be no difficulty to fill the magazine with inspirational  
material.Even if there are copyright issues involved,the same can be easily  
resolved by requesting organizations like the Ramakrishna Mutt,Divine Life  
Society,Chinmaya mission,etc...and such requests will never be refused.   
In this respect,I should say that the 'vision' magazine from papa Ramdas  
Anandashramam does a fine job.Almost all articles have a Practical spiritual  
bearing and avoids scholarly trappings.Why should there be an 'Editorial' in a  
spiritual magazine?This one does not carry one.Also,it is available as a free  
download.....including the latest issue....The paper magazine has a cost  
attached to it to take care of paper,printing and distribution.   
Copies can be read online here: http://www.anandashram.org/html/vision.html   
Anandashramam does not have much of a material resource but even limited as  
there resources are,the swamiji in charge runs it in a true spirit of  
dedication.   
P.S:I take a dispassionate, objective, non sentimental view on this.   
Namaskar

Dear Devotees,   
As I have gathered, questions regarding 'effort and destiny' and 'effort and  
Grace' were often raised even before Sri Bhagwan before His Mahasamadhi, as  
have often been raised in this forum by some members from time to time.   
As regards the limited attaining the Unlimited, I wish to say that all seekers  
and devotees, irrespective of the sadhana they are following, should always  
remember that the Realization is due to Master's Grace more than anything  
else. Grace is the primary and essential cause.   
Yes, the limited by itself can never attain the Unlimited. For instance,  
jiva's limited effort by itself can never attain the Infinite Being, the  
Unlimited. One may ask that if the Realization is dependent on Grace, what is  
the use of effort then?   
Well, the sun is there and shines and one is surrounded by sunlight. Still, if  
one would know the sun one must turn one's gaze in its direction and look at  
it. Similarly, Sri Bhagwan has taught, GRACE IS ONLY TO BE FOUND BY  
EFFORT, ALTHOUGH GRACE IS ALWAYS THERE ALL ALONG, HERE AND NOW.   
Dear devotees, Grace is the primary and essential cause, and effort is  
imperative, for Grace is vouchsafed to those who are true devotees or yogins,  
who have striven hard and ceaselessly on the path towards freedom.   
Therefore, it all finally comes to subsidence or merging of the mind into its  
Source, by whatever method. As I have understood and grasped Sri Bhagwan's  
Teaching, the moment it happens (subsidence or merging), the Grace rushes  
forth, spouting as from a spring within us.   
Dear devotees, when our limited effort and Infinite Guru's Grace act and react  
upon each other, we realize our Swarupa as the Infinite Being!   
Thanks very much,   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Quote  
> how do the karmas in themselves carry the seeds of their own destruction?  
Dear Sri Anil ji,   
I present below some abstract expressions as it came forth!   
Just as a cracker that is lit would get exploded,   
just as life would end in death,   
Just as a dream ends upon waking up,   
just as with the sun rise darkness ceases,   
with the dawn of knowledge karmas end!   
All that has a beginning, carries its own end for sure, this is inevitable!   
When True Jnana shines, that is when the Self chooses to come out of its  
cocoon of ignorance, karma ends then and there!   
How long can we carry this body that is so burden-some? How long can one keep  
walking, running? Another name for Jiva is Karma!   
How long can one bind himself in various karmas, good or bad!   
Just as the Sun's light cannot be curtailed, darkness's destruction cannot be  
curtailed for long!   
So long one wakes up from sleep, that long karmas have a rein!   
So long the Self chooses, that long Karmas have a rein!   
This very moment, it can end, if the Self chooses so!   
yamevaiṣa vṛṇute, tena labhyas tasyaiṣa ātmā vivṛṇute tanῡṁ svām.   
He whom the Self chooses, by him the Self is gained. (Kathopanishad)   
Self is free from Karma at all times, If the knowledge of Self is gained,  
there is no Karma for him! If there is no Kartrutva--Bhava, there is no Karma.  
If there is the Kartrutva-Bhava, there is Karma.   
How long can one carry the burden of doership? Not long enough!   
He who has known Self, is free from Karma!

Tamil poet Kannadasan sang,   
"satti suttadhadaa kai vittadhadaa"   
When the hands that carry the pots feels the heat of the pot, it drops it  
immediately!   
the Pig relishes eating the filth,   
without knowing about the filth,   
the moment it knows,   
it will cease from eating it!   
In a way, we are all running like this, but actually going no where!   
The moment, Vichara steps in, the running slow down, slows down and eventually  
stops altogether when it is known that we are going nowhere!   
Dear Sri Anil Ji, I have seen people becoming senile after retirement, since  
they are so used to working, engaging in activities, there are unable to  
remain quiet! How long the body can cater to the needs of the mind? The mind  
is restless! They end up becoming slaves of Karmas, some engage in good  
activities, yet remain restless!   
Therefore, one should retire before one's reirement, die before the body's  
death! Send our near and dear ones to heavens before Lord of Death takes them  
all by surprise and leave us in lurch!   
Death is one topic, evenpeople immersed in Spirituality do not bother looking  
it deeply enough! Spirituality seem to give us some temporary anesthesia from  
the death, that we are the Self it is deathless. But when real Death strikes,  
man is shaken and no spirituality or immortality helps!   
One has to contemplate deeply about Death and it results in "Mritunjayam"

Dear Devotees,   
We shall not hear any more from the great devotee that Sri Graham is. When I  
learnt that he has attained the Feet of his Guru, I experienced a deep, heart-  
felt loss.   
Expressing my condolence to the bereaved family members, I wish to say that I  
shall not write and post anything for a few days as a mark of love for and  
respect to the great devotee. However, I wish to say also that death has  
caused only dissolution of his mortal coil, for his attainment would continue  
to inspire and guide us as before.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

## Re:[4935] Self-enquiry as taught by Sri Bhagwan is enough

To a questioner Sri Bhagwan said: "How do you say 'I am'? Do you take a light  
to find yourself? Or did you come to know it on reading books? How?"   
The questioner said: 'By experience.'   
Sri Bhagwan : "Yes, Experience is the word. Knowledge implies subject and  
object. BUT EXPERIENCE IS NON-TERMINAL, ETERNAL".   
Talk--128   
Dear Devotees,   
What experience is non-terminal, eternal? When we perceive sense objects, can  
this perceiving be termed as 'experience' then? When we perceive sense  
objects, we essentially experience 'I' or 'I am', while almost simultaneously  
we have the perceptions of the objects. 'I' or 'I am', therefore, alone is the  
true non-terminal, experience. So, we many also say that Atma-swarupa or the  
Self is ever experienced and never non-experienced. I or 'I am' alone is the  
true experience or ANUBHAVA, while 'this' or 'idam' or 'so and so' are mere  
perceptions or PRATIBHASA or unreal appearance, like the water in the mirage.   
Dear devotees, we do not require mirror, or books, or others' recognition to  
be conscious of our own being or existence as 'I' or 'I am'. Do we? We do not  
require mind or the senses to affirm our existence as 'I' or 'I am'. So, we  
may also say that the experience of our being or existence is the only  
experience whatsoever that is attained without the mind and senses. Awareness  
of our being therefore is always assured, always self-evident, even during the  
state of deep sleep. Hence we may conclude that Experience is that in which  
'I' is aware of only 'I', that is, only as 'I am I', that is, the Self  
experiences or knows only and only the Self.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Dear devotees,I missed to say in my previous post that while practicing Sri  
Bhagwan's Vichara diligently and unswervingly, I have understood, with a great  
amount of certainty, that thought is superficial and analytical, feelings  
happen at a deeper level, while experience of our own being or existence as 'I  
AM I' is continuous, deepest, non-terminal and eternal. EXPERIENCE alone  
therefore is the truest, EXPERIENCE is the WORD, as Sri Bhagwan has taught.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Dear devotees, for a change, I would like to post some immortal lines from Sri  
Shakespeare's plays, as following: Macbeth speaks: Tomorrow, tomorrow, and   
tomorrow,   
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,   
To the last syllable of recorded time;   
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools   
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief   
Candle!   
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor   
Player,   
That struts and frets his hour upon the   
stage,   
And then is heard no more. It is a tale   
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,   
Signifying nothing.   
(Macbeth)   
"The days creep slowly along until the end of time. And every day that has  
already happened has taken fools that much closer to their deaths. Out, out,  
brief candle. Life is nothing more than an illusion. It's like poor actor who  
struts and worries for his hour on the stage and then is never heard from  
again. Life is story told by an idiot, full of noise and emotional disturbance  
but devoid of meaning."   
Dear devotees, Now I would like to post a few immortal lines from Sri  
Bhagwan's Holy Utterances: "The pictures move on the screen in a cinema show; but does the screen itself  
move? No. The Presence is the screen, you, I, and others are the pictures. The  
individuals may move but not the Self."   
Dear devotees, obviously the import of the words of Sri Shakespeare's  
protagonist in Macbeth and Sri Bhagwan's Holy Utterances are one and the same.  
However, if anyone has any doubt, one should also remember following immortal  
lines from 'As You like It': All the world's a stage   
And all the men and women merely players   
They have their exits and their entrances   
And one man in his time plays many parts.   
(As You Like It)   
Indeed, Sri Shakespeare was an enlightened poet and playwright, like many  
romantic poets of the English Literature.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Sri Bhagwan: "It is said that the sole purpose of all that is taught in  
scriptures is removal of dukkha nivritti (misery) and attainment of sukha  
prapti (happiness), but how to remove misery, which never exists, or to attain  
happiness, which alone ever exists?"   
Dear Devotees,   
Every one of us now knows that simple being is our blissful, natural state. Do  
we not? So, He taught, 'Just Be'. But so long as one remains absorbed in the  
world of objects with an out-going mind, one cannot remain for long as just  
simple being, as Awareness Itself, that is, as mere Witness or Seer. So, if  
many old, great devotees, such as Sri Annamalai Swami, advocated strongly to  
take up Sri Bhagwan's Enquiry from the very beginning, knowing fully well that  
Self-Enquiry ultimately is simply to just be and remain as the Self that one  
ever is, this is because its long practice convinced them with great certainty  
that preliminary Enquiry (To whom?, Who am I?, Whence am I?, etc.) is potent  
enough to destroy predispositions on account of which mind is externalized and  
thoughts arise. And it does not require a great philosophical mind to sense  
that the more the vasanas or predispositions get destroyed by preliminary  
enquiry, the more and more longer one would surely be able to just be, that  
is, to remain in the state of simple being, as the Self, or as the Awareness  
Itself, that is, in Natural State. This is how one graduates and gravitates to  
ultimate form of Vichara or the Enquiry from the preliminary one. This is how  
one reaches fast enough to the state of effortlessness. State of  
effortlessness is that is which almost all predispositions have been erased,  
mental agitation is off to a great extent, and one is now able to just be and  
remain as mere being for long periods. Sri Bhagwan has enlightened us that  
rest is the work of the Self or Grace Itself, for the Self is only waiting to  
destroy the residual ego-mind and overwhelm such a one with outpour of  
nectarine bliss of the Atma-swarupa.   
AND THIS HOW ONE REMOVES MISERY, WHICH NEVER EXISTS, AND ATTAINS  
HAPPINESS, WHICH ALONE EVER EXISTS.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,   
 Anil   
Note: dear devotees, I have been given now a special assignment by my  
department in this difficult time of devastating flood in Bihar, and  
therefore, for some time I shall be attending this forum only off and on. Anil

Dear devotees, what follows is an excerpt from 'Maha Bhakta Vijayam': Embracing the emperor (Akbar), Tulsidas said, "O great king, you are of  
sattvic nature, established in peace and harmony! That which is glorified in  
Quran is the same Truth which is expounded in the Vedas. The conflict arises  
because Hindus worship the forms along with the formless, whereas Muslims  
abhor idol-worship. Both religions point to the same Ideal. The form is like  
the salt and formless is like the sea water. Out of ignorance, people do not  
comprehend the whole truth. IF ONE MAKES DEEP ENQUIRY, ONE WILL REALIZE  
THAT ALL RELIGIONS UTTER THE SAME TRUTH. Therefore, realize the Brahman,  
the formless Absolute, which you have been cherishing, within your heart and  
immerse in bliss."   
Tulsidas, placing his hands on the head of the emperor, blessed him and  
initiated him into the mahavakya. He enlightened him about how jivas mistake  
the body mind complex for one's real Self and wallow in darkness. He explained  
about the gross, subtle and causal bodies and the individual sense or egoism  
which binds the jiva (individual soul)to the material world and enmeshes it in  
attachment and ignorance. He elucidated on the mysterious nature of jagrat,  
swapna and sushupti i.e. waking, dreaming and deep sleep states; and also on  
the unfathomable and inexpressible transcendental state of the Absolute and of  
the signs of great bliss when one dives deep within. Thus he dilated upon the  
esoteric truths of monism. Then he asked the emperor whether he had any  
doubts.   
Since the precepts he had heard from Muslim fakirs and the path set out by the  
saint were more or less the same, the emperor gained a clear understanding; so  
he kept quiet. After a while, he asked, "O revered Swami! Whatever you said  
agrees with what our priests tell us about the formless aspect of Godhead and  
of the DIRECT EXPERIENCE of the Self.   
Source: Mountain Path   
Dear devotees, and both the precepts as well as the path taught by Sri Bhagwan  
agree perfectly with what the great Saint Sri Tulsidas and great Fakirs of  
Muslim Faith taught the great emperor Akbar. Whatever one's religion, when  
one is able to internalize the mind and to dive deep within, and makes deep  
and profound enquiry, one realizes the truth of the Mahavakyas, such as, 'An-  
al-haq i.e. Verily, I am the Truth', or 'Aham Brahmasmi i.e. I am Brahman', or  
'I AM THAT I AM', and simultaneously realizes the great bliss of the Self  
or the Atma-swarupa, which is one and same for all, for, salt may be of  
different varieties, but sea water remains forever the same for everyone  
whosoever.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

The world is not other than the mind; and the mind is not other than the  
Heart. The story, therefore, completely ends in the Heart.   
V. 5-12, Sri Bhagwan (Sri Ramana) Gita   
The mortal is aware of the mind, only when the Heart has not blossomed, just  
as the moon is seen only when the Sun has not appeared.   
V. 5-15, Sri Bhagwan (Sri Ramana) Gita   
Without seeing the origin of light, the true form of one's Self the ordinary  
man sees by the mind different things and is deluded.   
V. 5-16, Sri Bhagwan (Sri Ramana) Gita   
The Jnanin present in the Heart sees the mind merged in the light of the  
Heart, like moonlight in the presence of the Sun during the day.   
V. 5-17, Sri Bhagwan (Sri Ramana) Gita   
Dear Devotees,   
That which rises and says 'i' (little self) is the mind, which Sri Bhagwan has  
revealed, is nothing but thoughts and concepts. These thoughts and concepts  
appear real because they shine in the Light of the Self, appearing to be  
continuous, weaving and scripting the story of the world, which, in fact, is  
the story of this little self, different for each one. So, seeming world for  
every one of us is not objective, but subjective, private one, consisting of  
one's own thoughts of likes and dislikes, concepts and hurts, etc. However,  
Sri Bhagwan has taught, as above, that mind is not different from the Heart,  
and mind is born only from the Heart. For this reason, in the Heart, in the  
sight of the true form of the Self alone, the entire story finishes, the story  
of the little self, story of the world, et al. FOR IN BLISSFUL AWARENESS,  
MENTAL LIVING IS BUT THE PALEST SHADOW. So long as one is living in the  
mind, it is, in my view, simply not possible to stop telling the story of the  
self and see who one is without it. By conscious effort, with dispassion and  
discrimination, one must penetrate to one's deepest Core, that is, to the  
Heart, which is the locus of the Self, and see the Original Light. Without  
seeing the Original Light and experiencing oneness within, we see, by the  
reflected light called mind, myriad divisions outside, that is, many objects  
in the external world, creating and scripting stories ad nauseam. Therefore,  
our duty is to first endeavour to see the Light of the Self, for only in that  
Light the entire story finishes, all statements conclude.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Idol Worship   
Softly, your head resting on your left palm,   
You look at me from the corners of your eyes.   
I feel a sensation creep from toe to top.   
You smile, white teeth vying with white beard,   
Face lit up with the glance and the smile.   
Are you angry with me for dwelling thus on your outer form?   
What else can I do but stare at that   
As if it were you?   
Do I not think my body is 'I'?   
How can I see the light behind   
The brightness of your face?   
How can I see the God in the idol.   
While I am an idol, nothing else?   
An idol can only worship an idol.   
But the god in that idol stirs to life   
The god in this.   
That sat swallows this aham   
So in Soham, I in That   
Disappear and cease to be.   
And yet I am, I am, for I   
Am now You and You are That.   
By Sri C.L. Narasimha Rao   
Dear devotees, yes, undoubtedly, LOVING AND WORSHIPING STIR THAT IDOL TO  
LIFE. That is the Experience of all His devotees. Is it not?

CONTROL OF MIND: (Mind alone is the cause of man's bondage and freedom)   
 Amritabindu Upanishad   
D: I have not yet learnt to control my mind so I intend to seek ekantavasam  
(life in solitude) in North India and want Sri Bhagavan's grace.   
Sri Bhagwan: You have come all the way to Tiruvannamalai for ekantavasam, and  
that in the immediate presence and vicinity of Ramana Bhagavan, yet you do not  
appear to have obtained that mental quiet; you now want to go elsewhere and  
from there you will desire to go to some other place. At this rate there will  
be no end to your travels. You do not realize that it is your mind that drives  
you in this manner. Control that first and you will be happy wherever you are.  
I do not know if you have read Swami Vivekananda's lectures. It is my  
impression that he has somewhere told the story of a man trying to bury his  
shadow and finding that over every sod of earth he put in the grave he had dug  
for it, it only appeared again, so that it could never be buried. Such is the  
case of a person who tries to bury his thoughts. One must therefore attempt to  
get at the very bottom from which thought springs and root out thought, mind  
and desire.   
D: When I spent an hour or two on the hill yonder, I sometimes found even  
better peace than here, which suggests that a solitary place is after all more  
conducive to mind-control.   
Sri Bhagwan: True, but if you had stayed there for an hour longer, you would  
have found that place too not giving you the calm of which you speak. Control  
the mind and even Hell will be Heaven to you. All other talk of solitude,  
living in a forest etc., is mere prattle.   
D: If solitude and abandonment of home were not required, where then was the  
necessity for Sri Bhagavan to come here in his seventeenth year?   
Sri Bhagwan: If the same force that took this (meaning himself)here, should  
take you also out of your home by all means let it, but there is no use of  
your deserting your home by an effort of your own. Your duty lies in practice,  
continuous practice of Self-enquiry.   
D: Is it not necessary to seek the company of the wise (the Saints and Sages)?   
Sri Bhagwan: Yes; but the best sat-sangam is inhering in your "Self". It is  
also the real guhavasam (living in the cave). Dwelling in the cave is retiring  
into your "Self". Association with the wise will certainly help a great deal.   
Source: Crumbs from His Table   
Dear devotees, as I said on several occasions before, I have continued to  
share my insight and understanding on Sri Bhagwan's Teaching with you, only to  
keep myself established at His Feet, and not for your appreciation and any  
kind of praise at all. And what is His Feet? His Holy Feet is 'I-I' to which  
the head, that is, the little self 'i' keeps worshiping, prostrating and  
surrendering. Besides, if I still needed some Shravana (Hearing) and Manana  
(Contemplation), I wish to say, as Sri Sadhu Om said, there is no better  
Shravana and Manana for me as well for His devotees other than DWELLING on His  
Teaching. Having come to Sri Ramana Bhagwan, and having experienced great  
mental calm, I never, never felt any urge from within to go anywhere else, or  
for that matter, to anyone else. I have understood, from the very beginning,  
that my only and only duty is the continuous practice of the Self-enquiry,  
leaving everything else for Him to manage, thus willing to go where He will  
take. Not that I do not perform my worldly duties with the same zeal anymore,  
but on the contrary, I have been able to perform them with best of my ability,  
that is, as far as I can, without my personal likes and dislikes interfering  
in the discharge of the duties. So, when I remembered the above quoted  
Teaching contained in the 'Crumbs from His Table', it occurred to me that it  
would be good to share my deepest feelings with you.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

**As the Self abides in being as existence, to be settled in that is the  
supreme Dharma of man or law of his being.   
As the meaning of the Self is 'I' whose character is Consciousness, to know  
that is the supreme Artha, the meaning of man, the purpose of his life.   
As the Self being blissful, is the dearest (to every one)the love of it is the  
supreme Kama, the desire of man.   
Source: Introduction to the Ramana Gita-Prakasha   
Dear Devotees,   
The author of the Ramana Gita-Prakasha has wonderfully thus concluded that  
Dharma, Artha and Kama, though appearing as three distinct objects of life,  
have only one Object, one Import, and that is the Realization of Brahman, the  
very Self shining in the Heart, as the 'I' eternal, pure, conscious and free  
in His Nature, and that is Moksha or Liberation, Vedanta and Sri Bhagwan speak  
of. He is to be sought for, He is to be known by subtle, profound enquiry.  
This is the heart of Bhagwan Sri Ramana's Teaching.   
Thanks very much.

A crippled disabled Brahmin came and complained: "O Bhagavan, right from my  
birth I have been suffering. Is it due to my past actions?"   
Sri Bhagavan said: We have to say that it is due to past actions. Then, if one  
asks what is the cause of those past actions, we have to bring in previous  
past actions and so on without end. Instead of enquiring into karma or  
actions, why not enquire whose karma it is? If we are the body, then let the  
body ask the questions. When you say, you suffer, it is your thought.  
Happiness is our natural state. That which comes and goes is the ego. We think  
we are miserable, because we forget our essential nature, which is Bliss. Even  
an emperor, in spite of his wealth and power, often suffers because of his  
disturbed mind. The sage, who does not know where his next meal will come

## Re:[4957] Self-enquiry as taught by Sri Bhagwan is enough  
Author: eranilkumarsinha    Date: September 10, 2017, 11:58:40 AM

Dear devotees, what follows is an excerpt from an Article named 'BOUNDLESS  
LOVE' by a devotee named Sri Gladys De Meuter: Whether Sri Bhagavan gently guided a devotee on the path of surrender, or  
another to follow the steep vichara method, or yet another to practise his or  
her own form of worship, whether it be along the lines of Hinduism or another  
religion, the sage always taught according to the receptivity of the enquirer.  
Unfailingly, his love forged a spiritual link which would never be severed. A  
striking example of this is the scene when a devotee asked heart-rendingly,  
'What if 1 go to hell?' The sage assured him that even there he would not let  
go of him.   
Whether Sri Bhagavan walks the earth in physical frame, or whether he has shed  
it, does not matter, since his love is ever present. ever powerful,  
everactive. Whatever path one follows, surely the greatest comfort is to know  
that the guru within is truly there, as Sri Bhagavan has taught.   
To quote but one example: It is night. A passenger peers out of an aircraft window. Suddenly, from the  
desert below, a glow of light is perceived. From the tempest-torn heart of  
this passenger a prayer pours forth, "God, be my light in the night of life's  
day". This person had never beheld the physical form of Sri Ramana Maharshi,  
yet the presence is here-now-always. How did this spontaneous prayer come  
about? It sufficed that one day a hand was guided to a book which bore a  
countenance, one with star-like eyes, a visage which radiated a glory which  
beggars description. Thus was the love song heard!   
The Sage of Arunachala does not belong to any specific time or place. He is  
beyond both.   
As homage to that wondrous love song, which, once heard, is never forgotten or  
silenced, a modest spiritual bouquet is tendered to the Beloved: Thou who alone knowest how to love-   
Blessed am I to know that Thou lovest me.   
Thou wilt never forsake me.   
No matter what manner of misfortune befalls me,   
When I am shunned, derided, cast aside by others,   
Thou art ever there, folding me in tender protectiveness.   
When aloneness, fears, doubts, temptations and other foes assail me,   
Thou art there to disperse them and put them to flight.   
Thou art my true eternal Love!   
In Thee alone do I find repose   
How to thank Thee, O boundless Love?   
By offering Thee my poverty-stricken heart!   
Source: Sri Ramana Smrti   
Dear devotees, blessed indeed is one who knows that He loves him, and  
therefore, will never be forsaken! And how to thank and what to offer such  
Boundless Love? He Himself has taught that hunting and offering the ego-self  
to the I-God within is the best offering, for He abides within as the  
Innermost Self, or as the Cause of one's being, in the hearts of His devotees!   
Pranam,   
 Anil

## Re:[4958] Self-enquiry as taught by Sri Bhagwan is enough  
Author: eranilkumarsinha    Date: September 11, 2017, 10:27:50 AM

Dear Devotees,   
Try as one would, a seeker is not able to recognise, contact and enter the  
state of Pure Awareness 'I Am', because while holding the 'I'-ness, he forgets  
to seek the source from which this 'I'-ness is emanating. Remember, seeking  
the Source is the dynamic element of the Enquiry, for, if one does that, one  
automatically reaches the Pure Witness, or the Seer or the Pure Illumination  
through which all seeing whatsoever is happening. Therefore, if one practices  
Self-enquiry, as often as possible, throughout the day, with the attitude of  
aloofness, solitude and detachment, attends to the 'I'-consciousness within,  
and seeks actively the Source, one is unfailingly led to the awareness of the  
True 'I', or 'I Am', or the Pure Perceiver, or the Seer, or the Witness. One  
needs to hold it, keeping very quiet and observing: This 'I' does neither  
think nor will nor desire; it has no qualities, is neither man nor woman, has  
neither body nor mind; it has no trace of the 'person' which you had in mind  
during your previous questions about the 'I', that is 'Who am I?'. It simply  
is conscious of itself as 'I am'. Not 'I am this', 'I am that'; only 'I am'.  
Another clue: It is not you, the individual who has this Pure  
'I'-Consciousness as an object, but this Consciousness is your real 'I'!   
This attitude of aloofness and detachment has to be kept and practised as  
often as possible throughout the day. Because the moment one perceives  
something and reacts on it, becomes interested or gets emotionally involved,  
positively or negatively, one has covered up the silent, neutral, pure,  
witnessing 'I' by the reactive, aggressive, personal 'I', exactly as clouds  
suddenly arrive from nowhere and cover the Sun.   
Therefore, dear devotees, sadhana of Sri Bhagwan's Vichara, in my view, also  
includes, nay, one is led to, the practice of attention to our own PERCEIVING,  
with the purpose of cutting it short just before the stage of reacting sets  
in. I am certain that if the Enquiry is practiced thus, with this kind of  
detachment and dispassion, the seeker will soon get to a state of pure  
awareness 'I AM'.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Sri Kunju Swami has narrated the following: Sri Bhagavan used to go into the kitchen by 4 a.m. and start cutting  
vegetables; one or two of us would also join and help. Sometimes, the amount  
of vegetables used to startle us. Bhagavan managed to cut much more and more  
quickly than the rest of us. At such times we would look up at the clock in  
our impatience to finish the job and try and have another nap. Bhagavan would  
sense our impatience and say: "Why do you look at the clock?" We tried to  
bluff Bhagavan saying: "If only we could complete the work before 5, we could  
meditate for an hour." Bhagavan would mildly retort: "The allotted work has to  
be completed in time. Other thoughts are obstacles, not the amount of work.  
Doing the allotted work in time is itself meditation. Go ahead and do the job  
with full attention." Sri Bhagavan thus taught us the importance of right,  
honest work.   
Dear devotees, if one performs the work allotted to him, with full attention,  
without entertaining other thoughts, in time, and without an eye on the fruits  
of the labour, doing work itself becomes meditation. Mind's ability to  
concentrate is strengthened. Such a mind, obviously, would be able to  
penetrate to one's deepest Core within, to the real 'I', with laser-like  
precision, when it comes to the Self-enquiry. Therefore, doing work allotted  
to a sadhak of the Atma-vichara, with right attitude, honestly and with full  
attention, is indeed a great help in the sadhana of the Direct Path   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Him the Lord some call the Primal Being,   
Others see Him as Being Supreme,   
Yet others proclaim Him the Being   
Centred in the orb of worlds and spheres.   
Sri Ganapati Muni   
 "The Lord, O Arjuna, dwells in the Heart of every being, and He by His  
delusive power spins round all beings set as if on a machine".   
Gita   
From Maharshi's Gospel: Sri Bhagwan: The functions of the body involving the need for an operator, are  
borne in mind; since the body is jada or insentient, a sentient operator is  
necessary. Because people think that they are jivas, Krishna said that God  
resides in the heart as the operator of the jivas. In fact, there are no jivas  
and no operator, as it were, outside them; the Self comprises all. It is the  
screen, the pictures, the seer, the actors, the operator, the light, the  
theatre and all else. Your confounding the Self with the body and imagining  
yourself the actor, is like the seer representing himself as an actor in the  
cinema-show. Imagine the actor asking if he can enact a scene without the  
screen ! Such is the case of the man who thinks of his actions apart from the  
Self.   
D: On the other hand, it is like asking the spectator to act in the cinema-  
picture. So, we must learn sleep-waking!   
Dear devotees, imagine asking a spectator to act in a cinema-picture, as it  
were, that is, as if it were so! Such is the case for our mistaken feeling 'I  
work'! Sri M. Frydman was a great devotee who elicited great responses from  
Sri Bhagwan, as contained in the Maharshi's Gospel.

**Him the Lord some call the Primal Being,

Yet others proclaim Him the Being   
Centred in the orb of worlds and spheres.   
Sri Ganapati Muni   
Dear devotees, someone may say that the Teaching contained in re-4960  
contradicts the Teaching contained in Re-4959. However, I wish to reiterate  
that, as I have understood, both Teachings can be reconciled rather  
wonderfully. What difficulty one encounters initially in the practice of the  
Self-enquiry, that is, one finds initially unable to turn one's attention in  
the diametrically opposite direction on to oneself within from the world and  
its objects outside, the same difficulty is encountered when one tires to  
perform a work with full attention, for other thoughts will assail and divert  
the attention. So, when one is finally able to do work, with practice, with  
full attention, work and the worker both merge together, and what remains is  
the Self. AND, SRI BHAGWAN HAS TAUGHT THAT WORK IS NOT APART FROM  
THE SELF. All ingredients required to perform the work, in time, accurately  
with perfection, will come about automatically. Hence, in that state, the work  
will be accomplished perfectly. Sri Bhagwan Himself is the Testimony, if proof  
is required at all!   
Pranam,   
 Anil

The Lord (Sri Krishna) answers: Notwithstanding the fact that the phenomena do not at all exist, yet so long  
as the contact between the unillumined jiva and the senses continues,  
transmigration does not cease. So long as the dreamer continues to be deluded  
by the dream objects, he continues to suffer dream sorrow, although this does  
not exist (but as sensations in him), and ceases when he becomes enlightened  
on waking. Grief, fear, birth and death affect the deluded part of the  
dreamer, the ego, and not his being or Self. True knowledge consists in  
distinguishing the Self, which is real, from the not-Self, which is unreal. By  
the means spoken of before and by the Grace of a perfect Master, this  
distinction is clearly perceived, and the body is completely rejected as the  
non-Self. Just as space is not affected by the elements : fire, water, earth,  
etc., of which it is the container, so is the imperishable, all-containing  
Being not affected by the gunas. Efforts must be made to shun the not-Self  
until supreme bhakti cuts down rajas, the active qualities which are  
responsible for the illusion....................................The  
unregenerate perform action till the last moment of their life, and are paid  
back in transient pleasure and pain, but the regenerate, though seated in a  
body remain actionless, their thirst for enjoyment having been slaked by the  
bliss of Self-realisation. Being permanently established in the Self, they  
take no heed of the actions of the body, nor do they take for real the objects  
that fall within the ranges of their perception, no more than an awakened man  
concedes reality to the objects he has perceived in a dream. The body which  
has so far been identified with one's own Self, dear Uddhava, and which is  
actually the product of the gunas and karma, now completely disappears in the  
light of Self-knowledge : not so the Self which can be neither perceived nor  
rejected (for the repudiator would still be the sentient Self itself, which  
remains as the absolute residuum). Just as the light of the sun dispels the  
darkness from the eye and reveals what has already been present but unseen, so  
does the realisation of Me dispel the darkness of the mind and reveal the  
Self, which has all along been invisibly present as the source of all  
experiences, the senses and speech, and which is self-luminous, beyond the  
reach of reason, words, births, time and space. The notion of differences in  
the absolute Self is entirely a delusion, for none exists other than itself.  
The claim of an irrefutable duality made by some arrogant dualists is utterly  
senseless.   
There are those who practise sense-control and manage to keep the body strong  
and youthful and take to the practice of yoga with the view of acquiring  
siddhis. The wise look askance at them and at their futile endeavour to  
preserve a body which is as perishable as a fruit on a tree.   
Srimad Bhagavata   
Dear devotees, the Lord says that the True Knowledge consists in  
distinguishing the Self, which is real, from the not-Self, which is unreal.  
Therefore, it follows that by adopting the means most suited to one's  
disposition and temperament, and most important, by the Grace of a perfect  
Master, this distinction must be clearly perceived and experienced, to be able  
to completely reject the body as the non-Self, and to see and be the Self that  
one ever is, without the little self and its myriads stories. Only  
intellectual understanding is not enough. The Knowledge must be the Experience  
in which there is no experiencer.   
Pranam,

Sri Bhagwan: Are you not distinct from thoughts? Do you not exist without  
them? But can the thoughts exist without you?   
Dear Devotees,   
The thoughts arise from the root 'I'-thought which in its turn arises from the  
Self. Therefore, Sri Bhagwan says, the Self manifests as 'I'-thought and other  
thoughts. He has taught that even good thoughts, though helpful in keeping  
off the bad thoughts, must themselves disappear before the state of  
Realization. Why? Because, in truth, we are the Self Himself, and thoughts are  
alien to the Self. Because I am the Self, the Self is most intimate. Nay,  
there can be nothing, nothing whatsoever, in the system of forms-gross or  
subtle, more intimate. So, the Self is more intimate than even the 'I'-thought  
or the ego. This is why Sri Bhagwan has taught that the thoughts must  
disappear in the Self, not even a trace of the 'I'-thought should remain, for  
Realization to dawn or happen. Following conversation may prove instructive: D: Is it right to think that all that happens to us are God's ordainment, and  
therefore, only good?   
Sri Bhagwan: Of course it is. Yet all others and God are not apart from the  
Self. HOW CAN THOUGHTS OF THEM ARISE WHEN YOU REMAIN AS THE SELF?   
Dear devotees, so, these thoughts have fields of play because, though ever the  
Self, we identify with the modes (vrittis) of the mind. But that which  
identifies with the mental modifications is not the real 'I' or the Self, but  
His reflection. Problem is that with a limited 'I', always rising identifying  
with a form, we are so stuck up, from birth after birth, that we are reduced  
to mere vrittis or modes rather than the Self that we are. We are so stuck up  
with this limited 'I' that we cannot see Our Own Light. The ant or the  
mosquito stings the body, but we are not the body. Yet one says that the body  
feels the bite and the pain, which appear so real. However, Sri Bhagwan  
remains unrelenting: "If the body feels it, let it ask. Let the body take care  
of itself. How does it matter to you?"   
Body is a mental projection, and pain, bite, joys, sorrows, et al, therefore,  
pertain to the body-mind adjunct, all not-Self, and alien to the Self. Error  
lies in the identification of the Self with the body. Hence, one must  
EXPERIENCE that all is the Self, there is no not-Self, nor body, nothing  
whatever, and indeed one is the Self. EXPERIENCE WITHOUT EXPERIENCER IS THE  
WORD. Only intellectual understanding is not enough, for such understanding  
is bound to be overtaken by sheer ignorance, sooner rather than later.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,

Dear Sri Anand, I do not think that 'forgone conclusion' is an appropriate  
phrase to be used in the realm of spirituality, for, like in everything worth  
attainment, there are obstacles to be overcome in the way. Besides, Guru's  
Grace is primary and the essential cause. What is meant is that if one  
practices Sri Bhagwan's Atma-vichara, with love for Him in the heart, with  
Faith in His Teaching, and with perseverance, Self-enquiry being its own  
guide, will certainly cut the root of ignorance in the form of ego or the  
'I'-conceit. Since this self-limitation is only a notion, or an imagination,  
Self-enquiry is potent enough to destroy this notion for once and all. A mere  
notion cannot limit the infinite Swarupa or the Self for long, for, when this  
false notion is scrutinized in the intense searchlight of the Self-enquiry, it  
is found to be non-existent, and what remains is the Fullness of  
Consciousness, or the Self-Consciousness, and that is the attainment of the  
ever attained Natural State, Sri Bhagwan speaks of.   
Pranam,

Sri Bhagwan: The thought-free state is one's primal state and full of bliss.  
Is it not miserable to leave such a state for the thought-ridden and unhappy  
one?   
Dear Devotees,   
Yes, thought-ridden waking state is too miserable and unhappy one indeed. A  
man fast asleep is free of thoughts and therefore enjoys the bliss of the  
sleep, such that he hates to be awakened from sleep, and those who try to  
disturb are asked to mind their own business. Are they not? T **he bliss of  
the thought-free state is too good to be disturbed. This is why the bliss of  
the sleep is too enthralling to be sacrificed to the actions born of thoughts.   
However, it is also true that whenever a person sits to either meditate or  
practice Enquiry, thoughts rush up in hordes, and it appears like an avalanche  
of thoughts. The attempt to penetrate through the barrage of thoughts appears  
very difficult, if not impossible, in the beginning. **This is why Sri Bhagwan  
has taught that if one wants to abide in thought-free state, a struggle is  
inevitable. One must fight one 's way through the thoughts to regain one's  
original primal state.   
Yet, rise of thoughts are taken advantage of by the practiser of the Self-  
enquiry to become aware of the real Self. How? Sri Bhagwan has enlightened  
that without the Sakti vyapara or the Movement of the Power, the Real is not  
apprehended. **Therefore, while attempting to maintain Self-attention, and  
searching what the ego-mind is and searching dynamically its Source, thoughts  
arise and recoil, and if the seeker is attentive and alert, he will gradually  
know that they arise from the Self. And this is the beginning of His  
apprehension. And Sri Bhagwan has assured that apprehending the Self even  
vaguely helps the extinction of the ego. **So, with practice if one realizes  
that the thoughts arise from the Self, and thus practices to abide in the  
Source, the thoughts will subside in the Self and the mind itself will  
disappear entirely.   
Sri Bhagwan: The thoughts are the enemy. They amount to the creation of the  
Universe. In their absence there is neither the world nor God the Creator. The  
Bliss of the Self is the single Being only.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,

Dear devotees, what follows is an excerpt from the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna: Sri Ramakrishna Param Hamsa: "The jnanis, who adhere to the non-dualistic philosophy of Vedanta, say that  
the acts of creation, preservation, and destruction, the universe itself and  
all its living beings, are the manifestation of Sakti, the Divine Power. If  
you reason it out, you will realize that all these are as illusory as a dream.  
Brahman alone is the Reality, and all else is unreal. Even this very Sakti is  
unsubstantial, like a dream."   
"But though you reason all your life, unless you are established in samadhi,  
you cannot go beyond the jurisdiction of Sakti. Even when you say, 'I am  
meditating', or 'I am contemplating', still you are moving in the realm of  
Sakti, within Its power."   
"Thus Brahman and Sakti are identical. If you accept the one, you must accept  
the other. It is like fire and its power to burn. If you see the fire, you  
must recognize its power to burn also. You cannot think of fire without its  
power to burn, nor can you think of the power to burn without fire. You cannot  
conceive of the sun's rays without the sun, nor can you conceive of the sun  
without its rays."   
"Thus one cannot think of Brahman without Sakti, or of Sakti without Brahman.  
One cannot think of the Absolute without the Relative, or of the Relative  
without the Absolute."   
"The Primordial Power is ever at play. She is creating, preserving, and  
destroying in play, as it were. This power is called Kali. Kali is verily  
Brahman, and Brahman is verily Kali. It is one and the same Reality. When we  
think of It as inactive, that is to say, not engaged in the acts of creation,  
preservation, and destruction, then we call, It Brahman. But when It engages  
in these activities, we call It Kali or Sakti. The Reality is one and the  
same; difference is in name and form."   
Dear devotees, Sri Param Hamsa says that some address the Reality as 'Allah',  
some as 'God', some as 'Brahman', some as 'Kali', and others by such names as  
'Rama', 'Jesus', 'Durga', 'Hari'. How often we have seen Sri Bhagwan's  
Utterances, regarding His Teaching on Siva and Sakti, or the Powerful and the  
Power, echoed the same as above, in meaning and import! That is why one  
addresses the Guru, who is none other than the Self or Brahman, as Father,  
Mother, and everything, that is to say, All, at once, in One.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Arunachala! The moment I thought of you, as 'Arunachala', I was caught up in  
the net of your Grace. Designed to ensnare devotees, can that net of Grace  
fail in its work, however slightly?   
V. 102, Sri Arunachala Aksharamanamalai   
Dear devotees, Sri Muruganar, while commenting upon the above Verse, has  
written that as Sri Manikkavachagar declares in Tiruvachakam, Hymn 3, 1. 42,  
"Behold He will be trapped in the net of devotion", Sri Arunachala's devotees  
are also planning to snare Him in the net of their devotion through love.  
However, before they can do so, He has already devised a stratagem to trap and  
hold them in the net of His Grace. It is through this means that they  
(devotees) gain the power to meditate upon Him. Sri Muruganar concludes this  
commentary with the following Verse from Tevaram: My Lord knew nothing about me.   
I too knew nothing about Him before.   
But the moment He knew me as His devotee,   
I too came to know Him as my Lord.   
5.91. V. 8   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Anilbhai/Friends,   
Nice to see you covering excerpts from The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna and  
drawing parallel with Bhagavan's self enquiry...and you have highlighted this  
particular excerpt in your post in this thread on 25th september :  **As is man 's meditation, so is his feeling of love;   
As is man's feeling of love, so is his gain,   
And faith is the root of all......**   
you have asked :"Dear devotees, will someone explain the meaning and import of  
the first line of the first stanza, as cited above 'As is man's meditation, so  
is his feeling of love'?"   
This is a very very important question that you have raised...especially in  
the context of vichara...and it will be helpful to refer the entire chapter 3  
of The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna to bring out the true import and essence of  
what the Master is conveying.   
In this chapter,the master goes to meet Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar,the noble  
philanthrophist and a vastly learned person!...Sri Ramakrishna used to seek  
out persons and go and visit them in their homes...Such an ocean of compassion  
was the master!.   
On meeting Vidyasagar,the master says _" Ah! Today, at last, I have come to  
the ocean. Up till now I have seen only canals, marshes, or a river at the  
most. But today I am face to face with the sagar, the ocean."_(All laugh.)  
('Vidyasagar' means 'ocean of knowledge).   
We may refer the entire chapter here: http://www.belurmath.org/gospel/chapter03.htm   
 _If we go through this chapter,we find that the master is relentlessly  
driving home the Essence...God cannot be attained through study or  
learning;only through faith and Love one may realize Him._   
The Master says:"There is nothing in mere scholarship. The object of study is  
to find means of knowing God and realizing Him. A holy man had a book. When  
asked what it contained, he opened it and showed that on all the pages were  
written the words 'Om Rama', and nothing else.   
"What is the significance of the Gita? It is what you find by repeating the  
word ten times. It is then reversed into 'tagi', which means a person who has  
renounced everything for God. And the lesson of. the Gita is: 'O man,  
renounce everything and seek God alone.' Whether a man is a monk or a  
householder, he has to shake off all attachment from his mind.   
"Chaitanyadeva set out on a pilgrimage to southern India. One day he saw a  
man reading the Gita. Another man, seated at a distance, was listening and  
weeping. His eyes were swimming in tears. Chaitanyadeva asked him, 'Do you  
understand all this?' The man said, 'No, revered sir, I don't understand a  
word of the text.' 'Then why are you crying?' asked Chaitanya. The devotee  
said: 'I see Arjuna's chariot before me. I see Lord Krishna and Arjuna seated  
in front of it, talking. I see this and I weep.'   
The context and import of the song that Anilbhai has posted may be covered in  
the following posts....   
continued....

Excerpt from Chapter 3 'Visit to Vidyasagar' in The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna: The Master continued: "Faith and devotion. One realizes God easily through  
devotion. He is grasped through ecstasy of love."   
With these words the Master sang again: How are you trying, O my mind, to know the nature of God?   
You are groping like a madman locked in a dark room.   
He is grasped through ecstatic love; how can you fathom Him without it?   
Only through affirmation, never negation, can you know Him;   
Neither through Veda nor through Tantra nor the six darsanas.   
It is in love's elixir only that He delights, O mind;   
He dwells in the body's inmost depths, in Everlasting Joy.   
And, for that love, the mighty yogis practise yoga from age to age;   
When love awakes, the Lord, like a magnet, draws to Him the soul.   
He it is, says Ramprasad, that I approach as Mother;   
But must I give away the secret, here in the marketplace?   
From the hints I have given, O mind, guess what that Being is!   
 _While singing, the Master went into sam ādhi. He was seated on the bench,  
facing west, the palms of his hands joined together, his body erect and  
motionless. Everyone watched him expectantly. Vidyasagar, too, was  
speechless and could not take his eyes from the Master. _   
The Master always lives what he speaks and in this way demonstrates what it is  
to get immersed in the subject matter... _" As is man's meditation, so is his  
feeling of love"_   
continued...

Excerpts from The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna continued...   
 **Brahman and Śakti are identical**   
After a time Sri Ramakrishna showed signs of regaining the normal state. He  
drew a deep breath and said with a smile: "The means of realizing God are  
ecstasy of love and devotion - that is, one must love God. He who is Brahman  
is addressed as the Mother.   
 _He it is, says Ramprasad, that I approach as Mother;   
But must I give away the secret, here in the market-place?   
From the hints I have given, O mind, guess what that Being is!_   
"Ramprasad asks the mind only to guess the nature of God. He wishes it to  
understand that what is called Brahman in the Vedas is addressed by Him as the  
Mother. He who is attributeless also has attributes. He who is Brahman is  
also Śakti. When thought of as inactive, He is called Brahman, and when  
thought of as the Creator, Preserver, and Destroyer, He is called the  
Primordial Energy, Kāli.   
"Brahman and Śakti are identical, like fire and its power to burn. When we  
talk of fire we automatically mean also its power to burn. Again, the fire's  
power to burn implies the fire itself. If you accept the one you must accept  
the other.   
_" Brahman alone is addressed as the Mother. This is because a mother is an  
object of great love. One is able to realize God just through love. Ecstasy  
of feeling, devotion, love, and faith - these are the means_. Listen to a  
song: As is a man's meditation, so is his feeling of love;   
As is a man's feeling of love, so is his gain;   
And faith is the root of all.   
If in the Nectar Lake of Mother Ka1i's feet   
My mind remains immersed,   
Of little use are worship, oblations, or sacrifice.   
 **Growth of divine love lessens worldly duties**   
" _What is needed is absorption in God - loving Him intensely. The 'Nectar  
Lake' is the Lake of Immortality. A man sinking in It does not die, but  
becomes immortal_. Some people believe that by thinking of God too much the  
mind becomes deranged; but that is not true. God is the Lake of Nectar, the  
Ocean of Immortality. He is called the 'Immortal' in the Vedas. Sinking in  
It, one does not die, but verily transcends death.   
Of little use are worship, oblations, or sacrifice.   
If a man comes to love God, he need not trouble himself much about these  
activities. One needs a fan only as long as there is no breeze. The fan may  
be laid aside if the southern breeze blows. Then what need is there of a fan?   
(To Vidyasagar) "The activities that you are engaged in are good. It is very  
good if you can perform them in a selfless spirit, renouncing egotism, giving  
up the idea that you are the doer. Through such action one develops love and  
devotion to God, and ultimately realizes Him.   
"The more you come to love God, the less you will be inclined to perform  
action. When the daughter-in-law is with child, her mother-in-law gives her  
less work to do. As time goes by she is given less and less work. When the  
time of delivery nears, she is not allowed to do any work at all, lest it  
should hurt the child or cause difficulty at the time of birth.   
"By these philanthropic activities you are really doing good to yourself. If  
you can do them disinterestedly, your mind will become pure and you will  
develop love of God. As soon as you have that love you will realize Him."   
The essence is in this saying of the Master:" _What is needed is absorption in  
God - loving Him intensely. The 'Nectar Lake' is the Lake of Immortality. A  
man sinking in It does not die, but becomes immortal"_   
Meditation is this absorption in God...and the deeper it is, so is the feeling  
of Love...Love itself is the means and the end...without Love,it is not  
possible to be absorbed in God.   
continued...

Anilbhai/Friends,   
There is this wonderful verse of the Great Yogi Tirumoolar (Tirumanthiram): அன்பும் சிவமும் இரண்டு என்பர் அறிவிலார்   
அன்பே சிவம் ஆவது யாரும் அறிகிலார்   
அன்பே சிவம் ஆவது யாரும் அறிந்தபின்   
அன்பே சிவமாய் அமர்ந்து இருந்தாரே   
Anbum Sivamum irandu enbar arivilaar   
Anbe Sivam aavadu yaarum arikilaar   
Anbe Sivam aavadu yaarum arindapin   
Anbe Sivam aai amarndu irundaare. [verse 270]   
Love and Sivam are two-say the Ignorant   
Love alone is Sivam-None knows   
After Knowing Love is Sivam   
Such a one abides in Love as Sivam.   
To 'know' Sivam is to meditate on Sivam and to love Sivam and to abide as  
Sivam...this is 'vichara'   
Namaskar

Dear Sri Ravi,   
Quote: "Meditation is this absorption in God...and the deeper it is, so is the  
feeling of Love...Love itself is the means and the end...without Love, it is  
not possible to be absorbed in God."   
I read and reread your posts several times this morning, and I am so  
overwhelmed with feeling that I do not find words spontaneously to seek to  
describe it. Thank you so much, bhai sahib. It seems to me that Vichara is  
opening slowly but surely the floodgate of love, without there being an object  
of love in form. I needed something to affirm the feeling and thus to  
completely identify with the feeling of love, trickling now but with an  
unmistakable hint of of an impending surge. So, hearing the voice of intuition  
from within, I at once turned to the Gospel, a veritable treasure of wisdom,  
once again, to sip and assimilate the nectarine Utterances of the great  
Master, Sri Ramakrishna on love, devotion and faith.   
When I had been going through the Chapter 3, I came across the lines   
"As is a man's meditation, so is his feeling of love;   
As is a man's feeling of love, so is his gain;   
And faith is the root of all."   
And I was wonderstruck. I palpably experienced an echo from within and hence  
raised the question for an explanation as to its meaning and import. And what  
a wonderful explanation you have posted! Yes, indeed! As the meditation rises  
higher or goes deeper, so also feeling of love deepens and one begins to have  
a foretaste of non-dual, pure love Sri Bhagwan Ramana speaks of. So, how apt!  
As is a seeker's meditation, so is his feeling of love, and so is his real  
gain.   
Quote: "Love and Sivam are two-say the Ignorant   
Love alone is Sivam-None knows   
After Knowing Love is Sivam   
Such a one abides in Love as Sivam."   
Quote from Sri Ravi: "To 'know' Sivam is to meditate on Sivam and to love Sivam and to abide as  
Sivam...this is 'vichara'".   
Dear Sri Ravi bhai saheb, I have always learnt an invaluable spiritual lesson  
or two from you. Yes, to abide as Sivam or the Self, one must love Him. To  
mediate on Sivam and to abide in Love as Sivam, jettisoning the ego, are  
indeed the real Vichara!   
Master: "The means of realizing God are ecstasy of love and devotion - that  
is, one must love God."   
Quote from Sri Ravi: "What is needed is absorption in God - loving Him  
intensely. The 'Nectar Lake' is the Lake of Immortality. A man sinking in It  
does not die, but becomes immortal"   
Dear Sri Ravi, yes, I understood and grasped long ago that a sadhna devoid of  
love, devotion and faith is no sadhana at all, and such a dry sadhana, whether  
it be Vichara or Yoga or Japa, etc., will hardly be of any avail to a seeker  
or a devotee.   
Thanks again, bhai saheb.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Dear Sri Ravi, as exemplified by Sri Bhagwan Himself, and affirmed by so many  
of His old and present devotees, I have also, without any doubt, understood  
from the very beginning that the Atma-vichara, as taught by Bhagwan Sri  
Ramana, is a grand fusion of Prema and Jnana or Love and Knowledge, and that  
Love is the Mother of Knowledge, for both, in essence, are one and the same.

Love doesn?t appear to be a word used so much by practitioners of Vichara.   
Although, we can say Vichara is Love, Self is Love.   
Without this understanding, Vichara is quite desolate.   
But what is it to say, Self is Love?   
I suspect we could translate, **" all is Self", "there is only Self."**   
Somehow, I find Vichara to be more and more Love.

Quote: "Love doesn't appear to be a word used so much by practitioners of Vichara."   
"Somehow, I find Vichara to be more and more Love."   
Dear Sri Nishta, Yes, practitioners of Vichara generally do not mention the  
word 'love' in their discourses. But that does not mean that they do not love  
their Self. Sri Bhagwan has taught, and they know that if they have to abide  
in the Self as the Self, they must love the Self. Without love, absorption is  
impossible, as taught the great Master Sri Ramakrishna.   
Yes, Self is Love. Therefore, Vichara is at once both Love and Knowledge,  
which, in fact, are one and the same. However, I cannot agree with you more,  
for if you find Vichara to be more and more Love, this, in my view, is  
progress.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Sage Sri Vasistha to Sri Rama: The notion of 'I' is utter ignorance; it blocks the path to nirvana or  
liberation. Yet the foolish man endeavours with the help of this darkness of  
ignorance to find the light of truth! The investigation of the ego sense  
reveals its limitation and conditioned nature, or its total absence. It is  
found only in the ignorant and not in the knower of truth. The knower of  
truth, on the other hand, exists in the embodied or disembodied state without  
the least anxiety or sorrow, having totally abandoned the notion of the ego.  
**There is no fear of destruction in the battle painted on a canvas: even so  
when the knower of truth is established in inner equanimity, activity does not  
affect him.** In the case of the liberated sage, even the manifestations of  
conditioned behaviour are apparent, not real. **As in the case of the mantle  
of a gas-lamp, which retains its form and shape though it has really been  
burnt to ashes, the liberated sage 's personality is no-personality, his mind  
is no-mind and his conditioning is truly unconditioned.** It is Brahman and  
naught else. He who rests in total peace within, though apparently engaged in  
diverse activities externally, is liberated.   
Dear devotees, when a person's sadhana, at long last, culminates in the  
surrender of his personality to That, that is to say, if the ego is  
jettisoned, what remains is the Self. **Such a liberated man 's personality  
therefore is no-personality, which in truth, is the Mighty Impersonality.  
Likewise, such a one's mind is said to be no-mind which is, in fact, the Pure  
mind. Pure Mind is verily Absolute Consciousness. Remember, Pure mind is akin  
to empty sky or space. Thoughts in the Pure Mind therefore correspond to  
objects in the pure sky or space. This is why the Mind of a Sage (Pure Mind)  
is known verily as Brahman. This is what is meant by Biblical Precept or  
Mahavakya 'I AM THAT I AM.'

Dear devotees, what follows is an excerpt from the Gospel of Sri Ramakrihsna: Sri Hazra: The devotee really prays to his own Self.   
"The Master (Sri Ramakrishna): **What you say is a very lofty thought. The aim  
of spiritual discipline, of chanting God 's name and glories, is to realize  
just that. A man attains everything when he discovers his true Self in  
himself. The object of sadhana is to realize that. That also is the purpose of  
assuming a human body. One needs the clay mould as long as the gold image has  
not been cast; but when the image is made, the mould is thrown away. The body  
may be given up after the realization of God."**   
"God is not only inside us; He is both inside and outside. The Divine Mother  
showed me in the Kali temple that everything is Chinmaya, the Embodiment of  
Spirit; that is She who has become all this--the image, myself, the utensils  
of worship, the door-sil, the marble floor. Everything is indeed Chinmaya."   
"The aim of prayer, of spiritual discipline, of chanting the name and glories  
of God, is to realize just that. For that alone a devotee loves God."   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Chalti Chakki Dekh Kar, Diya Kabira Roye   
Do Paatan Ke Beech Mein,Sabit Bacha Na Koye   
Translation   
Watching the grinding stones, Kabir cries   
Inside the two stones, no one survives.   
Dear devotees, Sri Kabir sees the grinding stones pertaining to the duality  
(dwanda) that we live in. Heaven and earth, good and bad, male and female,  
high and low - all around is apparently duality only. This play of opposites,  
this Chalti Chakki (moving mill) gets everyone, no one is spared, no one is  
safe from it's powerful grip.   
Whoever remains in this duality is crushed. No one can survive. Sri Kabir  
cries because rarely, if ever, does one see the Oneness, the Divinity, behind  
this rampant duality.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Sri Bhagwan: **Who has the power to convey this in word when even Thou  
(appearing as Dakshinamurti) couldst do so in ancient days by silence only?  
Only to convey by silence Thy (transcendent) state Thou standest as a hill,  
shining from heaven to earth.   
Dear Devotees,   
Thus sang Sri Bhagwan in V. 2 of Eight Stanzas to Sri Arunachala. So, Sri  
Arunachala stands motionlessly to convey His State without speaking, that is,  
through Silence. And what does He convey through that Silence? It cannot be  
anything other than to just be, that is, to stand still without rising as a  
mere 'I'-thought or the wretched ego, and thus consciously stopping all mental  
activities.   
In the V.35 of Sri Arunachala Aksharamanamalai, Sri Bhagwan parys to Sri  
Arunachala, 'Tell me what is the means of salvation there is for me?' Sri  
Arunachala then did not teach Sri Bhagwan through WORDS or speech, but  
communicated through Divine Silence not to speak but instead to just stand  
still ( V. 36, Aksharamanamalai). **Other than this Mauna or Divine Silence  
there is no other means to truly know the Infinite Atma-swarupa. This is why  
Sri Dakshinamurti elucidated it without speaking. This is why Sri Arunachala,  
standing motionlessly as a Hill, is elucidating the 'Path of being',  
unspokenly spoken, through Mauna or Divine Silence.   
**Dear devotees, why is the Mauna or the Divine Silence is imperative to covey  
the truth of the Atma-swarupa? Because Sri Bhagwan has taught that 'I Am' is  
the Goal, if one holds it with effort, this sadhana, and when effortless, it  
is Realization. Therefore, Silence is absolutely essential because the nature  
of Goal, which is Absolute Silence of the Self untainted by rising of the ego,  
is not different from this 'Path of being'. So, it can be grasped rather  
easily: Since the Goal is Absolute Silence of the Self, untainted by rising of the  
spurious ego, It cannot be known other than by Mauna or Silence.   
Sri Muruganar: This is the reason why Arunachala, who is the very form of  
Dakshinamurti, Himself remained still, and spoke without speaking, 'Do not  
speak. Just be still.' The aim of the Guru in remaining still is to instruct  
His disciples to--cause them to--remain like Himself in their natural state.  
This illustrates the meaning of Mauna.   
Dear devotees, such is the greatness of Self-enquiry as taught by Sri Bhagwan  
that once one is drawn to Sri Bhagwan and His Atma-vichara, there is no escape  
from the Jaw of His Grace, until one is led from asking 'Who am I' or Whence  
Am I?' to the 'Path of being (to just be or stand still)', which culminates in  
the Realization of the Swarupa or the Self.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

The Master (Sri Ramakrishna) sang: Dive deep, O mind, dive deep in the ocean of God's beauty;   
If you descend to the uttermost depts.,   
There you find the gem of love.   
....................................   
........................................   
After the Master sang the above song, He said to Sri Bankim thus:  **" There are some who do not want to dive. They say, 'Won't we become  
deranged if we go to excess about God?' Referring to those who are intoxicated  
with divine love, they say, 'These people have lost their heads.' But they  
don't understand this simple thing: God is the Ocean of Amrita, Immortality."   
Source: The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna   
Dear devotees, what a pity that those who are totally oblivious of God's  
Presence or the Glory of the Atma-swarupa consider those who are intoxicated  
with divine love as deranged or mad men! And they do not dive deep because  
they are afraid that they would meet the same fate!! If only they could have a  
little faith in great ones' Utterances; and stand, stare and contemplate a  
little, they would reach the understanding that God alone Is, and He is the  
Ocean of Amrita, Immortality.   
**Therefore, once a devotee understands through the holy Words of a Master  
that in the innermost recess of hearts of all abides the Parmatamam (Self or  
God) who is the Ocean of Amrita or Immortality, his mind is gradually prepared  
to dive deep and descend to the uttermost depths. The great master says  
elsewhere that a man cannot get pearls by floating on the surface or swimming  
on the surface. Therefore, he must dive deep.   
Pranam,

Sri Dilip Kumar Roy: "But Maharshi," I asked after a hesitant pause, "why is it that the bhakta so  
often turns away from the jnani, even after they have both attained the goal?"  
He smiled, "But your premise is wrong, to start with", He said. **" For, as  
soon as the bhakta arrives he finds he is at one with the jnani. For then the  
bhakta becomes bhakti swarupa (the essence of bhakti) even as the jnani  
becomes jnana swarupa (the essence of jnana) and the two are one, identical,  
although pseudo-bhaktas and pseudo-jnanis may dub the idea 'crazy' and start  
pitching into one another". **Then He added after a pause, "But such strifes  
break out only among the followers of the illuminates. The Masters always stay  
above the battle". I was reminded of Sri Ramakrishna's joke about Rama and  
Shiva: "Even when they fight", He said, "the duel ends in perfect harmony,  
peace and love. But Rama's soldiers, the monkeys, and Shiva's henchmen, the  
ghouls, go ever on clashing and snarling and calling names".**   
Source: Sri Ramana Smrti   
Dear devotees, in ancient times as well as in modern times, when two fighting  
kings or two antagonistic governments arrived at an understanding and made  
truce, their armies ceased to fight against each other and 'cease fire' was  
called, but here even when the warring Gods' duel ends in perfect harmony,  
peace and love, their armies and followers go ever on clashing and snarling  
and calling names!

Dear Sri Beloved Abstract, see without the story and you will find that there  
is love only. Everything is dear because of love for the Self only, said Sri  
Bhagwan. All this therefore is for the Self, which is Love in which there is  
no lover and no beloved. Love alone drives us. Love for the Self and the path  
of being ensure that one is never swerved away from that Love which is  
manifested in the feeling of Oneness or Unity or Togetherness.

_**" Since the Scriptures proclaim, 'Thou art That which is called the  
Supreme', and since That itself always shines as Self, for one to meditate 'I  
am That and not this (the body and so on)', instead of knowing oneself through  
the enquiry 'What am I?' and abiding as Self, is indeed due to lack of  
strength (of mind) !"   
**_   
V. 32, Ulladhu Narpadu   
Dear Devotees,   
Therefore, the Scriptures point to the Reality, and establish the identity of  
the creatures as That. This is the great significance of the proclamation of  
the Sastras. Sri Bhagwan has unequivocally taught that the Reality has not  
been mentioned by the Scriptures to meditate Sivoham or Aham Brahmasmi, but to  
trace the significance and understand the import of the Sacred Texts. It is  
therefore certainly not enough to repeat the bare words or think of them.  
However, I feel that if one is not able to do 'Who am I?' Enquiry one may take  
up this practice as an aid as enjoined by Sri Annamalai Swami.   
**Dear devotees, the things most of us understand without much ado become  
difficult to be grasped by someone who remains always engaged merely in  
intellectual gymnastics and at best in enquiry into myriad school of thoughts.  
How can such a one understand that the the Sruti vakya, 'Aham Brahmasmi',  
relates to the State of Beatitude and not at all to the mode of mind. Sri  
Bhagwan says that one cannot become Brahman by continuing to repeat the  
mantra. It means that Brahman is not elsewhere. It is our own Self. So, if  
the Self is found, Brahman is found. It teaches not to attempt to reach  
Brahman as if it were in some far off place.   
Thanks very much.

Dear Sri Kishorelr   
Quote: "Can thinking be silent, such as a flower, completely open, letting the  
beneficial rays of the Sun envelop her and still, when some form of  
communication is needed, to respond in a natural way with a wholeness of  
being?"   
 **Yes, contrary to general perception and belief, thinking is not our nature.  
Now it is difficult to stop thinking and in the state of Realization it is  
difficult to think a thought.   
Since you are aware of the 'wholeness of being', I feel that you must also be  
aware of the ignorance in the form of egoism which prevents one from  
responding in a natural way with a wholeness of being as you said. Due to ego  
alone one is not able to remain in the Beatitude of the 'Fullness of Being',  
or in the Beatitude of Aham-Brahman. The old tendencies of the mind sprout up  
thick and strong and form an obstruction to that state of Beatitude. Ego is  
their root which flourishes in the externalized and differentiating  
consciousness caused by the forces of vikshepa and avarana (due to rajas and  
tamas respectively). Therefore, to ask 'Who Am I?', recognize the ever-present  
state of being and install the mind firmly in the Heart until these forces are  
utterly destroyed is the Way.   
Quote: "In fact, this is what life asks of us ceaselessly - to respond only when such  
a response is needed. The rest of the time, the being should be silent and  
watch in all serenity."   
 **Yes, being is Silence, Aham or 'I' is Silence. However, this understanding  
should be nurtured carefully and patiently and steadied with further practice  
till one remains as mere being to be able to respond when needed with the  
'Wholeness of Being'.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,

**Sri Bhagwan: Why should one be meditating 'I am Brahman?' Only the  
annihilation of 'I' is Liberation. But it can be gained only by keeping the  
'I-I' always in view. So the need for the investigation of the 'I' thought.   
Sri Bhagwan: Not to think 'I am Brahman' or 'All is Brahman' is itself  
jivanmukti.   
Dear devotees, if the 'I' is not let go, the 'I'-thought which appears only  
from time to time still disappears being unreal and illusory, and the  
intuitive 'I' (I-I), which always remains Self-shining even before It is  
manifest becomes manifest. Then only one understands that there are not two  
selves but one Supreme Self which pervades and permeates all.

Sri Bhagwan: The mind is simply fattened by new thoughts rising up. Therefore  
it is foolish to attempt to kill the mind by means of the mind. The only way  
of doing it is to find its source and hold on to it. The mind will then fade  
away of its own accord. Yoga teaches chitta vritti nirodha (control of the  
activities of the mind). But I say Atma vichara (Self-investigation). This is  
the practical way.   
Dear Devotees,   
 **I wish to remind the 'votaries of dropping off' that the ego or the mind  
(ego-mind) is not an entity or non-entity independent of the Self in order  
that it must be created or destroyed by itself. It always comes holding only  
'us' (the Self), and functions as an instrument of the Self and periodically  
ceases to function. That is to say, it appears and disappears. So, who will  
drop what? Can one get rid of one's shadow? Can ego get rid of itself? One's  
shadow can be apprehended by apprehending oneself. This is why Sri Bhagwan  
compassionately has taught with so much emphasis that the only and only way of  
doing it to find the Source and hold on to it till the very end.   
Therefore, Sri Bhagwan's Teaching of the Atma-vichara is absolutely  
unambiguous. The ego comes holding only us (the Self), and if we hold  
ourselves the ego will sure vanish and the Reality will shine forth as (I-I)  
of Its own accord. Besides, one must understand that ego will submit (drop off  
or surrender) only when it recognizes the Higher Power within. Then only all  
the illusory differences, which are like the blueness seen in the sky will  
disappear. Hence Sri Bhagwan's Message to the mankind is crystal-clear: Attend to the Centre of yourself with a keen mind to know 'Who Am I?', that  
is, seek always to stay at the Core Centre of the Enquiry 'Who Am I?', therein  
lies our salvation.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

**The Self is known to everyone but not clearly. You always exist. The Be-ing  
is the Self. 'I am' is the name of God. Of all the definitions of God, none is  
indeed so well put as the Biblical statement 'I AM THAT I AM' in EXODUS (Chap.  
3). There are other statements, such as Brahmaivaham, Aham Brahmasmi and  
Soham. But none is so direct as the name JEHOVAH = I AM. The Absolute Being is  
what is - It is the Self. It is God. Knowing the Self, God is known. In fact  
God is none other than the Self. (T-106)   
Dear devotees, **' I Am'ness is the clue and 'I Am' is the Realization. So,  
'I Am' is the Self. Sri Bhagwan has taught that pursuing the clue till  
Realization is Vichara. Vichara is therefore the process as well as the Goal.  
'I AM' is the goal and the final Reality. To hold to it with effort is  
vichara. When spontaneous and natural it is Realisation. These are Sri  
Bhagwan's Words of Grace and therefore there can be no doubt about their  
veracity. However, here comes someone who THINKS that if he pursues the clue  
('I Am'ness) his individuality will remain intact and such a one will not be  
able to get rid of the ego if he practices thus, and yet he claims that he  
practices Sri Bhagwan's Vichara! What can be said of that? It is simply  
ridiculous. Is it not?**

Dear Devotees,   
 Sri Sadhu Om has written that it is not necessary for sincere aspirants to  
name before-hand the feeling-'I' either as ego or as the Self. I am totally  
one with this insight, for Sri Bhagwan Ramana has Himself taught there are not  
two persons, ego and the Self, in the aspirant. Besides, everyone of us has  
the experience 'I am one and not two'. Have we not?   
Therefore, from the stage of practice itself, we should not give room to an  
imaginary dual feeling--one 'I' seeking for another 'I'\- by differentiating  
ego and Self as lower and higher self respectively.   
Are there two selves, one to be an object known by the other? For, the true  
experience of all is 'I am one'. For, the experience of Jnani is 'I am I'.   
In the lighter vein: however, Sri Beloved Abstract here alone seems to have  
many selves, each with a separate fantastic tale to tell, even if one is not  
willing to listen.   
Thanks very much.   
 Pranam,   
 Anil

Dear devotees, why does pratyaksha not mean seeing but being? Sri Bhagwan says  
that that though the seer cannot see himself, yet he does not deny his  
existence only because he cannot see himself with his own eyes as pratyaksha.  
Therefore, pratyaksha does not mean seeing, but Be-ing. 'To Be' is to realise.

Dear devotees, Sri Bhagwan has always reminded His devotees that they are the  
Self, that they are the Consciousness. Therefore, becoming conscious of being  
conscious is the key to enter the state of enquiry. Then meditate on 'I Am',  
that is, think only 'I Am' and see to it that nothing whatsoever is added to  
the thought of mere 'I Am'ness, by warding off the intruding thoughts. Now is  
the time to be aware of the 'stillness' that accompanies the 'I Am'. Sense  
your presence, the naked, unveiled, uncovered, unclothed beingness. Sri  
Bhagwan says that this pure beingness remains untouched whether we are young  
or old, good or bad, and by any other attribute. One can, sooner than later,  
be aware that this beingness is always there with him, and remains unaffected  
with the advancement of the age. It is the Spacious Womb of all creation, all  
form. We need to this diligently with perseverance till the Goal is reached.  
Sri Bhagwan has assured that many have attained the Goal following Vichara  
unswervingly, and therefore, there is no reason why we cannot.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Dear Devotees,   
We say, as a matter of fact, that this world is transitory, ephemeral. But how  
do we know that the world is transitory? Sri Bhagwan has taught that unless  
something permanent is held, the transitory nature of the world cannot be  
understood, cannot be ascertained. But alas! In the transitory world, that  
is, in the system of myriad names and forms, there is nothing whatever which  
is permanent. Isn't it? But we need not worry, for Sri Bhagwan has driven home  
the truth that we are the Self, and the Self alone is the Eternal Reality,  
Eternal Existence or Eternal Being. Has He not? And He has also revealed that  
we cannot deny our own existence, for every one of us knows, for certain, that  
we exist. Do we not? Therefore, out of great compassion for us, Sri Bhagwan  
repeatedly draws our attention to It, and instructs tirelessly to rivet our  
attention on the Eternal Reality, i.e., the Self.   
Hence, when we meditate on or think of 'I am', sense our presence and become  
aware of the accompanying 'stillness', warding off the intruding thoughts, we  
hold that which is permanent. This is the practice, or sadhana, but even  
during the practice, the unreal nature of the ego and transitory nature of the  
world begin to be gradually revealed, and one has the foretaste of ensuing  
bliss of the Atma-swarupa, beckoning one on and on to the mysterious depth  
into the Heart till the practice culminates in final Swarupa-Jnana.   
Thanks very much,   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Devotee: Should I then consider Sri Bhagwan as talking to me in a waking-  
dreaming-sleeping state?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Because your conscious experience is now limited to the  
duration of the extroversion of the mind, you call the present moment the  
waking state, whereas all the while your mind has been asleep to the Self, and  
therefore you are now really fast asleep.   
D: To me sleep is a mere blankness.   
Sri Bhagwan: That is so, because your waking state is mere effervescence of  
the restless mind.   
D: What I mean by blankness is that I am hardly aware of anything in my sleep;  
it is for me the same as non-existence.   
Sri Bhagwan: But you did exist during sleep.   
D: If I did, I was not aware of it.   
Sri Bhagwan: You do mean to say in all seriousness you ceased to exist during  
your sleep! (Laughing). If you went to sleep as Mr. X, did you get up from it  
as Mr. Y?   
D: I know my identity, perhaps, by an act of memory.   
Sri Bhagwan: Granting that, how is it possible unless there is continuity of  
awareness.   
D: But I was unaware of that awareness.   
Sri Bhagwan: No. Who says you are unaware in sleep? It is your mind. But  
there was no mind in your sleep? Of what value is the testimony of the mind  
about your existence or experience during sleep? Seeking the testimony of the  
mind to disprove your existence or awareness during sleep is just like calling  
your son?s evidence to disprove your birth!

Sri Bhagwan: Do you remember, I told you once previously that existence and  
awareness are not two different things but one and the same? Well, if for any  
reason you feel constrained to admit the fact that you existed in sleep be  
sure you were also aware of that existence.   
What you were really unaware of in sleep is your bodily existence. You are  
confounding this bodily awareness with the true Awareness of the Self which   
is eternal. Prajnana, which is the source of ?I-am?-ness, ever subsists  
unaffected by the three transitory states of the mind, thus enabling you to  
retain your identity unimpaired.   
Prajnana is also beyond the three states, because it can subsist without them  
and in spite of them.   
It is that Reality that you should seek during your so called waking state by  
tracing the aham-vritti to its Source. Intense practice in this enquiry will  
reveal that the mind and its three states are unreal and that you are the  
eternal, infinite consciousness of Pure   
Being, the Self or the Heart.

Know that reality is so subtle, it cannot be known and realized through the  
exertions of the jiva's intellect, but only through the grace of God, which  
manifests when you offer yourself up with love at His Feet.   
V. 648, GVK   
Do not wander and search, having failed to find the abiding state in spite of  
receiving tuition in all the arts and sciences, and thoroughly mastering them.  
The supreme state is to abide wholly as the reality that remains enshrined as  
the form of love.   
V. 649, GVK   
Dear devotees, the supreme state cannot be attained by mere exertion of the  
intellect, but only by being still, without words, in the state of mauna or  
the silence. Jnana, Bhakti and Yoga must culminate into being still in the  
State of Silence of the Self. It alone is offering oneself up with love at His  
Feet. Love for the Self or the Atma-swarupa is the essential cause so that the  
Grace is added, for Grace is the primary cause which make the realization of  
the Atma-swarupa happen.

Quote from Sri Nishtha: "The quest for Self-Realisation is no doubt a noble cause. But for many  
aspirants it will, perhaps cruelly, become just another veiling. Unless the  
quest directly investigates and challenges the 'I', the 'me', that seeks Self-  
Realisation, then ones efforts paradoxically reinforce the imaginary ego.   
Maharshi's vichara does exactly that; investigates and challenges the 'I' that  
seeks Self-Realisation. Maharshi's Teachings are not for building a better  
you, nor for manufacturing a new "spiritual" identity. His is an investigation  
of the very person that thinks they have to undertake sadhana and achieve  
Self-Realisation.   
That said, Maharshi's Teachings are not nihilistic. When identification with  
the I-thought ends, Self, the non-conceptual pure 'I', remains"   
"Q.: Will not my present visit to you bring it (Self-Realisation) about?   
M.: What is to be brought about? To whom? Consider; investigate.   
M.: If we turn inwards enquiring "Where is this I?" all thoughts (including  
the I-thought) will come to an end and Self-knowledge will then spontaneously  
shine forth.   
Q.: Grant me that my mind troubles me no more.   
M.: Find out whether there is such a thing as mind. If so, what is its form?  
Does it have a moustache and a beard?   
Q.: What should we do to make the mind still?   
M.: First let the mind be caught hold of and brought here, then we shall  
consider ways and means of stilling it."   
Dear Sri Nishtha, yes, I wholly agree to what you have insightfully observed.  
This is a very beautiful post. Thank you. Anil

Bhagwan Sri Ramana: "If the mind, which is the cause of all knowledge and action subsides, the  
perception of the world will cease. Just as knowledge of the rope, which is  
the base, will not be obtained unless the knowledge of the snake, the  
superimposition, goes, so the realization of the Self, which is the base, will  
not be obtained unless the perception of the world, which is a  
superimposition, ceases."   
'Who Am I?' Essay Version   
Dear Devotees,   
What is the perception of the world? It is chiefly the feeling of differences,  
which is alien to the Self or the Atma-swarupa. Is it not? For, realization  
and the Experience of the Self is that in which everything whatsoever shines  
as the Self or the Swarupa. This is the Experience without the experiencer,  
that is, the Self alone experiences the Self. Therefore, only merging in the  
blazing Light of the Self and remaining as One is alone our Natural Life. The  
Life, in truth, is synonym with the Self, for the Self is the Absolute  
Awareness and Absolute Existence, which alone is the True Life, and which is  
the only Life, for every other thing is insentient and is therefore non-Life.  
The sight of the world and the feeling of differences, being alien to the  
Swarupa, veils It in the same way as the perception of a snake veils the rope.  
Therefore, the perception of the world and the feeling of differences are mere  
appearances imagined within the Self or the Swarupa.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Dear Devotees and Seekers,   
What is 'Aham', and what is 'aham-vritti? Bhagwan Sri Ramana has taught that  
the word 'Aham' Itself is suggestive, for It comprises of the alphabet 'A' and  
'HA', which are the first and the last alphabets of the Sanskrit Alphabet,  
conveying that 'Aham' comprises all there is. That is, 'Aham' signifies  
Existence Itself.   
As for the 'aham-vritti', Sri Bhagwan has revealed that 'I'-ness or the 'I  
Am'-ness, by usage, is known as 'aham-vritti'. Though it is known as the  
'aham-vritti', He has given a great clue that the 'aham-vritti' is not quite a  
vritti like the other vrittis of the mind, because unlike the other vrittis  
which have no essential interrelation, the 'aham-vritti' is essentially  
related to each and every vritti of the mind. Moreover, without the 'aham-  
vritti' there can be no other vritti whatever, but the 'aham-vritti' can  
subsist by itself without depending on any other vritti of the mind.  
Therefore, we must know that the 'aham-vritti' is fundamentally different from  
the other vrittis of the mind.   
**Dear devotees and seekers, where from arises the 'I'-ness or the 'I am'-ness  
in us? Where else but from the Heart (Heart Am I), Which is the  
undifferentiated Consciousness of the Pure Being. Therefore, the primary datum  
of all our experiences, that is, 'I'-ness or the 'I am'-ness arises from the  
Heart. So long as the 'aham-vritti' has not connected with the other vrittis  
of the mind after arising from the Heart, that is, by itself, in itself, that  
is, per se, it is Sudha-Sattva in character.  
Sri Bhagwan has revealed that it is in this Sudha-Sattva swarupa,  
uncontaminated by rajas and tamas, that the 'I' (pure ego) appears to subsist  
in the Jnani, which is like a burnt rope which retains its form but cannot be  
used to tie something with it.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Sri Bhagwan: Just as water in the pot reflects the enormous sun within the  
narrow limits of the pot, even so the vasanas or latent tendencies of the mind  
of the individual, acting as the reflecting medium, catch the all-pervading,  
infinite light of Consciousness arising from the heart and present in the form  
of a reflection the phenomenon called the mind. Seeing only this reflection,  
the ajnani is deluded into the belief that he is a finite being, the jiva. If  
the mind becomes introverted through enquiry into the source of aham-vritti,  
the vasanas become extinct, and in the absence of the reflecting medium the  
phenomenon of reflection, namely, the mind, also disappears being absorbed  
into the light of the one Reality, the Heart.   
This is the sum and substance of all that an aspirant needs to know. What is  
imperatively required of him is an earnest and one-pointed enquiry into the  
source of aham-vritti.   
Dear Devotees,   
His is a firm Assurance, which means a lot to His devotees, that the process  
of Self-enquiry will itself reveal that the alteration of the three states of  
the mind, as well as the three states themselves, belong to the world of  
phenomena which cannot affect, inward enquiry, for the Self-enquiry, He has  
taught, is possible only through intense introversion of the mind. What is  
finally realised as a result of such enquiry into the source of ahamvritti or  
the 'I'-ness or the 'I Am'-ness, is verily the Heart as the undifferentiated  
light of Pure Consciousness, into which the reflected light of the mind is  
completely absorbed, revealing its non-existence or non-being. And when the  
mind disappears, that is, when the reflected light of the mind is completely  
absorbed, the world, body, time, space, et al, also disappear, for has anyone  
seen anyone of these without the mind?   
Pranam,

Sri V. Ganesan: I would like to share an incident of great significance that took place when I  
was there. After the speeches, I sat at Robert's feet (Sri Robert Adams).  
Another person was also there, a John Wilkins, I think, who had been Robert's  
friend for more than twenty years. Out of the blue, John suddenly asked,  
"Robert, I want you to tell me: what is the truth and what is untruth? What is  
reality and unreality? I do not want you to quote from the scriptures or use  
any philosophical jargon. You must make me experience these right now at your  
feet."   
I was thrilled because I wanted to know how Robert was going to answer these  
difficult questions. Robert looked happy for some time and then became very  
serious. He looked at John and asked, "Who are you?" John thought that Robert  
had forgotten him because of the disease he had. He replied, "I am John  
Wilkins." Robert gave him the most gracious smile that I have ever seen and  
said, "I AM is the truth and John Wilkins is the untruth. I AM is the reality  
and John Wilkins is the unreality." Everyone went into a state of inner  
stillness. This was not a mere answer; it was a statement that transported  
everyone into a state of deep silence of the mind.

That's it and that is the essence of all the scriptural readings. It is a very  
simple one but the unconscious patterns of the mind that makes it go outward  
in order to find security and peace in outward things or in case of  
spiritual practices finding comfort in various mental states makes us move  
away from the ultimate reality. Thanks for sharing this wonderful incident

Sri V. Ganesan: That, which arises in the physical body as 'I', is the mind. The 'I' feeling  
arises from the Heart or core of being. By enquiring 'Who am I?' the attention  
goes within and hence is diverted from thoughts. Perseverance in this practice  
gives strength to the mind to go to the source and be absorbed in the Self.  
Following sattvic (pure) principles such as eating simple, nutritious food in  
moderate quantity, and observing simple rules of good conduct, is most  
conducive to the development of pure qualities of the mind. This in turn helps  
one to pursue Self Enquiry without hindrance and without giving room to any  
form rising in the Self. All vasanas (tendencies) will be dissolved. One  
should firmly and unceasingly focus on the one Self. One should unswervingly  
put the teachings of the master into constant practice. Self is bliss.  
Whenever the mind experiences happiness as in deep sleep, samadhi, or when a  
desired object is obtained, it is due to the mind relinquishing its desire and  
being the bliss of the Self. Like a wise man who never leaves the shade, thus  
avoiding the scorching sun, one should always be absorbed in the Self and not  
allow the mind to be externalized into activity. The Self, like the sun, is  
unaffected by any activity of the forms of life it sustains. To keep the mind  
constantly turned inward and to be thus as the Self, alone is atma vichara, or  
Self Enquiry. If the mind subsides, all else will subside. To be and to remain  
in the Self, or one's true nature, alone is liberation or mukti.   
Dear devotees, Sri V. Ganesan's understanding and insights are wonderful and  
profound. Is it not? For, in my view, the above observation is the essence of  
the Teaching of Sri Bhagwan Ramana's Atma-vichara or the Self-enquiry.

**" Don't regard the abidance in the 'I am' as a part-time activity. You must  
have a life-long commitment to get yourself established in it.   
At all times keep moving back to the 'I am', your source, and do let anything  
divert or distract you from this.   
The 'I am' in its absolute purity is the infinite and formless, so when you  
abide in it you discover the infinite eye of the Self.   
If you can hold on to the knowledge 'I am' at all times, no further practice  
or initiation will be necessary."   
Sri Annamalai Swami.**   
Dear devotees, "I am so and so" is the ego. "So and so" of the "I am so and  
so" is the mind rising from the pure and pristine consciousness 'I Am'.  
Therefore, practice is to stay in the 'I Am' for as long as possible in  
attempt after attempt. Such abidance obliterates predispositions (vasanas)  
enabling an aspiran to stay in the pristine and natural state progressively  
for longer periods until vasanas are totally destroyed and such a one attains  
perfect Self-Awareness. Since by staying for longer periods destroys  
predispositions or vasanas are destoryed, entrenched deep or shallow, and such  
purified mind sees its own real nature, a fully flowered and expanded mind no  
longer rises and says 'this' anymore and therefore remains at peace with  
itself, like the clear sky. Hence Sri Annamalai has exhorted devotees and  
seekers to keep returning back Home, that is, to keep returning back to the 'I  
Am', our Source, and not to allow anything whatsoever to divert or distract  
them from this supremely beneficial practice.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Devotee: In what sense is happiness or bliss (ananda) our real nature?   
 **Sri Bhagwan: Perfect bliss is Brahman.   
Perfect peace is of the Self.   
That alone exists and is consciousness. That which is called happiness is only  
the nature of Self; Self is not other than perfect happiness. That which is  
called happiness alone exists. Knowing that fact and abiding in the state of  
Self, enjoy bliss eternally.   
If a man thinks that his happiness is due to external causes and his  
possessions, it is reasonable to conclude that his happiness must increase  
with the increase of possessions and diminish in proportion to their  
diminution. Therefore if he is devoid of possessions, his happiness should be  
nil.   
What is the real experience of man?   
Does it conform to this view?   
In deep sleep man is devoid of possessions, including his own body.   
Instead of being unhappy he is quite happy. Everyone desires to sleep soundly.  
The conclusion is that happiness is inherent in man and is not due to external  
causes.   
One must realize the Self in order   
to open the store of unalloyed happiness.   
 **Therefore, dear devotees and seekers, only way to enjoy the happiness  
perennially and unobstructed is to realize the Self by raising the ultimate  
question 'Who Am I?', which alone will open the store of unalloyed happiness.  
There is no other way.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Bhagwan Sri Ramana:  **" Meditation is your true nature now. You call it meditation, because there  
are other thoughts distracting you. When these thoughts are dispelled, you  
remain alone, i.e., in the state of meditation free from thoughts; and that is  
your real nature which you are now attempting to gain by keeping away other  
thoughts. Such keeping away of other thoughts is now called meditation. When  
the practice becomes firm, the real nature shows itself as the true  
meditation."   
Dear Devotees,   
Sri J. Krishnamurti has also once observed profoundly that meditation is both  
the means as well as the End. This is indeed a beautiful line. However, why do  
we wish to meditate at all? Why is it so necessary, imperative? Because dhyana  
leads to Jnana, because dhyana is prelude to Self-realization. Remember, Holy  
Gita has taught us **' Atma samstham manah krtva',** that is, to fix the mind  
in the Self or the Atma. Has it not? But how can we fix the mind in the Self  
so long as the mind is assailed by the thought-wave? It is well-nigh  
impossible to fix the mind in the Self ( **Atma samstha** ) as long as it is  
clouded by the thoughts. **Meditation eliminates all thoughts, and when all  
thoughts are eliminated, the 'manah' (mind) becomes 'Atma samstha' (fixed in  
the Self).**   
 **The great Sage Bhagwan Sri Ramana has taught that meditation, truly  
speaking, is the Atmanishtha (to be fixed in the Self). But when thoughts  
cross the mind and an effort is made to eliminate them the effort is usually  
termed meditation. Nevertheless, Atmanishtha alone is our real nature.**   
Natural State, that is, remaining as we ever truly are, is the Goal.  
Meditation facilitates only that. Yet, meditating on anything other than the  
Self is the indirect method, whereas Vichara or the Enquiry is the direct  
method though the object of both is the same, that is, Self-realization.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

**Never to be heedless of one 's own all-perfect, pure Self is the acme of  
yoga, wisdom, and all other forms of spiritual practice.   
Even though the mind wanders restlessly, involved in external matters, and so  
is forgetful of its own Self, one should remain alert and remember: 'The body is not I. Who am I?'   
Enquire in this way, turning the mind   
backward to its primal state.   
The enquiry 'Who am I?' is the   
only method of putting an end to all misery and ushering in supreme  
Beatitude.**   
Words of Grace

Sri V. Ganesan: The day he understood his realization, he went incognito. The outward symbol  
of his becoming Self realized was his obscurity. He lived alone - happy to be  
immersed in the Self all the time. After Bhagavan's mahasamadhi in 1950 and  
until 1967, many did not even know if Natanananda was still alive. Though he  
stayed in a cottage in Tiruvannamalai, no one knew where he was. Like most of  
the old devotees, I too thought that he had passed away.   
 **I had spent seven years in the ashram when suddenly one day my friend Dorab  
Framji asked me, "Do you know Sadhu Natanananda is alive?" I jumped with joy  
because I loved his book, Spiritual Instruction. I paid him a visit. He was an  
austere man with nothing in his room except for a few   
loincloths. He blessed me and asked, "What are you doing? Are you practicing  
Self Enquiry?" I replied, "I am not capable of doing Self Enquiry. I only  
chant Arunachala Siva, Arunachala Siva." His face was red with rage. I was  
taken aback because this was my very first meeting with him and I was  
accustomed to people indulging me whenever they met me. Not Natanananda! He  
was a stern and serious man. He raged, "What a fool you are! What do you think  
you have come to Bhagavan for? For what function has he chosen you? It is only  
to make you like him! Read his Forty Verses on Reality, practice Self Enquiry,  
be the truth. That is why you have been chosen!" I was stunned in disbelief.**   
Source: Sri Ramana Periya Puranam   
Dear devotees, for one who wishes earnestly to realize and be the Truth that  
he really is, Self-enquiry is of supreme significance and of utmost  
importance. Therefore, such a one should read the Scripture of the Atma-  
vichara, that is, the 'Forty Verses On Reality' and the Enquiry 'Who Am I?' as  
contained in the small booklet 'Nan Yar', and practice Enquiry sincerely with  
love, and understand that those who are thus following His Teaching are all  
chosen. There is no reason whatever to doubt it.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Sri Robert Adams: "I want to let you in on a little secret. There are no problems. There are no  
problems. There never were any problems, there are no problems today, and  
there will never be any problems. Problems just mean that the world isn't  
turning out the way you want it to. But in truth, there are no problems.  
Everything is unfolding as it should. Everything is right. You have to forget  
about yourself and expand your consciousness until you become the whole  
universe. The Reality in back of the universe is Pure Awareness. It has no  
problems. And you are That."   
"If you identify yourself with body, then there is a problem, because your  
body always gets into trouble of some kind. But if you learn to forget about  
your body and your mind, where is here a problem? In other words, leave your  
body alone. Take just enough care of it. Exercise it a little, feed it right  
foods, but don't think about it too much. **Keep your mind on Reality. Merge  
your mind with Reality. And you will experience Reality. You will live in a  
world without problems. The world may appear to have problems to others, but  
not to you. You will see things differently, from a higher point of view. "   
Dear devotees, **turning our attention towards the Self by 180 degrees from  
thoughts, desires and sense-perceptions in perfect, unwavering Self-attention  
is to keep our minds on the Reality, merging our minds with Reality, abiding  
in the Reality and experiencing only and only the Reality. Then we know that  
the Consciousness not only expands, but verily we are the Pure Awareness  
Itself free from all problems whatsoever. Enquiry and Self-attention must go  
on, come what may, if we are to fulfil the purpose for which we came there in  
the illusory world and here to the Lotus Feet of Bhagwan Sri Ramana Maharshi.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Sri Paul Brunton: "In the presence of this Sage one felt security and inward peace. The  
spiritual radiations which emanated from him were all-penetrating. I learnt to  
recognise in his person the sublime truths which he taught, while I was no  
less hushed into reverence by his incredibly sainted atmosphere. He possessed  
a deific personality which defies description. I might have taken shorthand  
notes of the discourses of the Sage: I might even print the record of his  
speech: but the most important part of his utterances, the subtle and silent  
flavour of spirituality which emanated from him, can never be reported. If,  
therefore, I burn literary incense before his bust, it is but [a] mere  
fraction of the tribute I ought to pay him."   
**" One could not forget that wonderful pregnant smile of his, with its hint  
of wisdom and peace won from suffering and experience. He was the most  
understanding man I have ever known; you could be sure always of some words  
from him that would smooth your way a little, and that word always verified  
what your deepest feeling told you already."   
"The words of this Sage still flame out in my memory like beacon lights. 'I  
pluck golden fruit from rare meetings with wise men', wrote trans-Atlantic  
Emerson in his diary, and it is certain that I plucked whole basketfuls during  
my talks with this man. **Our best philosophers of Europe could not hold a  
candle to him. But the inevitable hour of parting came. "   
Source: The Maharshi and His Message   
Dear devotees, I extracted the above three passages from Sri Paul Brunton's  
book in order only to say that ever growing number of devotees and seekers of  
Truth from all over the world are visiting Sri Ramanasramam and other Ashrams  
in His Name, and are following His Teaching of the Enquiry and Surrender, the  
two methods He enjoined, because of this veracity, Sri Brunton speaks of. Yes,  
His holy Words of Grace, undoubtedly verify what our deepest feeling kept  
whispering intuitively to us already. Other than His magnetic Gaze and mighty  
Impersonality, it is certainly this resonance of His holy Utterances with our  
deepest feeling which drew and established us to His Lotus Feet and compelled  
us to follow His Teaching with love, sincerity and earnestness. Is it not?   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Quote from Sri Ravi: "By the 'will of Rama' we are doing fine...yes,I have not been posting  
anything here for sometime now...not because someone has 'offended' my  
sensibilities and certainly not you!...No brother...perhaps I have shared  
enough. ..perhaps not even that!...There was no inner prompting to do so."   
Dear Sri Ravi,   
Thanks so much, dear Sri Ravi bhai saheb. I became a little despondent seeing  
your prolonged absence from the forum, and I thought that, may be, something  
said here might not have gone down well with you.   
So, my will synchronized with Sri Rama's Will and bhai saheb came!   
Quote: "What is the essence of spiritual sadhana?...Is it not to drop the sense of  
'doership' ? Any effort that strengthens the 'doership' and perpetuates it is  
counterproductive...so,the very first step in awakening is to realize that  
sadhana is something that gets done (and this is the breeze of Grace that  
carries one)...   
So,the very nature of so called 'Effort' is quite different than what is  
understood in worldly parlance...and the paradox is that although effort is  
called for, effort keeps one off the mark!...until the effort and struggle is  
transmuted to one of pure yearning and Shraddha...and it is this shraddha that  
is the very essence of Sadhana...and this yearning and shraddha arises  
through the causeless Grace of the Divine...   
There is absolutely no new 'insight' that one has to gain. ..it is always the  
same...that only the crying baby gets its milk...yearning and shraddha are the  
very essence of sadhana and satsangha is the only way to discover this in  
ourselves."   
Yes, I have not missed the profundity of what you have said as above. The idea  
of 'doership' is concomitant with the 'I am this physical body' idea. So yes,  
beautifully said bhai saheb: 'any effort or the sadhana that strengthens the  
'doership' is counterproductive? and is not helpful.   
Dear Sri Ravi, I have always known, even before knowing Him as the Guru-tattva  
watching and guiding from within, that a sadhana devoid of Shradha, yearning  
and love is dry and mechanical, and therefore, cannot take one far in the  
realm of spirituality.   
Thanks very much, dear Sri Ravi bhai saheb.   
Pranam,

Anilbhai,   
Thanks for your loving response.   
" I became a little despondent seeing your prolonged absence from the forum,  
and I thought that, may be, something said here might not have gone down well  
with you.   
So, my will synchronized with Sri Rama's Will and bhai saheb came! "   
Everything happens by 'the will of Rama' indeed...the 'my will' is also 'will  
of Rama' only...This is how Sri Ramakrishna puts it: "Suppose you are cooking rice in a pot, with potato, egg-plant, and other  
vegetables. After a while the potatoes, eggplant, rice, and the rest begin to  
jump about in the pot. They seem to say with pride: 'We are moving! We are  
jumping!' The children see it and think the potatoes, egg-plant, and rice are  
alive and so they jump that way. But the elders, who know, explain to the  
children that the vegetables and the rice are not alive; they jump not of  
themselves, but because of the fire under the pot; if you remove the burning  
wood from the hearth, then they will move no more. Likewise the pride of man,  
that he is the doer, springs from ignorance. Men are powerful because of the  
power of God. All becomes quiet when that burning wood is taken away. The  
puppets dance well on the stage when pulled by a wire, but they cannot move  
when the wire snaps".   
The Yearning and Shraddha are themselves the sadhana...this is the gist of the  
previous post...not that sadhana is to be done with yearning and shraddha.This  
must be familiar ground for you.   
Namaskar.

**Dear Sri Ravi,   
The parables, simple tales and anecdotes that Sri Paramhamsa and Sri Bhagwan  
narrated to drive home their Message were really wonderful. Yes, how  
beautiful! If God-essence is withdrawn, If the Life is withdrawn, we know only  
too well what happens to the body-mind complex! The body is not allowed to be  
kept in the house, and even near and dear ones feel that they got polluted by  
merely touching it. Before coming to Sri Bhagwan I used to wonder as to why  
the man does what they do, amassing wealth, running after material things,  
always hankering for more even though they may be possessing an estate. It's  
all Rama's Will! And Rama's Will alone will maake them see the error of their  
ways.   
Quote: "The Yearning and Shraddha are themselves the sadhana...this is the gist of  
the previous post...not that sadhana is to be done with yearning and  
shraddha."   
Yes, bhai saheb, as I see it now in retrospect, I find that the yearning took  
me to Sri Bhagwan, and deep Sraddha enabled me to realize His Grace in the  
heart. And believe me, after coming to Sri Bhagwan, the existential question  
'Who really Am I?' arose involuntarily, of its own accord, and I heard its  
echo deep within, even before I knew much about Him and the Inquiry, for I had  
read only the small booklet 'Who Am I?' till then. I have always known  
myself as a devotee only, rather than a seeker, who pursues his Guru's  
Teaching invoking His Presence, that is, seeking to remain as 'I Am' in the  
Now.   
Thanks very much, Dear Sri Ravi bhai saheb, for a very beautiful post.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

**Don 't regard the abidance in the 'I am' as a part-time activity. You must  
have a life-long commitment to get yourself established in it.   
At all times keep moving back to the 'I am', your source, and do not let  
anything divert or distract you from this.   
The 'I am' in its absolute purity is the infinite and formless, so when you  
abide in it you discover the infinite eye of the Self.   
If you can hold on to the knowledge ?I am? at all times, no further practice  
or initiation will be necessary.   
Sri Annamalai Swami**   
 **The intensity with which you meditate "I am' will take you to your real  
Self as there is nothing else other than it.   
To constantly mediate 'I am' is the only way. If this is not continuous enough  
the other part of the mind becomes predominant.   
If you become irreversibly established in the 'I am' you will never know  
ignorance again.   
The 'I am' is present in all and not confined only to those who follow this  
particular teaching and Guru.

**Sri Robert Adams**   
 **What we use here sometimes which is a very good beginning is the I-am  
meditation. You relax your body and you inhale and you say, "I", and you  
exhale and you say, "am, I-am." You can do this while you're waking, while  
you're walking, while you're washing dishes, while you're resting. What it  
does is it makes your mind one pointed, so it'll stop thinking. In other  
words, you use whatever method you have to, to still your mind. The whole  
secret is to quiet your mind, to keep it from thinking, to keep it from being  
active. Your mind is a bunch of waves. You want to stop the waves and you want  
your mind to become still and the fastest way to do that is by self-inquiry or  
by observing your thoughts, watching your thoughts, becoming the witness to  
your thoughts.

**Dear Sri Atmavichar, yes, if an aspirant can hold on to the 'KNOWLEDGE 'I  
AM'' always (duration will increase with practice), indeed nothing more is  
needed, for can there a be greater Portal, which is always palpable, to the  
Atma-swarupa or the Being? However, it is worth mention here that 'I Am' is  
not a thought, or an intellectual construct of mere two words. It is  
Knowledge. And therefore we are being asked to be that Knowledge, that is, to  
be one with the Knowledge 'I Am'. Thank you.   
Pranam   
 Anil

**D: The Westerners look on the mind as the highest principle, whereas the  
Easterners think the contrary--why?   
Sri Bhagwan: Where psychology ends, there philosophy begins. This is  
experience; the mind is born; we see it; even without the mind we exist. There  
is everyone's experience to prove it.   
Q: In deep sleep I do not seem to exist.   
Sri Bhagwan: You say so when awake. It is the mind which speaks now. You exist  
in deep sleep beyond mind.   
Talk-126   
 **Dear Devotees,   
The precept 'Never mind the mind' is a very subtle and profound teaching. It  
is because of the mind alone that we perceive ourselves separated from  
everything else and see differences everywhere in the universe. We see the  
form of our bodies and believe erroneously that all other forms, which are all  
creations of the mind, are different from us. Ever-changing mind, which is  
only bundle of thoughts as we understand it, cannot be real. So, Sri Bhagwan  
kept on driving home the subtle teaching that if we take the mind to be real,  
it will be very difficult to cease to dance according to its ever-changing  
tunes and moods. Hence, indeed, not minding the mind, that is, and remaining  
vigilant and alert to our true nature as the awareness itself, as 'I AM' 'NOW'  
, is one of the most powerful and effective spiritual practices.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

**You must always remember this, that no matter what you 're going through, no  
matter what appears to have come upon you that you consider negative, it's a  
blessing in disguise. Sounds strange, but true. It's a blessing in disguise,  
believe it or not. If you handle it in the right way, and you work through it  
by not reacting to it, it will turn into something so beautiful you can't  
imagine. I can assure you of this. But, if you react you may win, you may get  
your point across. That will only last a short while. Then you'll have to go  
through the condition again and again, perhaps with other people, and you'll  
never know why you suffer so much. The choice therefore is yours. Whom shall I  
follow this day, God or mammon. God of course is consciousness. Mammon is the  
world. That's the only freedom you've got, to make a choice whom you will  
follow. If you turn within yourself and realize your identity you'll be safe.  
If you weep with the world, you will continue to weep. It will never end.   
Sri Robert Adams   
Dear devotees, this was, in fact, the Teaching or the Upadesa that Sri Robert  
Adams received from Sri Bhagwan. Not reacting to a situation in life is  
helpful in all kinds of spiritual practices for all aspirants whether it is  
Jnana, Bhakti Yoga or the Karma. Reaction is always mental and only goes on  
strengthening and giving fresh lease of life to the ego. Yes, choice is ours.  
But we have already chosen to turn within and realize our identity as  
Awareness, which is always present as 'I AM', "NOW".   
Sri Robert Adams: Sri Ramana Maharshi said to me, "The only spiritual life you need is not to  
react". To be calm is the greatest asset in the world. When you are perfectly  
calm, time stops. There is no time, karma stops, samskaras stop. Everything  
becomes null and void.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

**Devotee: Why do we see such permanency and constancy in the waking state?   
Sri Bhagwan Ramana: It is seen on account of wrong ideas. When someone says  
that he took a bath in the same river twice, he is wrong because when he  
bathed for the second, time, the river was not the same as it was when he  
bathed for the first time. Somebody may say that he is seeing the same fruit  
every day, but really, a lot of changes are taking place in the fruit. On  
seeing the brightness of a flame, a man says that he sees the same flame, but  
the flame is changing every second. As the oil gets less and less, the flame  
keeps on changing. The waking state is also like this. The stationary  
appearance is an error of perception.   
Devotee: Whose is the error?   
Sri Bhagwan: Pramata [the knower].   
Devotee: From where did the knower come?   
Sri Bhagwan: On account of the error of perception. In fact, the knower and  
his false knowledge appear simultaneously, and when the knowledge of the Self  
is obtained, they disappear simultaneously.   
Devotee: From where did the knower and his ignorance come?   
Sri Bhagwan: Who is asking this question?   
Devotee: I.   
Sri Bhagwan: Find out that 'I' and all your doubts will be solved. Just as in  
a dream, a false knower, knowledge and known rise up, in the waking state the  
same process operates. In both states, on knowing this 'I' you know  
everything, and nothing remains to be known. If, in the waking state, there is  
enquiry into the 'I', everything can be understood and nothing else will  
remain to be known. In deep sleep knower, knowledge and known are absent. At  
the time of experiencing the true 'I' they will also not exist. Whatever you  
see happening in the waking state happens only to the knower, and since the  
knower is unreal, nothing in fact ever happens.   
Source: The Power of the Presence, Part One   
Dear Devotees,   
All experiences and whatever we see happening in the waking state happen only  
to the one who sees them, that is, to the knower, and the knower himself arose  
on account of the error of perception and is therefore unreal! So, indeed,  
nothing in fact ever happens.   
Mind itself is changing and unsteady. So, how do we know the always changing,  
impermanent and ephemeral nature of the forms and the world, including, of  
course, thoughts and emotions? Only the eternal and unchanging in us can  
recognize the impermanent as the impermanent. Isn't it? That eternal,  
however, is always within the experience of everyone as awareness ?I Am?, here  
and now.   
Remaining conscious and present wherever we are, we must always seek to sense  
the 'I Am'. If we remain alert and present we can keep the thinking at bay for  
a while which can always be extended by practice. So, keeping the attention on  
'I Am', without thinking, we become aware of the stillness. If we are still  
enough within, with full attention on the 'I Am', identification with the ego-  
mind ceases, and we are in the Presence of God! 'I Am' is the Self or God.  
This, in my view, is the import of the Teaching as taught above.   
Pranam,   
Anil

**An excerpt from Sri Robert Adams ' "Satsang":  **Chalkboard**   
 **People ask the silly question, "When does the soul come into the birth, in  
the body? The third month, the fourth month, the sixth month?" Try to  
understand this teaching, there is no soul that comes into anybody. You have  
always existed. The Self is the Self. When you take on the body you are still  
the Self.**   
 **As the body grows through experiences you are still the Self. As the body  
appears to go through diseases, illnesses, situations in this world you are  
still the Self. When the body gets old and seems to die you are the same Self  
that existed before you were born.   
It's like a chalkboard. The chalkboard exists and you draw your baby being  
born on the chalkboard. Then you draw a picture of a baby growing up on the  
chalkboard. Then you draw a picture of the baby having cancer when he becomes  
a man or a woman. Then you draw a picture of the person dying on the  
chalkboard.**   
 **From the very beginning the chalkboard was there. The chalkboard was always  
there. The pictures were different but the chalkboard was always there. In  
reality you are like the chalkboard. You are the Self, pure intelligence. The  
Self can never die and was never born. There is no disease that can affect it.  
It is all-pervading. And you are That. You have to begin to feel this.   
You have to let go of the clinging to the body. By letting go I mean, do not  
feel that you are being persecuted, that you are being laughed at, that  
something is wrong with you. That you have any sickness or diseases. Always  
try to understand when this happens to you. Who has these things? The image on  
the chalkboard. It is the image that has these problems not you. You are  
totally free. You have always been free and you will always be free. There  
never was a time when you were not free. So it's wrong identification.  
Identify with the reality.   
This is how you should look at your everyday affairs, at your business. Look  
at your home life. Look at the world, look at what is happening in the world  
the same way. Images! Everything is images. The light of the self appears to  
cause these images to take form and to do whatever it has to do. But there is  
only the Self, this is the reality and the images do not even exist.   
We don't even say, "They appear to exist." For when you think they appear to  
exist you're giving them value, you're giving them power. You're believing in  
them as if they were reality. So you have to ask the question. "To whom do  
they exist? To whom do these images exist? They exist to me. I feel them." As  
soon as you say this to yourself immediately the answer should come to you. It  
is the I, the I-thought that feels the images not you. You are free and clear,  
you have absolutely nothing to do with the I-thought.   
Now when you have done this you have separated the disease the problems where  
they may seem to be from yourself haven't you? Because the I-thought is out  
here some place. It has nothing to do with you. The I-thought feels sickness,  
it feels a headache. The I-thought feels that when something good happens  
you're happy in this world. That is all the I- thought that feels this. So you  
just watch. You observe.   
As you keep doing something like this as you understand what I'm talking about  
you will notice that the pain disappears. For after all who has the pain? The  
I-thought, not you. Therefore look at yourself as two separate entities, this  
will help. You look at yourself as the I-thought which goes through the world  
and has all kinds of experiences in the world, good and bad, rich and poor,  
sick and healthy. And the self which is absolute reality and is free and clear  
of everything.   
This simply means that what you call sickness or disease or a problem is  
outside of your jurisdiction. It appears to exist by itself, it is not you.  
You have absolutely nothing to do with these things. Do not judge by  
appearances. Do not try to analyze or figure it out. For you get deeply  
involved when you do this. Even discussing this is not right. This is between  
you and yourself. There is absolutely nothing to discuss. Nothing to talk  
about.   
You remember the chalkboard analogy. And you realize that you've always been,  
you always will be. There never was a time when you were not and these other  
things were simply images that seemed to be superimposed on the self. So do  
not identify with the disease itself. Do not identify with the problem or  
whatever. Rather identify with the Self. The one that has always been. I am  
That!   
It's not really hard. As you go through everyday experiences always catch  
yourself. Always catch yourself thinking. Catch yourself worrying, being  
afraid. And immediately understand that you are the chalkboard. You are the  
absolute reality that has never changed. It has always been and will always  
be. You are perfect.

**Sri Robert Adams: "I love every one of you unequivocally, unconditionally, just the way you are.  
Ask yourself this question. Why come to satsang? Ask yourself this question.  
You come to hear Robert mumble? You come to hear Robert give a lecture? Or did  
you come to sit with Robert? Of course the last is the right answer. You came  
to sit with me in the Silence. In the Silence is where all the power is. In  
the Silence is where all the answers are. Because when we talk, when we use  
words, words have their place, but what can the words really do? Think of the  
billions and billions of words that have been spoken since the beginning of  
time. Where does it end for us, for humanity, for the world? Think of how many  
words you spoke since you got out of bed. Think of all the words you spoke.  
What have these words done for you? They are worthless. So sitting in the  
Silence is magic. This is when things begin to happen, wonderful things. Peace  
comes to you. Happiness comes to you all by itself. Joy comes to you. When you  
sit in the Silence you remember who you are. We come to see we are all one  
Self. What does this mean? It means we are not separate, we are One Self.  
Think of that. We are all the One Self."   
"Wonderful" is all I can say. Anil

**_Trace the 'I' to the Source_**   
 **As you try to understand these things, as you begin to ponder what I 'm  
talking about, you look for a way to remove everything from your mind, to  
empty the mind. You begin to inquire. To whom do all these thoughts come? To  
whom does the feeling of humanity come? To whom does this universe come? To  
whom does the ego come? And you smile to yourself. You keep still. You will  
soon realize that everything comes to you. It comes to you. I think these  
things. I believe this and I believe that. I feel hurt. I feel this way, I  
feel that way. A new revelation comes to you. "I." You begin to see that the  
I-thought is the culprit. From the moment you get out of bed in the morning,  
you begin with the 'I', and it never ends till you fall asleep. Therefore the  
only peace you ever get is when you are in deep sleep.   
When you are in deep sleep, the 'I' returns to the Heart, to the Source. There  
is nothing going on. Nothing happening. At that time you are unconsciously  
Self-realized. This is why when you get up in the morning and you say to  
yourself, "I slept well," you're talking about the 'I'. I slept well. What you  
really mean to say is, the 'I' wasn't interfering with your life. But as soon  
as you begin to think, you say, "I am late for work. I have to catch the bus.  
I have a headache. I have to eat breakfast." And you go on and on with this I,  
and it never stops. All day long it's I, I, I, I. Think about this. Am I not  
telling you the truth? You're always thinking about, "I this," and "I that."  
Till the night time comes again, you go to sleep. And again the 'I' goes back  
into the Source, into the Heart, and you're at peace once more. Until you wake  
up and it starts all over again. After doing this for a million years, you get  
to the stage when you'll ask yourself, "Who am I? What is this I? How did it  
arise? From whence does it come?" And this is the beginning of wisdom, when  
you inquire for the Source of the 'I'. You ultimately begin to trace the 'I'  
to the Source. When you do this finally, when the 'I' is in the Source, it is  
just like when you're in deep sleep, except that you're conscious.   
Think about this for a moment. In deep sleep you have no I, for it has  
returned to the Source. You're totally happy, but you're unconscious of it.  
When you attain what we call Self-realization, it means the 'I' has returned  
to the Source while you're awake. There's nobody left to think. There's no one  
left to worry, or to fret, or to be unhappy. You have merged with the  
Infinite, with the All-Pervading Brahman. If you understand this, and you  
practice this, you will become the happiest person in the world. For on the  
way to finding the I-Source you begin to feel happier and happier every day.  
The old thoughts melt away. The old you dissolves. You become free.   
Sri Robert Adams

**Sri V. Ganesan: "Established in the Self, Annamalai Swami started teaching Self Enquiry. A  
misconception prevalent at that time was that Self Enquiry was only for  
intellectuals and scholars, and that lay men did not have the capacity or  
alertness to turn their attention inwards and do it. Annamalai Swami taught  
even ordinary village folk how to do Self Enquiry. It is very thrilling how he  
taught them: "Since you say that you have forgotten your real Self, the only  
way is to go back to it. If you keep the light on all the time, darkness can  
never enter your room. Even if you open the door and invite the darkness to  
come in, it cannot enter. Darkness is just the absence of light. In the same  
way, the mind is a self-inflicted area of darkness in which the light of the  
Self has been deliberately shut off. So, go back to your own Self." Somebody  
said that since Self Enquiry was very difficult he was wondering whether he  
should practice some other path like devotion or karma and then come to Self  
Enquiry. Annamalai Swami was very categorical: "If you have some interest in  
the path of Self Enquiry you should follow it even if you feel that you are  
not very good at it. If you want to do Self Enquiry effectively and properly,  
you should stick to that method alone. Other methods may be good in their own  
right but they are not good as preparations for Self Enquiry. If you are  
serious about becoming a good violin player, you take lessons from a good  
teacher and practice as much as you can. If you encounter some difficulties,  
you do not switch over to clarinet for a few months! You stay with your chosen  
instrument and keep practicing till you get it right." See the simple, but  
vivid, example he uses! The best preparation for Self Enquiry is the practice  
of Self Enquiry. Even now there are villagers who guided by Annamalai Swami,  
are practicing Self Enquiry."   
Dear devotees, yes, the best preparation for the Self-inquiry is the practice  
of the Self-enquiry itself. Sri Muruganar, the Poet has sung in one of his  
verses that those who take to the pure path of Self-inquiry are never derailed  
because, like the Sun, this supremely Direct Path itself reveals to them its  
own unchallengeable clarity and uniqueness. Once taken up, the Self-enquiry  
never has to yield and change its course, because the Self is within the  
direct experience of everyone, albeit partially, but nonetheless, no one can  
deny. At least we have the 'I' to start with. Moreover, this path is compared  
to the Sun, it has been advised to take the Self to be the Sun, and the Self-  
inquiry to be its ray. How beautiful! If we hold the ray, can the Source  
remain elusive for long?   
Pranam,

**Dear devotees, what follows is one of the most wonderful reminiscences,  
written by one of Sri Bhagwan 's devotees, that I have ever read. Please go  
through it, for it is indeed His Grace that we keep on receiving His Guidance  
and Blessing on the path through such profound conversations and  
reminiscences, which further strengthen our resolve to go till the very end.  
Besides, we also obtain spiritual nourishment through these which sustain us  
in our pursuit of the Goal.   
Reminiscences of Ramana Maharshi -- Mercedes de Acosta: Mercedes de Acosta, a Spanish American who came to Sri Ramana in 1938, was a  
Hollywood socialite and scriptwriter for films. Long after meeting Sri Ramana  
she wrote the book Here Lies the Heart, which was dedicated to: Thou Spiritual  
Guide -Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi, the only completely egoless, world detached  
and pure being, I have ever known.   
A Search in Secret India by Paul Brunton had a profound influence on me. In it  
I learned for the first time about Ramana Maharshi, a great Indian saint and  
sage. It was as though some emanation of this saint was projected out of the  
book to me. For days and nights after reading about him I could not think of  
anything else. I became, as it were, possessed by him. I could not even talk  
of anything else. Nothing could distract me from the idea that I must go and  
meet this saint. The whole direction of my life turned towards India. I felt  
that I would surely go there.   
I had very little money, far too little to risk going to India, but something  
pushed me towards my goal. I went to the steamship company and booked myself  
one of the cheapest cabins on the S.S.Victoria.   
In Madras I hired a car, and so anxious was I to reach the Ashram that I did  
not go to bed and traveled by night, arriving about seven O'clock in the  
morning. I was very tired as I got out of the car in a small square in front  
of the Arunachaleswara Temple. The driver explained he could take me no  
further. I turned towards the Ashram in the hot sun along the two miles of  
dust-covered road to reach the abode of the Sage. As I walked that distance,  
deeply within myself I knew that I was moving towards the greatest experience  
of my life.   
When I first entered the hall, I perceived Bhagavan at once, sitting in the  
Buddha posture on his couch in the corner. At the same moment I felt overcome  
by some strong power in the hall, as if an invisible wind was pushing  
violently against me. For a moment I felt dizzy. Then I recovered myself. To  
my great surprise I suddenly heard an American voice calling out to me,  
"Hello, come in." It was the voice of an American named Guy Hague, who had  
already been with the Maharshi for a year. He came towards me, took my hand,  
leading me to a place beside him. I was able to look around the hall, but my  
gaze was drawn to Bhagavan, who was sitting absolutely straight looking  
directly in front of him.   
His eyes did not blink or move. Because they seemed so full of light I had the  
impression they were grey. I learned later that they were brown, although  
there have been various opinions as to the colour of his eyes. His body was  
naked except for a loincloth. As he sat there he seemed like a statue, and yet  
something extraordinary emanated from him. I had a feeling that on some  
invisible level I was receiving spiritual shocks from him, although his gaze  
was not directed towards me. He did not seem to be looking at anything, and  
yet I felt he could see and was conscious of the whole world. Hague whispered,  
"Bhagavan is in samadhi."   
After I had been sitting for sometime, Hague suggested that I go and sit near  
the Maharshi. He said, "You can never tell when Bhagavan will come out of  
samadhi. When he does, I am sure he will be pleased to see you."   
I moved near Bhagavan, sitting at his feet and facing him. Not long after this  
Bhagavan opened his eyes. He moved his head and looked directly down at me,  
his eyes looking into mine. It would be impossible to describe that moment and  
I am not going to attempt it. I can only say that at that time I felt my inner  
being raised to a new level -- as if, suddenly, my state of consciousness was  
lifted to a much higher degree. Perhaps in that split second I was no longer  
my human self but the Self. Then Bhagavan smiled at me. It seemed to me that I  
had never before known what a smile was. I said, "I have come a long way to  
see you."   
There was silence. I had stupidly brought a piece of paper on which I had  
written a number of questions I wanted to ask. I fumbled for it in my pocket,  
but the questions were already answered by merely being in his presence. There  
was no need for questions or answers. Nevertheless, I asked, "Tell me, whom  
shall I follow -- what shall I follow? I have been trying to find this out for  
years." Again there was silence. After a few minutes, which seemed to me a  
long time, he spoke, "You are not telling the truth. You are just using words  
-- just talking. You know perfectly well whom to follow. Why do you need me to  
confirm it?" "You mean I should follow my inner self?" I asked. His response  
was, "I don't know anything about your inner self. You should follow the Self.  
There is nothing or no one else to follow."   
I asked again, "What about religions, teachers, gurus?" He said, "Yes, if they  
can help in the quest for the Self. Can a religion, which teaches you to look  
outside yourself, which promises a heaven and a reward outside yourself, be of  
help to you? It is only by diving deep into the spiritual Heart that one can  
find the Self." He placed his right hand on his right breast and continued,  
"Here lies the Heart, the dynamic, spiritual Heart. It is called hridaya and  
is located on the right side of the chest and is clearly visible to the inner  
eye of an adept on the spiritual path. Through meditation you can learn to  
find the Self in the cave of this Heart."   
I said, "Bhagavan, you say that I am to take up the search for the Self by  
atma vichara, asking myself the question 'Who Am I?' May I ask who are you?"  
Bhagavan answered, "When you know the Self, the 'I', 'You', 'He', and 'She'  
disappear. They merge together in pure Consciousness."   
To write about my experience with Bhagavan, to recapture and record all that  
he said, or all that his silences implied is trying to put the infinite into  
an egg cup. On me he had, and still has, a profound influence. I feel it  
presumptuous to say he changed my life. My life was perhaps not so important  
as all that. But I definitely saw life differently after I had been in his  
presence, a presence that just by merely 'being' was sufficient spiritual  
nourishment for a lifetime.**

**" Awaken, be free, be yourself. You are the joy of the world. The light that  
shines in darkness. You are a blessing to the universe. Love yourself always.  
When you love yourself, you love God. Forget about the past. Never dwell on  
the past. Remember, time and space does not exist. If time and space does not  
exist, then there cannot be a past or a future. For the past and the future is  
about space and time. And if there is no time and space, there cannot possibly  
be a past or a future. So who thinks about the past? Who thinks about the  
future? Even to say the 'I' does, the I-thought does, this again is mostly for  
beginners. Self-inquiry is very important, don't get me wrong. But the day has  
to come when you go beyond Self-inquiry. When you just realize and understand  
that there is no I-thought at all. It never existed. Therefore you do not have  
to get rid of it. There is nothing to get rid of, because nothing exists. You  
are total freedom, right this instant, right this minute."   
Sri Robert Adams   
Dear Devotees,   
Self-inquiry is very important because it is the Self-inquiry the earnest and  
sincere practice of which reveals beyond an iota of doubt that the ego-mind-  
body complex is illusory and non-existent and what exists is the Self alone.  
It is then only that one understands that indeed everything, everything is an  
emanation of our own mind. Then only one can absorb the Teaching that it is  
folly to try to improve ourselves and situations in the world because  
everything is preordained, and the only freedom we have is not to react to  
persons and situations, go within and realize the Self. This, Sri Bhagwan has  
enjoined, is the only freedom we have. This strong conviction is obtained  
through Inquiry. And once the falsity of the ego mind begins to dawn, it  
becomes easy to just be, to be still, because then there is no need to  
understand as to how to just be. There is no longer any need to understand it  
intellectually, to analyse it, to ponder over it. One knows within, with  
perfect clarity, what it means to just be, or be still.   
When there is no time, no space, no past, no future, then what it is that  
remains? It is "I AM, NOW".

## Re:[5492] Self-enquiry as taught by Sri Bhagwan is enough  
Author: eranilkumarsinha    Date: October 20, 2018, 10:02:18 AM

**Dear devotees, what follows is wonderful delineation of Sri Bhagwan 's Path  
of the Self-enquiry or the Atma-vichara by His Self-realized, Direct Disciple,  
Sri Robert Adams. Recently I read the book 'Silence of the Heart' and was  
deeply moved to see the beauty and profundity with which he has dealt with the  
Path which came direct from the state of his Realization, but nevertheless, is  
same as Sri Bhagwan's Teaching. Please go through it, for it has the power to  
snap the mind's resistance to awakening and enable to go all the way till the  
very end.   
Sri Robert Adams:  To do affirmations, mantras, yoga exercises and so forth, will not awaken  
you. You start from the beginning. You simply admit to yourself that you  
exist. This is the truth. You do exist, don't you? So you say to yourself, "I  
exist. I know that for sure. I exist. I exist. That's all I know. I'm ignorant  
of everything else, but I do know that I exist, because here I am." And, as  
you keep saying this to yourself, "I exist," you begin to put more space  
between the "I" and "exist." "I...exist."   
If you're doing this correctly, you'll soon find that "I" and "exist" are two  
separate words. In other words, you'll come to the conclusion that you exist  
as I. You'll have to ask yourself, ponder, "Who is this I that exists? What is  
I?" You never answer. It will come to you of its own accord. When you sleep  
and you awaken, you say, "I slept." When you dream you say, "I had a dream."  
And when you're awake, of course, you say, "I am awake." But that I is always  
there. You start to inquire within yourself, "What is this 'I' that exists at  
all times? It exists when I'm asleep, when I'm awake, when I dream. Who is  
this 'I'?" And now the inquiry starts. "Where does this 'I' come from? From  
whence cometh the 'I'?" You ask yourself. The answers are within yourself. And  
you keep asking yourself, over, and over, and over, and over again, "From  
whence cometh the 'I'? Where does the 'I' come from?" Or, again, "From whence  
cometh the 'I'? Where does the 'I' come from?" Or, "Who am I?" And you wait a  
little while, and you repeat the same question, "Where does the 'I' come  
from?"   
While you're doing that, you follow the "I" deep, deep, within. You keep  
following the "I." You go deeper and deeper into the "I." Where does this 'I'  
come from? Who is this 'I'? Whatever answer comes to you is the wrong answer.  
Do not accept it, but do not deny it. You simply put it aside. And you  
continue with the Self-inquiry. "Who am I?" And you wait. And you ask again,  
"Who am I?" It is not a mantra. "Where did the 'I' come from? How did it get  
there? Who gave it birth? What is the source of the T?" You continue to abide  
in the "I."   
As you continue this process, someday something will happen. To some people it  
comes like an explosion within where all your thoughts are wiped away. For you  
see, "I" is the first pronoun, and every thought that you have in the world,  
is attached to the "I." It is secondary. Think about that. Whatever you have  
to say about yourself has "I" in it. Everything in the world is about  
yourself. "I" am going to the movies. "I" am going bowling. "I" feel like  
crying. "I" feel terrible. "I" feel wonderful. "I" feel sick. "I" feel well.  
There's always an "I," "I," "I." What is this "I," and what is it all about?  
Everything is attached to the "I." Subsequently, when the "I" is wiped out,  
everything else is wiped out, and the troubles are over. All thoughts go with  
the "I."   
Now, there's no answer to "Who am I?" When you get to the answer there will be  
emptiness, a void. You will be of the unborn. But it is not a void like you  
think. It is not emptiness like you think. For want of a better word you can  
call it Godliness, Nirvana, Sat-Chit-Ananda, Bliss Consciousness, Absolute  
Reality. It doesn't matter what name you give it. You will become That, and  
there will be no explanation. You will just become That, and you will feel a  
profound peace that you have never felt before. You will feel a bliss that is  
unqualified. You will try to explain it to yourself and to your friends, but  
you cannot. For the finite cannot comprehend the Infinite. There are no words.   
That's the method you use. Self-inquiry. You follow the 'I' \- thought to its  
source. How long does it take? It depends on yourself, how sincere you are,  
what else you're doing with your life. If you're using this like you do  
everything else?for instance if you say, Well today I'm going to practice the  
I-thought, then I'm going to go to a movie, then I'm going to go bowling, then  
I'm going to watch TV, then tomorrow I'll do the same thing," of course,  
what's going to happen in a case like that? Very little. But if you put your  
energy into it, and you practice it every chance you get, and you put this  
first in your life, you will see amazing results. Amazing results. But you  
have to put it first in your life.   
Pranam,   
 Anil**

**Bhagwan Sri Ramana Maharshi: Effortless and choice-less awareness is our real nature. If we can attain that  
state and abide, that is all right. But one cannot reach it without effort,  
the effort of deliberation or meditation, whether it be upon Self inquiry,  
surrender or both. All the age-old vasanas (inherent tendencies) turn the mind  
outward to external objects. All such thoughts must be given up, the mind  
turned inwards. That, for most people, requires effort. Every teacher and  
every scripture tells the aspirant to keep quiet, but it is not so easy to do.   
That is why all this effort is necessary. Even if we find somebody who has  
achieved this supreme state of stillness without seeming effort, you may take  
it that the necessary effort had already been made in a previous life. So  
effortless and choice-less awareness is attained only after deliberate  
meditation. That meditation can take whatever form that most appeals to you.  
See what helps you to be free of thought and adopt that for your meditation.   
Bliss will ensue if you keep still, but however much you tell your mind this  
truth, it will not keep still. It is the ego-mind that tells itself to be  
still in order for it to attain bliss, but it will not do it. Though all the  
scriptures have said it and though we hear it daily from the great ones and  
even from our Guru, we are never quiet, always straying into the world of Maya  
(illusion) and sense objects. That is why conscious, deliberate effort is  
needed to attain that effortless state of stillness.   
Indeed, until the supreme, effortless state is attained, it is impossible for  
a man not to make effort. His own nature compels him to, just as Sri Krishna  
in the Bhagavad Gita told Arjuna that his own nature would compel him to  
fight.   
If you can keep still without engaging in any other pursuits, well and good.  
But for so long as you are obliged to be active, do not give up the attempt to  
realize the Self. Often glimpses of Realization are attained before it becomes  
permanent, and in all such cases effort remains necessary.   
Yet, the belief that you have to make an effort to get rid of this dream of a  
waking state and attain Realization or real awakening is also a part of the  
dream. When you attain Realization you will see that there was neither the  
dream during sleep nor the dream during the waking state, but only yourself  
and your real nature.

**Sri V. Ganesan: N. R. Krishnamurthy Iyer was a brilliant professor of physics. He had studied  
under Dr. C. V. Raman, the Nobel laureate of international repute. Known as  
NRK, he would pick a fight with anyone who ignoring the practicalities of life  
focused only on God and the spiritual side. He had to have a scientific  
explanation for anything before accepting it. Though a Hindu, he felt that not  
only was it superstition to prostrate before anyone, it was also degrading  
oneself. In 1922, NRK came to Tiruvannamalai to meet his sister who stayed  
there. NRK's brother-in-law Kuppuswamy and his friend T. K. Sunderesa Iyer,  
who were just leaving to see Bhagavan, told him, "We are both going to Ramana  
Maharshi. Krishnamurthy, you also come along with us." NRK agreed but on the  
condition, "Do not expect me to prostrate before the one whom you call the  
Maharshi." The friends smiled - they knew beyond doubt what was in store.   
At that time, Ramanasramam was just a thatched shed built over the Mother's  
samadhi. The three entered the thatched shed and then something strange  
happened. Without even being aware of it, the professor found himself flat on  
the ground, prostrating before the Maharshi. The two friends smiled broadly  
when they witnessed this, because this was exactly what they had anticipated.  
For, there is no need to persuade a skeptic to do something; spiritual power  
itself is potent enough. Bhagavan was totally focusing on NRK. After a few  
minutes, NRK got up, taken aback by what he had done. He then decided to have  
a debate with Bhagavan so that he could make amends for his spontaneous act.   
NRK narrated to me what happened next: "I asked Bhagavan, 'Seated like this,  
what is your next state?' My idea was to elicit the reply that the soul  
survives the dissolution of the body and later gets united with the Self or  
God. I wanted to have a verbal war with him in order to disprove him. But, it  
was not to be. Several minutes passed after I raised my question. There was no  
reply. There was absolute silence as our eyes interlocked in a steady gaze. A  
thought arose within me: 'Is this man taking shelter in silence to avoid  
answering an inconvenient question?' At that very moment, Bhagavan's  
resounding voice rang out, 'You said 'sthiti' (state); what do you mean by  
'sthiti'?' This sudden counter question made me feel that I had to answer him.  
So, I began to think. I did not ask him about the body that will be buried or  
burned; what I was thinking about was the thinking apparatus inside the body  
called the mind. It is about this that I had asked. Now, if I said that the  
question was about the state of the mind then he would ask me to define the  
mind. I had to have a ready answer to this question. Therefore, within myself,  
I raised the enquiry, and this of course was because of the power of his look.  
I could, however, find no answer to the question. My mind was paralyzed; the  
thinking power was dead. I became helplessly mute. I noticed the fierce glow  
in Bhagavan's eyes. They locked mine in a tight grip. Then, a radiant smile of  
triumph spread over the Maharshi's face. I lost all awareness of both the body  
and the world as the insignificant 'I' in me was swallowed up in the pure  
awareness of being, in which all names, forms, time and action were utterly  
lost. It was a state of immense silence, without a beginning or an end, but  
aglow with the self-effulgent 'I AM'. When I recovered consciousness of my  
body and its surroundings, with the inner glow still effulgent, there were no  
more questions to be asked or answered. Revelling in the joy of that defeat, I  
quickly prostrated and ran out."   
""That was the beginning of the end of the 'me'. After having given the  
experience of spiritual explosion within myself, Bhagavan invited me. He said,  
'Come in and have lunch.' It was just a thatched shed, so everything -  
darshan, food, and sleep - took place there."

**" Live in the moment. Can you be unhappy in the moment? The only reason,  
again, you're unhappy is because you're thinking of some condition or  
situation you don't like. True. You're thinking about something from the past  
or you're worried about something that's going to happen in the future. That's  
the only reason you're sad or unhappy. But if you learn to live in the moment,  
if you learn to become aware now, how can you possibly be unhappy? Because now  
is Bliss. Just don't think. Experience now. If you're really not thinking and  
you're experiencing now, you're in Bliss. Now is Reality. Now is ultimate

**Bhagwan Sri Ramana: The 'I' of the dream soon vanishes, then another 'I' speaks of the dream. This  
'I' was not in the dream. Both the ?I?s are unreal. There is the substratum of  
the mind which continues all along, giving rise to so many scenes. An 'I'  
rises forth with every thought and with its disappearance that 'I' disappears  
too. Many 'I's are born and die every moment. The subsisting mind is the real  
trouble. That is the thief according to Janaka. Find him out and you will be  
happy.   
Talk No. 49   
Dear devotees,   
If an 'I' rises with every thought and it disappears with the disappearance of  
the risen thought, and in this way many 'I's are born and die every moment,  
what assailed me till recently was the question of continuity of the sense of  
the self, i.e., the 'I', that we find the same everyday on waking. However, I  
kept enquiring and thus working on myself and then all of a sudden it dawned  
that indeed with every thought and experience, a thinker or an experiencer  
rises and it is memory alone that creates the illusion of continuity. Thus,  
myriad thinkers and experiencers rise and appear in the Self, in 'I Am', each  
though separate in memory but identical in essence. And the sense of identity,  
continuity and the sense of self are on account of the common substratum of  
the mind--common factor 'I Am'\--which is the essence and is at the root of  
all thinker-thought or the experiencer-experience relationships. This timeless  
and spaceless Essence alone make all the experiences whatsoever possible.   
If we remain alert and attentive, we can certainly discern and recognize when  
the ego-I or the 'I'-thought rises. With recognition it becomes clearer and  
clearer for scrutiny. And remember that the consciousness that recognizes its  
emergence is the witnessing consciousness. Therefore, we must attain that  
state when we are able to recognize every time an 'I' rises, for every time we  
recognize its emergence it is further weakened, till it finally disappears in  
the Substratum, that is, the Self.   
Pranam,

Yes,this is why i have posted this part of Sri Sadhu Om's book. It is much  
better to do such fresh attempts because the strain is avoided in this way,and  
whenever strain is there we are not doing it properly. To do selfenquiry in a  
relaxed manner is very important.First, because the very practice is more  
fruitful,since this 'I' tends to disappear,so to say,second,the health and  
general well being of the body is preserved. Sure,to body should not be given  
too much importance,but at the same time it should not be neglected before we  
are ripe to neglect it. I am not sure if this can be understood when written  
in this way,but what i am trying to say that general balance is needed in all  
our endeavors.   
In selfenquiry itself there is no danger like with some other practices,this  
is my experience. But often,and mostly when there is strain we are out of  
selfenquiry,and usually in majority of cases it is mixed up with other aids.  
But,true motive behind it is the most important thing of all,and the very  
readiness to do it will show us the right way and where we are making mistake.  
Like Maharaj loved to say- earnestness is all what matters.   
Thank You my dear friend for all beautiful writings!   
With love,

## Re:[5498] Self-enquiry as taught by Sri Bhagwan is enough  
Author: eranilkumarsinha    Date: **Today** at 10:01:09 AM

**An excerpt from Sri Michael James ' book 'The Art of Being': If we wish to estimate the value of something in a particular currency, we  
must first know the value of a single unit of that currency. Without knowing  
the value of the unit 'one', we cannot know the value of any other number.  
Similarly, we cannot know the truth of the past or the future if we do not  
know the truth of the present, because the present moment is the one basic  
unit of time--the sole substance of which all time is formed.   
Just as the present moment, 'now', is the central point in the conceptual  
dimension of time, so the present place, 'here', is the central point in the  
conceptual dimension of space. Every point in space that we perceive or think  
of exists only with reference to this present place, the point in space at  
which we now feel ourself to be.   
What determines which point in space and which point in time are experienced  
as being present? What we experience as the present place, 'here', and the  
present moment, 'now', is that point in space and time in which we feel  
ourself to be present. The presence of our consciousness of being, 'I am', is  
therefore what makes us feel that this place in space is present 'here', and  
that this point in time is present ?now?.   
All definitions of time and place are relative to this fundamental time 'now'  
and this fundamental place 'here'. The past is the past because it is prior to  
this present moment, which we call 'now', and the future is the future because  
it is subsequent to this present moment. Similarly, all definitions of place  
such as 'near' or 'far', 'there' or 'elsewhere', are relative only to this  
present place, which we call 'here'. Therefore, since the definition of 'now'  
and 'here' is that these are the points in time and space in which we always  
experience ourself to be, all time and space ultimately exists only with  
reference to our essential, fundamental and ever-present consciousness of our  
own being, 'I am'.   
Because we feel this particular body to be ourself, we feel that the point in  
space where this body now exists is 'here'. Thus our mind, the limited  
consciousness that feels 'I am this body', always feels itself to be here and  
now, in the present place and present moment. Since this limited consciousness  
'I am this body', which is the knowing subject or first person, is always  
experienced as the central point in space, it is not only the 'first person'  
but also the 'first place'. That is, the first or fundamental place, the  
central point in space, which we call 'here', is only our own mind, the  
consciousness that we always feel to be the first person, 'I'. Every other  
place or point in space exists only with reference to this fundamental place,  
the ever-present first person.   
Because we identify ourself with a particular body, we feel that we move about  
in space, whereas in fact space moves about in us. That is, because we are not  
this material body but only consciousness, all space exists only within us,  
and hence all movement in space occurs only within us. Wherever we appear to  
go, the present place 'here' goes with us. When we seem to move from one place  
to another, that other place becomes 'here', that is, it moves into and  
becomes the central place in our consciousness.   
Thus, just as the present moment, 'now', is the static and unchanging moment  
through which all moments in time pass, so the present place, 'here', is the  
static and unchanging place through which, near which or far from which all  
places in space move. Therefore, just as the present moment is the static  
gateway through which we may pass from the illusion of experiencing ever-  
changing time to the reality of our ever-unchanging being, so the present  
place is the static gateway through which we may pass from the illusion of  
being a body that moves about in space to the reality of our ever-unmoving  
being.

Dear Sri Jewell, yes, loving the Self and practicing the Self-enquiry is a  
gentle and persuasive Way, and therefore, it entails no risks and danger. But  
doing it forcefully such that it causes strain is certainly not the right way  
to go about the Enquiry. Moreover, it is obvious that when it started to cause  
strain, it means that one is out of Enquiry, as you said, because then the  
mind can no longer abide in the 'I Am' which is always in the NOW, because it  
will move away from the "I Am, Now".   
Yes, Self-enquiry is its own guide and the course-correction in case one makes  
a mistake is ingrained in it.   
Dear friend, Sri Jewell, I recently read the Book 'I Am That' and found Sri  
Maharaj's Teaching almost exactly same as Sri Bhagwan's. Thank you.   
Sri Maharaj: Only in the dissolution of the problem in the universal solvents  
of enquiry and dispassion, can its right solution be found.   
Pranam,

**Dear Devotees,   
The Holy Hill Sri Arunachala is identified with the spiritual Heart of  
creation of God, and is regarded as the Original Maha Lingam and Mool  
Jyotirlingam. The Holy Hill is also regarded as the Ardhnarishwar because the  
Goddess Mother Parvati is said to have united with Him here in Sri Arunachala.  
The Hill appeared to the Gods, Brahma and Vishnu as a great, blazing column of  
Fire. They wondered what it could be and started in competition with each  
other to find out its Source. Brahma flew up as a swan and Vishnu started to  
burrow down in the form of a boar. But the search was endless. Vishnu came up  
again admitting his defeat. On his way Brahma caught a flower that was falling  
and taking it down to Vishnu pretended that he had reached the top and had  
there picked this flower. Suddenly Lord Siva, who had taken the form of the  
column of fire, appeared to them. He condemned Brahma for his deceit and said  
that as a punishment he should have no temple dedicated to his honour. As a  
reward for his honesty Vishnu was told that he should receive universal  
worship.   
 Dear devotees, striving to reach the end of the column of Fire signifies the  
search in the Heart for the realization of the Self and all the difficulties  
that entailed.   
 Bhagavan Sri Ramana said in explanation that the 'I'-sense was Vishnu and  
the intellect Brahma, they both turned outward and that is where they erred.   
The Significance of the Beacon   
Sri Bhagavan Ramana has sung extolling the greatness of Sri Arunachala and  
the Beacon of Light of Sri Arunachala thus: To make the intellect rid of the sense   
'I am the body', and to introspect   
By fixing it securely in the Heart,   
And so perceive the true light of the SELF,   
The one 'I-I', which is the ABSOLUTE,   
This the significance of witnessing   
The Beacon Light of Arunachala,   
The centre of the earth.   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana has declared Sri Arunachala as the spiritual Centre and the  
Self of all existence whatsoever.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

**Bhagwan Sri Ramana: "It is possible to perform all the activities of life with detachment and  
regard only the Self as real. It is wrong to suppose that if one is fixed in  
the Self one?s duties in life will not be properly performed. It is like an  
actor. He dresses and acts and even feels the part he is playing, but he knows  
really that he is not that character but someone else in real life. In the  
same way, why should the body-consciousness or the feeling 'I-am-the-body'  
disturb you   
once you know for certain that you are not the body but the Self? Nothing that  
the body does should shake you from abidance in the Self. Such abidance will  
never interfere with the proper and effective discharge of whatever duties the  
body has, any more than the actor's   
being aware of his real status in life interferes with his acting a part on  
the stage."   
Dear devotees,   
Sri Bhagwan has explained on numerous occasions that it is not the work done  
that is an impediment to the spiritual practice (Sadhana) but only the  
attitude of mind in which the work is done. It is quite possible to continue  
one's normal chores and vocation without attachment. He has taught that the  
feeling 'I work' alone is the obstacle.   
Bhawan Sri Ramana:  "The feeling 'I work' is the obstacle, ask yourself who works. Remember who  
you are. Then the work will not bind you. It will go on automatically."   
Dear devotees, Sri Arthur Osborne who moved with Sri Bhagwan closely and  
intimately has observed thus: "Many were puzzled at first by the injunction to work with detachment and  
wondered whether their work really could be carried on efficiently in such a  
way. And yet they had before them the example of Sri Bhagavan himself, for  
whatever he did was meticulously accurate, whether correcting proofs or  
binding a book, whether preparing food or cutting and polishing a coconut-  
shell spoon. And in fact, even before the I-am-the-doer illusion has been  
dissipated, an aloof attitude to work does not impair but enhance efficiency,  
so long as it is combined with conscientiousness, for it does not imply  
indifference to the quality of the work done but only non-intrusion of ego  
into it; and it is the intrusion of ego that causes both friction and  
inefficiency. If all people were to perform their work simply because it is  
their work, without vanity or self-interest, exploitation would cease, effort  
would be rightly directed, co-ordination would replace rivalry, and most of  
the world?s problems would be solved. That the efficiency of the work done  
would not suffer is apparent if one remembers that the ages of faith in every  
religion have produced the most exquisite art, whether in Gothic, cathedral or  
in mosque, whether Hindu sculpture or Taoist painting, by artists who regarded  
themselves as instruments and preferred to remain anonymous. Examples can be  
drawn from other professions also. A doctor works more efficiently when he is  
unemotional and indeed, for this reason, often prefers not to treat his own  
family. A financier works more coolly and efficiently where his own interests  
are not at stake. Even in games, fortune favours one who is unconcerned."   
Anil

**This afternoon, a visitor asked Bhagavan, "No doubt the method taught by  
Bhagavan is direct. But it is so difficult. We do not know how to begin it. If  
we go on asking, 'Who am I?' 'Who am I?' like a japa, with 'Who am I?' for  
mantra, it becomes dull. In other methods, there is something preliminary and  
positive with which one can begin and then go step by step. But in Bhagavan's  
method, there is no such thing, and to seek the Self at once, though direct,  
is difficult."   
Bhagavan Sri Ramana: You yourself concede, it is the direct method. It is the  
direct and easy method. When going after other things, alien to us, is so  
easy, how can it be difficult for one to go to one's own Self? You talk of  
'Where to begin'. There is no beginning and no end. You are yourself the  
beginning and the end. If you are here and the Self somewhere else, and you  
have to reach that Self, you may be told how to start, how to travel and then  
how to reach. Suppose you who are now in Ramana Asramam ask, 'I want to go to  
Ramana Asramam. How shall I start and how to reach it?', what is one to say? A  
man's search for the Self is like that. He is always the Self and nothing  
else. You say 'Who am I?' becomes a japa. It is not meant that you should go  
on asking ?Who am I?? In that case, thought will not so easily die. All japas  
are intended, by the use of one thought, the mantra, to exclude all other  
thoughts. This, japa eventually does for a man. All other thoughts, except the  
thought of the mantra, gradually die and then even that one thought dies. Our  
Self is of the nature of japa. Japa is always going on there. If we give up  
all thoughts, we shall find japa is always there without any effort on our  
part. In the direct method, as you call it, by saying ask yourself 'Who am I?'  
you are told to concentrate within yourself where the I-thought (the root of  
all other thoughts) arises. As the Self is not outside but inside you, you are  
asked to dive within, instead of going without, and what can be more easy than  
going to yourself? But the fact remains that to some this method will seem  
difficult and will not appeal. That is why so many different methods have been  
taught. Each of them will appeal to some as the best and easiest. That is  
according to their pakva or fitness. But to some, nothing except the vichara  
marga will appeal. They will ask, 'You want me to know or to see this or that.  
But who is the knower, the seer?' Whatever other method may be chosen, there  
will be always a doer. That cannot be escaped. Who is that doer must be found  
out. Till that, the sadhana cannot be ended. So eventually, all must come to  
find out 'Who am I?'. You complain that there is nothing preliminary or  
positive to start with. You have the 'I' to start with. You know you exist  
always, whereas the body does not exist always, e.g., in sleep. Sleep reveals  
that you exist even without a body. We identify the 'I' with a body, we regard  
the Self as having a body, and as having limits, and hence all our trouble.  
All that we have to do is to give up identifying our Self with the body, with  
forms and limits, and then we shall know ourselves as the Self that we always  
are.   
Source: Day by Day With Bhagavan   
Dear Devotees,   
Whatever the spiritual practice, it must culminate in the disappearance of the  
'I'-thought or the knower or the seer or the doer. Only then the sadhana or  
the practice can be ended. And this disappearance of that which does not exist  
results in the shining forth of the effulgent Self of Its own accord because  
identification with the illusory name and form alone is the obstacle to the  
Self-Realization. Therefore, indeed, eventually finding the answer to the  
existential question 'Who am I?' alone is the attainment of the Goal  
irrespective of the methods chosen.   
Whether one accepts it or not, 'Who Am I?' enquiry is the only spiritual  
practice in which a devotee or a seeker has not only something preliminary but  
he has his own permanent and self-evident experience 'I exist' to start with,   
for can anything be more positive and more self-evident (pratyaksha) than 'I  
am'?   
Pranam,   
 Anil

**Sri V. Ganesan: YOU ARE THE LIGHT   
If we close our eyes and turn our attention outwards, there is darkness. Any  
effort to turn outwards is the mind's doing. But if our attention is turned  
inwards, there is light. This inward look with closed eyes is a spiritual  
exercise that is not dictated by the mind. As such, the mind can neither  
register it nor know it. That is the reason why many do not notice this  
natural, yet immense spiritual phenomenon, which is available to all of us at  
all times.   
The Vedas, the Hindu sacred scriptures, adore the Self within each one of us,  
as more brilliant than millions of suns.Sages confirm and affirm this truth.  
Man's mind refuses to believe it, for it is not graspable by its tongs-the  
intellect, and the sensations received through the five senses. Sat sangh  
helps us to ignore our mind and its dictates. It helps us to turn eagerly to  
the scriptures and their living symbols, the sages and saints, for light on  
wisdom.   
Bhagavan Sri Ramana, the greatest sage who lived in our midst till very  
recently, conforming to the scriptures, says, "Pure light is consciousness.  
The subject, the cognizer, functions both as light and objects seen. If the  
light, i.e., the subject or consciousness is beheld, then, no objects will be  
seen. Pure light alone will remain."   
This light is not a mystery. It is always there within all of us. Bhagavan  
constantly advised us to turn our attention on this light within, by saying,  
"Dive within, plunge within". Jesus Christ said, "Be a light unto yourself".  
You are that light only, the agni of Arunachala, the jnana of Bhagavan. When  
we close our eyes and look within, there is a glow that comes neither from  
outside nor from inside. It is the brilliance of the light of the Self.   
Since we are not accustomed to it, initially, it will look dim and dull. On  
prolonged attention to it, the light will glow, and most naturally. This is  
not a miracle! Practice though, is essential to focus our attention inwards  
and BE the light. Do not imagine a light. Also, do not ignore seeing the  
light, assuming it to be one's imagination. We have to be very attentive and  
inwardly very alert to imbibe this happening. This is a spiritual experience  
beyond the limits and borders of the intellect and the mind. Though this  
happening takes place through the mind and intellect, it definitely does not  
happen because of or by any one of them. This light, unlike a flame, has no  
form. Just be aware of the luminosity pervading your being. You are the Light.   
Dear devotees, we are the Awareness, Pure Consciousness, and that is the only  
Light or the Life. Indeed, we are the pictures made of the Light. Are we not?  
But, due to error of perception, we imagine this insentient body to be  
ourselves. Hence, out of great compassion and solicitude for His devotees,  
then and now, whoever turned to Him, Bhagwan Sri Ramana constantly exhorted  
them to dive within and guided them to turn their attention on this Light that  
they really always are, and realize their true nature as Awareness.   
Pranam,   
 Anil

Dear Sri Atmavichar, yes, you have said it so beautifully! To eat the cake,  
and have it too! Ego-mind wants to show even the Self-realization as a trophy,  
as its prized and much sought-after attainment. And this is perhaps one reason  
why many devotees get stuck in their sadhana and are not able to go deeper and  
see the Light, as it were. Ego must surrender or disappear for the Self to  
shine forth.   
Thanks very much.   
Pranam,

**Bhagwan Sri Ramana: To introvert the mind is the prime thing. The  
Buddhists consider the flow of 'I- thought to be Liberation; whereas we say  
that such flow proceeds from its underlying substratum - the only - Reality.   
Why should one be meditating 'I am Brahman?' Only the annihilation of 'I' is  
Liberation. But it can be gained only by keeping the 'I-I' always in view. So  
the need for the investigation of the 'I'-thought. If the 'I' is not let go,  
no blank can result to the seeker. Otherwise meditation will end in sleep.   
There is only one 'I' all along, but what arises up from time to time is the  
mistaken 'I'-thought; whereas the intuitive 'I' always remains Self-shining,  
i.e., even before it becomes manifest.

**Bhagwan Sri Ramana: What is body-consciousness? Tell us that first. Who are  
you apart from consciousness? Body is found because there is body-  
consciousness which arises from 'I-consciousness' which again rises from  
consciousness.   
Consciousness -> 'I-consciousness' -> body-consciousness ->body.   
There is always consciousness and nothing but that. What you are now  
considering to be body-consciousness is due to superimposition. If there is  
only consciousness and nothing but it, the meaning of the Scripture Atmanastu  
kamaya sarvam priyam bhavati - (All are dear because of the love of the Self)  
becomes clear.**

**In answer to a visitor Bhagavan made the following remarks: Bhagwan Sri Ramana: "You can have, or rather you will yourself be, the highest  
imaginable kind of happiness. All other kinds of happiness which you have  
spoken of as 'pleasure', 'joy', 'happiness', 'bliss' are only reflections of  
the ananda which, in your true nature, you are."   
"You need not bother about the lights which you say you see around things and  
people. Whether lights are seen or sounds are heard or whatever may happen,  
never let go the enquiry 'Who am I?' Keep on asking inwardly: 'Who sees these  
lights or hears these sounds?'"   
"What do you mean by taking sannyasa? Do you think it means leaving your home  
or wearing robes of a certain colour? Wherever you go, even if you fly up into  
the air, will your mind not go with you? Or can you leave it behind you and go  
without it?"

Devotee: Can we not see the glory as million-sun-splendour?

Devotee: It must be possible to do so by divine sight. ?Where the sun shines  
not, etc. That is My Supreme abode?. Therefore there is a state where this sun  
is powerless. That state is that of God.

**Bhagwan Sri Ramana: All these are however on the assumption that the jiva  
(individual self) is separate from the Self or Brahman. But are we separate?  
'No', says the Jnani. The ego is simply wrong identity of the Self with the  
non-self, as in the case of a colourless crystal and its coloured background.  
The crystal though colourless appears red because of its background. If the  
background is removed the crystal shines in its original purity. So it is with  
the Self and the antahkaranas (inner organs).   
Still again the illustration is not quite appropriate. For the ego has its  
source from the Self and is not separate like the background from the crystal.  
Having its source from the Self, the ego must only be retraced in order that  
it might merge in its source. The centre of the ego and its core is called the  
Heart, the same as the Self.

**Question: What is the nature of the Self?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: What exists in truth is the Self alone. The world, the  
individual soul and God are appearances in it. Like silver in mother-of-pearl,  
these three appear at the same time and disappear at the same time. The Self  
is that where there is absolutely no 'I-thought'. That is called 'Silence'.  
The Self itself is the world; the Self itself is 'I'; the Self itself is God;  
all is Siva, the Self.   
Who Am I?   
...   
Question: What is the sign of wisdom (viveka)?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Its beauty lies in remaining free from delusion after  
realising the truth once. There is fear only for one who sees even a slight  
difference in the Supreme Brahman. So long as there is the idea that the body  
is the Self one cannot be a realizer of truth whoever he might be.

**K.M. Jivrajani: I sometimes concentrate on the brain centre and sometimes on  
the heart--not always on the same centre. Is that wrong?   
Bhagavan Sri Ramana: Wherever you concentrate and on whatever centre there  
must be a you to concentrate, and that is what you must concentrate on.  
Different people concentrate on different centres, not only the brain and the  
heart but also the space between the eyebrows, the tip of the nose, the tip of  
the tongue, the lowermost chakra and even external objects. Such concentration  
may lead to a sort of laya in which you will feel a certain bliss, but care  
must be taken not to lose the thought 'I Am' in all this. You never cease to  
exist in all these experiences.   
K.M. Jivrajani: That is to say that I must be a witness?   
Bhagavan Sri Ramana: Talking of the 'witness' should not lead to the idea that  
there is a witness and something else apart from him that he is witnessing.  
The 'witness' really means the light that illumines the seer, the seen and the  
process of seeing. Before, during and after the triads of seer, seen and  
seeing, the illumination exists. It alone exists always.

**Question: It is cruel of God 's leela (play) to make the knowledge of the  
Self so hard.   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana Maharshi: Knowing the Self is being the Self, and being  
means existence, one's own existence. No one denies one's existence any more  
than one denies one's eyes, although one cannot see them. The trouble lies  
with your desire to objectify the Self, in the same way as you objectify your  
eyes when you place a mirror before them. You have been so accustomed to  
objectivity that you have lost the knowledge of yourself, simply because the  
Self cannot be objectified. Who is to know the Self ? Can the insentient body  
know it? All the time you speak and think of your `I', yet when questioned you  
deny knowledge of it. You are the Self, yet you ask how to know the Self.  
Where then is God's leela (play) and where is its cruelty? Because of this  
denial of the Self by people the sastras (scriptures) speak of maya, leela,  
etc.

**Devotee: Bhagavan always speaks from the highest standpoint.   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: (with a smile): People would not understand the simple and  
bare truth - the truth of their every day, ever-present and eternal  
experience. That Truth is that of the Self. Is there anyone not aware of the  
Self? They would not even like to hear it (the Self), whereas they are eager  
to know what lies beyond - heaven, hell, reincarnation. Because they love  
mystery and not the bare truth, religions pamper them - only to bring them  
round to the Self. Wandering hither and thither you must return to the Self  
only. Then, why not abide in the Self even here and now?   
The other worlds require the Self as a spectator or speculator. Their reality  
is only of the same degrees as that of the spectator or thinker. They cannot  
exist without the spectator, etc. Therefore they are not different from the  
Self. Even the ignorant man sees only the Self when he sees objects. But he is  
confused and identifies the Self with the object, i.e., the body and with the  
senses and plays in the world. Subject and object - all merge in the Self.  
There is no seer nor objects seen. The seer and the seen are the Self. There  
are not many selves either. All are only one Self.

**Bhagwan Sri Ramana: "All thoughts are inconsistent with Realization. The  
right thing to do is to exclude thoughts of oneself and all other thoughts.  
Thought is one thing and Realization is quite another."   
Sri Arthur Osborne: There is no answer to the Who-am-I question. There can be  
no answer, for it is dissolving the I-thought, which is the parent of all  
other thoughts, and piercing beyond to the stillness where thought is not.   
Sri Bhagwan: "Suggestive replies to the enquiry, such as Sivoham (I am Siva)  
are not to be given to the mind during meditation. The true answer will come  
of itself. No answer the ego can give can be right."   
Sri Osborne: The answer is the awakening current of awareness mentioned at the  
end of Chapter One, vibrating as the very essence of one's being and yet  
impersonal. By constant practice this is to be made more and more frequent  
until it becomes continuous, not only during mediation but underlying speech  
and action also. Even then the vichara is still to be used, for the ego will  
try to make a truce with the current of awareness and if it is once tolerated  
it will gradually grow to power and then fight to recover supremacy, like the  
Gentiles whom the Hebrews allowed to remain in the Promised Land. Sri Bhagavan  
insisted (for instance, in his replies to Sivaprakasam Pillai) that the  
enquiry is to be kept up to the very end. Whatever states, whatever powers,  
whatever perceptions or visions may come, there is always the question of to  
whom they come until the Self alone remains.

**Sri Arthur Osborne: The teaching of Sri Bhagavan was intensely practical. He expounded theory only  
in answer to the specific needs and questions of devotees and as a necessary  
basis for practice. When reminded once (in Maharshi's Gospel) that the Buddha  
had refused to answer questions about God, He replied with approval:  "In fact the Buddha was more concerned with directing the seeker to realize  
Bliss here and now than with academic discussions about God and so forth."   
So also, He himself would often refuse to gratify curiosity, turning the  
questioner instead to the need for sadhana or effort. Asked about the  
posthumous state of man, He might reply: "Why do you want to know what you will be when you die before you know what  
you are now? First find out what you are now."   
A man is now and eternally the deathless Self behind this and every other  
life, but to be told so or to believe it is not enough; it is necessary to  
strive to realize it. Similarly, if asked about God He might reply: "Why do you want to know about God before you know yourself? First find out  
what you are."

**Bhagwan Sri Ramana Maharshi: He who dedicates his mind to Thee and, seeing Thee, always beholds the  
universe as Thy form, who at all times glorifies Thee and loves Thee as none  
other than the Self, he is the Master without peer, being one with Thee, Oh  
Arunachala! and lost in Thy Bliss.   
Stanza-5, Sri Arunachala Panchratna   
If Self has form, the world and God likewise have form. If Self is without  
form, by whom and how can form (of world and God) be seen? Without the eye,  
can there be sight or spectacle? The Self, the real Eye, is infinite.   
Verse-4, Forty Verses On That Which Is   
Mr. Nanavati of Bombay asked Bhagavan, "In the fifth stanza of Arunachala  
Pancharatna reference is made to seeing ?Your form in everything?. What is the  
form referred to?"   
Bhagavan Sri Ramana said, "The stanza says that one should completely  
surrender one's mind, turn it inwards and see 'you' the Self within and then  
see the Self in 'you' in everything. It is only after seeing the Self within  
that one will be able to see the Self in everything. One must first realise  
there is nothing but the Self and that he is that Self, and then only he can  
see everything as the form of the Self. That is the meaning of saying, 'See  
the Self in everything and everything in the Self', as is stated in the Gita  
and other books. It is the same truth that is taught in stanza 4 of the  
Reality in Forty Verses. If you have the idea that you are something with  
form, that you are limited by this body, and that being within this body you  
have to see through these eyes, God and the world also will appear to you as  
form. If you realise you are without form, that you are unlimited, that you  
alone exist, that you are the eye, the infinite eye, what is there to be seen  
apart from the infinite eye? Apart from the eye, there is nothing to be seen.  
There must be a seer for an object to be seen, and there must be space, time,  
etc. But if the Self alone exists, it is both seer and seen, and above seeing  
or being seen."

**Devotee: So, it is wrong to begin with a goal: is it?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: If there be a goal to be reached it cannot be permanent.  
The goal must already be there. We seek to reach the goal with the ego, but  
the goal exists before the ego. What is in the goal is even prior to our  
birth, i.e., to the birth of the ego. Because we exist the ego appears to  
exist too.   
If we look on the Self as the ego then we become the ego, if as the mind we  
become the mind, if as the body we become the body. It is the thought which  
builds up sheaths in so many ways. The shadow on the water is found to be  
shaking. Can anyone stop the shaking of the shadow? If it should cease to  
shake you would not notice the water but only the light. Similarly to take no  
notice of the ego and its activities, but see only the light behind. The ego  
is the I-thought. The true 'I' is the Self.   
Devotee: It is one step to realisation.   
BHagwan Sri Ramana: Realisation is already there. The state free from thoughts  
is the only real state. There is no such action as Realisation. Is there  
anyone who is not realising the Self? Does anyone deny his own existence?  
Speaking of realisation, it implies two selves - the one to realise, the other  
to be realised. What is not already realised, is sought to be realised. Once  
we admit our existence, how is it that we do not know our Self?

**Bhagwan Sri Ramana: All religions postulate the three fundamentals: the  
world, the soul and God; but it is the One Reality that manifests itself as  
these three. One can say: 'The three are really three? only so long as the ego  
lasts. Therefore to inhere in one?s own Being, when the ego is dead is the  
perfect state.'   
'The world is real', 'No, it is mere illusory appearance', 'The world is  
conscious,' 'No', 'The world is happiness', 'No,' ' What use is it to argue  
thus' That state is agreeable to all wherein, having given up the objective  
outlook, one knows one's Self and loses all notions either of unity or  
duality, of oneself and the ego.   
If one has form oneself, the world and God will also appear to have form; but  
if one is formless, who is to see these forms, and how? Without the eye can  
any object be seen? The seeing Self is the Eye, and that Eye is the Eye of  
Infinity.   
Brahman is not to be seen or known. It is beyond the three fold relationship  
of seer, sight and seen, or knower, knowledge and known. The Reality remains  
ever as it is. The existence of ignorance or the world is due to our illusion.  
Neither knowledge nor ignorance is real; what lies beyond them, as beyond all  
other pairs of opposites, is the Reality. It is neither light nor darkness but  
beyond both, though we sometimes speak of it as light and of ignorance as its  
shadow.

**Devotee: Hitherto I had great fear of Mukti (Liberation). Till now I  
regarded it as horrible. Now I see that it is a very agreeable state. Now as  
regards the powers called Siddhis, are they to be achieved and are they  
opposed to Mukti (Liberation)?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: The highest Siddhi is realisation of the Self, ( Atma-  
Sakshathkara); for, here once you realise the truth you cease to be drawn to  
the path of ignorance.   
Devotee: Then what are the Siddhis.............?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: There are two kinds of Siddhis (powers); one kind may well  
be a stumbling block to realisation. It is said that by mantra, by some drug  
possessing occult powers, by severe austerities or by samadhi of a certain  
kind, powers can be acquired ; but these are not means of Self-knowledge, even  
when you acquire them, you may quite well be in ignorance.   
Devotee: What is the other kind?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: They are manifestations of power and knowledge quite  
natural to you when you realise the Self. They are Siddhis, products of the  
normal and natural Tapas of the man who has reached Self -attainment. They  
come of their own accord, they are God-given; they come according to one's own  
Karma so to say, but whether they come or not, the Siddha of the Real, settled  
in the supreme peace, is not disturbed. For he knows the Self and that is the  
unshakable Siddhi. But these Siddhis do not come by trying for them. When you  
are in the state of realisation, you will know what these powers are.   
Devotee: You have said a Mukta (Liberated One) in the long run, by his natural  
tapas, can become intangible, invisible, can assume any form.. ....   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Yes: it is the Mukta that is most competent for such  
developments. But you cannot judge the Jnanin by these developments, as they  
are not signs of true knowledge, which essentially consists in possessing eye  
of equality (Samatva drishti).

**Bhagwan Sri Ramana: "Every plane has its own illusion, which can be destroyed only by another  
illusion on the same plane. For example, a man takes a full meal and goes to  
sleep. He dreams of being hungry in spite of the jagrat food in his stomach.  
To satisfy the dream hunger, he has to take dream food. A wound in dream  
requires dream treatment. A great king once dreamt that he was ill but was too  
poor to call a doctor. He had to beg the doctors fees from his friends to  
receive medical help. Although he had fabulous wealth in the waking state, it  
could be of no use to him in the dream state. Similarly the illusion of ajnana  
(ignorance) can be destroyed only by the illusion of guru-upadesa (the Masters  
teaching). Mukti (liberation) is ever-present and bondage ever-absent, yet the  
universal experience is the reverse."   
Guru Ramana

**Question: Brahman (the Supreme Reality) is said to be Sat-Chit-Ananda  
(Existence-Consciousness-Bliss). What does that mean?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Yes. That is so. That which is, is only Sat (Existence or  
Being). That is called Brahman. The lustre of Sat is Chit (Consciousness) and  
its nature is Ananda (Bliss). These are not different from Sat (Existence or  
Being). All the three together are known as Sat-Chit-Ananda (Existence-  
Consciousness-Bliss).   
Question: As the Self is Existence (Sat) and Consciousness (Chit) what is the  
reason for describing it as different from the existent and the non-existent,  
the sentient and the insentient?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Although the Self is real, as it comprises everything, it  
does not give room for questions involving duality about its reality or  
unreality. Therefore it is said to be different from the real and the unreal.  
Similarly, even though it is consciousness, since there is nothing for it to  
know or to make itself known to, it is said to be different from the sentient  
and the insentient.   
Sat-Chit-Ananda (Existence or Being-Consciousness-Bliss) is said to indicate  
that the Supreme is not asat (different from Being), not achit (different from  
Consciousness) and not an anananda (different from Bliss). Because we are in  
the phenomenal world we speak of the Self as Sat-Chit-Ananda (Existence-  
Consciousness-Bliss).

**Mr. C. (S. S. Cohen) wanted to know the mystery of this gigantic world  
illusion.   
Cohen: We speak of the world as illusion, yet everything in it follows rigid  
laws, which proves it to be well-planned and well-regulated.   
Bhagavan Sri Ramana: Yes, he who projected the illusion gave it the  
appearance of order and sound planning.   
Cohen: All spiritual institutions except the Advaitic give prominence to the  
creative aspect of Reality, which they name God. They speak of prophets,  
saints, scriptures, etc. Are they all illusion?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: They all exist in the same way as you, the questioner,  
exist. You are in the relative world, so they are; or else you would not have  
known of them. In dreams one also sees a well-regulated world with saints,  
scriptures, etc., but the moment one wakes up they all disappear. So also  
waking from this dream world into the Supreme Consciousness causes them all to  
disappear.   
Cohen: But how out of Truth does illusion, falsehood spring up?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Maya is not falsehood, although it has the appearance of  
it, but the active side of Reality. It is the maker of forms in Consciousness  
and form means variety, which causes illusion - mind you, all this variety is  
in consciousness and nowhere else; it is only in the mind. On jiva, seeing  
another jiva, forgets its identity with it and thinks of it as separate from  
itself. But the moment it turns its attention on its own nature as  
consciousness, and not as form, the illusion of diversity or separateness  
breaks as a dream breaks when waking takes place.   
Cohen: It is hard to conceive God, the formless, giving rise to forms.   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Why hard? Does not your mind remain formless when you do  
not perceive or think, say, in deep sleep, in samadhi (State of Self-  
absorption), or in a swoon? And does it not create space and relationship when  
it thinks and impels your body to act? Just as your mind devises and your body  
executes in one homogeneous, automatic act, so automatic, in fact, that most  
people are not aware of the process, so does the Divine Intelligence devise  
and plan and His Energy automatically and spontaneously acts - the thought and  
the act are one integral whole. This Creative Energy which is implicit in Pure  
Intelligence is called by various names, one of which is maya or shakti, the  
Creator of forms or images.

**Mr. B. C. Das, the Physics Lecturer, asked: "Yoga means union. I wonder  
union of which with which."   
Bhagwan Sri Ramanai: Exactly. Yoga implies prior division and it means later  
union of one with another. Who is to be united with whom? You are the seeker,  
seeking union with something. That something is apart from you. Your Self is  
intimate to you. You are aware of the Self. Seek it and be it. That will  
expand as the Infinite. Then there will be no question of yoga, etc. Whose is  
the separation (viyoga)? Find it.   
Devotee: Are the stones, etc. destined to be always so?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Who sees stones? They are perceived by your senses, which  
are in turn actuated by your mind. So they are in your mind. Whose mind is it?  
The questioner must find it himself. If the Self be found this question will  
not arise. The Self is more intimate than the objects. Find the subject, and  
the objects will take care of themselves. The objects are seen by different  
persons according to their outlook and these theories are evolved. But who is  
the seer, the cogniser of these theories? It is you. Find your Self. Then  
there is an end of these vagaries of the mind.   
Devotee: What is this mind?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: A bundle of thoughts.   
Devotee: Wherefrom has it its origin?   
BHagwan Sri Ramana: Consciousness of the Self.   
Devotee: Then thoughts are not real.   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: They are not: the only reality is the Self.

**Question: As the bodies and the selves animating them are everywhere  
actually observed to be innumerable how can it be said that the Self is only  
one?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: If the idea `I am the body' is accepted, the selves are  
multiple. The state in which this idea vanishes is the Self since in that  
state there are no other objects. It is for this reason that the Self is  
regarded as one only. Since the body itself does not exist in the natural  
outlook of the real Self, but only in the extroverted outlook of the mind  
which is deluded by the power of illusion, to call Self, the space of  
consciousness, dehi [the possessor of the body] is wrong. The world does not  
exist without the body, the body never exists without the mind, the mind never  
exists without consciousness and consciousness never exists without the  
Reality. For the wise one who has known Self by divining within himself, there  
is nothing other than Self to be known. Why? Because since the ego which  
identifies the form of a body as `I' has perished, he [the wise one] is the  
formless existence-consciousness. The jnani [one who has realized the Self]  
knows he is the Self and that nothing, neither his body nor anything else,  
exists but the Self. To such a one what difference could the presence or  
absence of a body make?   
It is false to speak of realization. What is there to realize? The real is as  
it is always. We are not creating anything new or achieving something which we  
did not have before. The illustration given in books is this. We dig a well  
and create a huge pit. The space in the   
pit or well has not been created by us. We have just removed the earth which  
was filling the space there. The space was there then and is also there now.  
Similarly we have simply to throw out all the age-long samskaras [innate  
tendencies] which are inside us.When all of them have been given up, the Self  
will shine alone.

**Devotee: Is it not possible to get a vision of God?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Yes. You see this and that. Why not see God? Only you must  
know what God is. All are seeing God always. But they do not know it. You find  
out what God is. People see, yet see not, because they know not God.   
Devotee: Should I not go on with repetition of sacred syllables, (mantra  
japa), e.g., Krishna or Rama's name, when I worship images?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Mental japa is very good. That helps meditation. Mind gets  
identified with the repetition and then you get to know what worship (puja)  
really is - the losing of one's individuality in that which is worshipped.   
Devotee: Is the Universal Soul (Paramatma) always different from us?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: That is the common belief, but it is wrong. Think of Him  
as not different from you, and then you achieve identity of Self with God.   
Devotee: Is it not the Advaita doctrine to become one with God?   
BHagwan Sri Ramana: Where is becoming? The thinker is all the while the Real.  
He ultimately realises the fact. Sometimes we forget our identities, as in  
sleep and dreams. But God is perpetual consciousness.   
Devotee: Is not the Master's guidance necessary, besides idol worship?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: How did you start it without advice?   
Devotee: From sacred books (puranas).   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Yes. Someone tells you of God, or Bhagavan Himself tells  
you. In the latter case God Himself is your Master. What matters it who the  
Master is? We really are one with Master or Bhagavan. The Master is God; one  
discovers it in the end. There is no difference between human-guru and God-  
guru.

**An American gentleman, Mr. J. M. Lorey, has been staying in the Asramam for  
about two months. He asked: Sri Lorey: I am leaving tonight. It gives me pain to tear myself away from  
this place. But I must go to America. I ask for a message from the Master. The  
Master understands me even better than I do myself. So I pray for a message to  
keep me up when I am away from the Master.   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana Maharshi: The Master is not outside you as you seem to  
imagine. He is within, is in fact the Self. Recognise this truth. Seek within  
you and find Him there. Then you will have constant communion with Him. The  
message is always there; it is never silent; it can never forsake you: nor can  
you ever move away from the Master.   
Your mind is outgoing. Because of that tendency it sees objects as being  
outside and the Master among them. But the Truth is different. The Master is  
the Self. Turn the mind within and you will find the objects within. You will  
also realise that it is the Master who is your very Self and there is nothing  
but Him.   
Because you identify yourself with the body you have accepted objects as being  
outside you. But are you the body? You are not. You are the Self. There are  
all the objects and the whole universe. Nothing can escape the Self. How then  
can you move away from the Master who is your very Self? Suppose your body  
moves from place to place; does it ever move away from your Self? Similarly,  
you can never be without the Master.   
Mr. Lorey was struck by the answer although he was already familiar with the  
Master's ways. He was even visibly moved. He prayed that the Grace of the  
Master might abide with him.   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: The Master being the Self. Grace is inseparable from the  
Self.   
Mr. L. Saluted Sri Maharshi with intense fervour, saying: that he might be  
enabled to realise the Truth.   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Is there any moment when you have not realised the Self?  
Can you ever be apart from the Self? You are always That.   
Devotee: You are the great Master shedding joy and bliss on the world. Your  
love is indeed unlimited that you choose to abide in the world in human shape!  
But I wish to know if one should necessarily realise one's Self before being  
of help to the country and a leader of men.   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Realise the Self first and the rest will follow.

**Devotee: Swami Vivekananda says that a spiritual Guru can transfer  
spirituality substantially to the disciple.   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana Maharshi: Is there a substance to be transferred? Transfer  
means eradication of the sense of being the disciple. The master does it. Not  
that the man was something at one time and metamorphosed later into another.   
Devotee: Is not Grace the gift of the Guru?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: God, Grace and Guru (Master) are all synonymous and also  
eternal and immanent. Is not the Self already within? Is it for the Guru to  
bestow It by his look? If a Guru thinks so, he does not deserve the name. The  
books say that there are so many kinds of diksha (initiations - hasta diksha,  
sparsa diksha, chakshu diksha, mano diksha, etc.?that is, initiation by hands,  
initiation by touch, initiation by eyes, initiation by mind, etc.  
respectively) They also say that the Guru makes some rites with fire, water,  
japa, mantras, etc., and call such fantastic performances dikshas, as if the  
disciple (sishya) becomes ripe only after such processes are gone through by  
the Guru.   
If the individual is sought he is nowhere to be found. Such is the Guru. Such  
is Dakshinamurti. What did he do? He was silent; the disciples appeared before  
him. He maintained silence, the doubts of the disciples were dispelled, which  
means that they lost their individual identities. That is jnana (Knowledge)  
and not all the verbiage usually associated with it.   
Silence is the most potent form of work. However vast and emphatic the sastras  
(scriptures) may be, they fail in their effect. The Guru is quiet and peace  
prevails in all. His silence is more vast and more emphatic than all the  
sastras put together. These questions arise because of the feeling, that  
having been here so long, heard so much, exerted so hard, one has not gained  
anything. The work proceeding within is not apparent. In fact the Guru is  
always within you.   
Thayumanavar says: "Oh Lord! Coming with me all along the births, never  
abandoning me and finally rescuing me!" Such is the experience of Realisation.  
Srimad Bhagavad Gita says the same in a different way, "We two are not only  
now but have ever been so."   
Devotee: Does not the Guru take a concrete form?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: What is meant by concrete? Because you identify your being  
with your body, you raise this question. Find out if you are the body. The  
Gita says: param bhavam ajanantah (Bh. Gita IX - II) --that those who cannot  
understand the transcendental nature (of Sri Krishna) are fools, deluded by  
ignorance.   
The master appears to dispel that ignorance. As Thayumanavar puts it, he  
appears as a man to dispel the ignorance of a man, just as a deer is used as a  
decoy to capture the wild deer. He has to appear with a body in order to  
eradicate our ignorant 'I-am-the-body' idea.

**A visitor asked: Sri Bhagavan said last night that God is guiding us. Then  
why should we make an effort to do anything?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Who asks you to do so? If there was that faith in the  
guidance of God this question would not have arisen.   
Devotee: The fact is that God guides us. Then what is the use of these  
instructions to people?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: They are for those who seek instructions. If you are firm  
in your belief in the guidance of God, stick to it, and do not concern  
yourself with what happens around you.   
Furthermore, there may be happiness or misery. Be equally indifferent to both  
and abide in the faith of God. That will be so only when one?s faith is strong  
that God looks after all of us.   
Mr. Chopra asked: "How shall I secure that firm faith?"   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Exactly. It is for such as these who want instructions.  
There are persons who seek freedom from misery. They are told that God guides  
all and so there need not be any concern about what happens. If they are of  
the best type they at once believe it and firmly abide by faith in God.   
But there are others who are not so easily convinced of the truth of the bare  
statement. They ask: ?Who is God? What is His nature? Where is He? How can He  
be realised?? and so on. In order to satisfy them intellectual discussion is  
found necessary. Statements are made, their pros and cons are argued, and the  
truth is thus made clear to the intellect. When the matter is understood  
intellectually the earnest seeker begins to apply it practically. He argues at  
every moment, "For whom are these thoughts? Who am I?" and so forth, until he  
is well-established in the conviction that a Higher Power guides us. That is  
firmness of faith. Then all his doubts are cleared and he needs no further  
instructions.   
Devotee: We also have faith in God.   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: If it had been firm no questions would have arisen. The  
person will remain perfectly happy in his Faith in the Omnipotent.   
Devotee: Is the enquiry into the Self the same as the above mentioned faith?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: The enquiry into the Self is inclusive of all, faith,  
devotion, jnana (Knowledge), yoga and all.

**Bhagwan Sri Ramana: In dreamless sleep there is no world, no ego and no  
unhappiness. But the Self remains. In the waking state there are all these;  
yet there is the Self. One has only to remove the transitory happenings in  
order to realise the ever-present beatitude of the Self. Your nature is Bliss.  
Find that on which all the rest are superimposed and you then remain as the  
pure Self.   
Devotee: Yes. It amounts to the removal of alien limitations for discovering  
the ever-present Self. That is what Sankara says. There is no attainment or  
loss.   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Quite so. (Aside) He understands.   
Talk--89   
.................................................................................   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Again, there is no time and space in your sleep. They are  
concepts which arise after the 'I-thought' has arisen. Before the rise of the  
'I-thought' the concepts are absent. Therefore you are beyond time and space.  
The 'I-thought' is only limited 'I'. The real ?I? is unlimited, universal,  
beyond time and space. They are absent in sleep. Just on rising up from sleep,  
and before seeing the objective world, there is a state of awareness which is  
your pure Self. That must be known.   
Devotee: But I do not realise it.   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: It is not an object to be realised. You are that. Who is  
there to realise and what?   
T--311   
.........................................   
The 'I' which rises will also subside. That is the individual 'I' or the  
'I'-concept. That which does not rise will not subside. It is and will be for  
ever. That is the universal 'I', the perfect 'I', or realisation of the Self.

**Question: What are the obstacles which hinder realization of the Self?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana Maharshi: They are habits of mind [vasanas].   
Question: How to overcome the mental habits (vasanas]?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: By realizing the Self.   
Question: This is a vicious circle.   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: It is the ego which raises such difficulties, creating  
obstacles and then suffering from the perplexity of apparent paradoxes. Find  
out who makes the enquiries and the Self will be found.   
Question: Why is this mental bondage so persistent ?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: The nature of bondage is merely the rising, ruinous  
thought `I am different from the reality'. Since one surely cannot remain  
separate from the reality, reject that thought whenever it rises.   
Question: Why do I never remember that I am the Self ?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: People speak of memory and oblivion of the fullness of the  
Self. Oblivion and memory are only thought-forms. They will alternate so long  
as there are thoughts. But reality lies beyond these. Memory or oblivion must  
be dependent on something. That something must be foreign to the Self as well,  
otherwise there would not be oblivion. That upon which memory and oblivion  
depend is the idea of the individual self. When one looks for it, this  
individual `I' is not found because it is not real. Hence this `I' is  
synonymous with illusion or ignorance (maya, avidya or ajnana]. To know that  
there never was ignorance is the goal of all the spiritual teachings.  
Ignorance must be of one who is aware. Awareness is jnana (Knowledge). Jnana  
is eternal and natural, ajnana (ignorance) is unnatural and unreal.   
Question: Having heard this truth, why does not one remain content?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Because samskaras [innate mental tendencies] have not been  
destroyed. Unless the samskaras cease to exist, there will always be doubt and  
confusion. All efforts are directed to destroying doubt and confusion. To do  
so their roots must be cut. Their roots are the samskaras (predispositions).  
These are rendered ineffective by practice as prescribed by the Guru. The Guru  
leaves it to the seeker to do this much so that he might himself find out that  
there is no ignorance. Hearing the truth [sravana] is the first stage. If the  
understanding is not firm one has to practise reflection [manana] and  
uninterrupted contemplation [nididhyasana] on it. These two processes scorch  
the seeds of samskaras (predispositions) so that they are rendered  
ineffective. Some extraordinary people get unshakable jnana (Knowledge) after  
hearing the truth only once. These are the advanced seekers. Beginners take  
longer to gain it.

**Question: How to get rid of the mind?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana Maharshi: Is it the mind that wants to kill itself ? The  
mind cannot kill itself. So your business is to find the real nature of the  
mind. Then you will know that there is no mind. When the Self is sought, the  
mind is nowhere. Abiding in the Self, one need not worry about the mind.   
Question: Is mukti (liberation) the same as realization?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Mukti or liberation is our nature. It is another name for  
us. Our wanting mukti is a very funny thing. It is like a man who is in the  
shade, voluntarily leaving the shade, going into the sun, feeling the severity  
of the heat there, making great efforts to get back into the shade and then  
rejoicing, `How sweet is the shade! I have reached the shade at last!' We are  
all doing exactly the same. We are not different from the reality. We imagine  
we are different, that is we create the bheda bhava [the feeling of  
difference] and then undergo great sadhana [spiritual practices] to get rid of  
the bheda bhava (the feeling of difference) and realize the oneness. Why  
imagine or create bheda bhava (the feeling of difference)and then destroy it?   
Question: This can be realized only by the grace of the master. I was reading  
Sri Bhagavata. It says that bliss can be had only by the dust of the master's  
feet. I pray for grace.   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: What is bliss but your own being ? You are not apart from  
being which is the same as bliss. You are now thinking that you are the mind  
or the body which are both changing and transient. But you are unchanging and  
eternal. That is what you should know.   
Question: It is darkness and I am ignorant.   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: This ignorance must go. Again, who says `I am ignorant '?  
He must be the witness of ignorance. That is what you are. Socrates said, `I  
know that I do not know.' Can it be ignorance? It is wisdom.

**The Malayalam version of Ulladu Narpadu (Reality In Forty Verses) was read  
out by a devotee for the benefit of a visitor. After hearing it, the latter  
asked: What about the reference to duality during one?s effort and unity at  
the end?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana Maharshi: It refers to people who think one must begin  
one's spiritual striving with a dualistic idea. They say that there is God and  
that one must worship and meditate until ultimately the individual merges into  
God. Others say that the individual and the Supreme Being always remain  
separate and never merge. But let's not worry now about what happens at the  
end. All agree that the individual exists now. So let a man discover it--that  
is discover his Self. There will be time enough afterwards to find out whether  
the Self is to merge in the Supreme or is a part of it or remains separate.  
Let us not forestall the conclusion. Keep an open mind, dive within and find  
the Self. The truth will dawn upon you all right, so why try to decide  
beforehand whether it is absolute or qualified unity or duality? There is no  
meaning in doing so. Your decision would have to be made by logic and  
intellect, but the intellect derives its light from the Self (the Highest  
Power) so how can its reflected and partial light envisage the entire and  
original light? The intellect cannot attain to the Self, so how can it  
ascertain its nature?   
While explaining to an American lady, Sri Bhagavan said: The Self alone is  
Real. All else is unreal. The mind and intellect have no existence apart from  
you. The Bible says: "Be still and know that I am God". Stillness is the only  
thing needed to realise that 'I am' is God.   
Later He added: The whole Vedanta is contained in the two Biblical statements  
"I am that I am" and "Be still and know that I am God".   
For one who found Self-enquiry too difficult, He would recommend worship and  
submission.   
Devotee: What should one think of when meditating?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: What is meditation? It is the suspension of thoughts. You  
are perturbed by thoughts which rush one after another. Hold on to one thought  
so that others are expelled. Continuous practice gives the necessary strength  
of mind to engage in meditation. Meditation differs according to the degree of  
advancement of the seeker. If one is fit for it one can hold directly to the  
thinker; and the thinker will automatically sink into his source, which is  
Pure Consciousness. If one cannot directly hold on to the thinker, one must  
meditate on God; and in due course the same individual will have become  
sufficiently pure to hold on to the thinker and sink into the absolute Being.

**In the afternoon Krishna Jivrajani said to Sri Bhagavan Ramana, "During  
sadhana (spiritual practice) I feel that something in me is going up. Is that  
right or should it go down?"   
Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi: Never mind whether anything goes up or down.  
Does it exist without you? Never forget that. Whatever experience may come  
remember who has the experience and thus cling to 'I' or the Self.   
Jivrajani: Bhagavan has said one must dive deep into oneself like pearl divers  
with breath and speech controlled and discover the Self or attain the Self. So  
does Bhagavan advise me to practise breath-control?   
Bhagavan Sri Ramana: Breath-control is a help in controlling the mind and is  
advised for such as find they cannot control the mind without some such aid.  
For those who can control their mind and concentrate, it is not necessary. It  
can be used at the beginning until one is able to control the mind, but then  
it should be given up. Since mind and prana rise from the same source, control  
of one gives control of the other also.   
Jivrajani: Is it good to strain to achieve breath-control?   
Bhagavan Sri Ramana: No, straining is not good. Only a little pranayama should  
be done at the beginning--as much as is possible without undue strain.   
Jivrajani: I have never been able to understand Bhagavan's explanation as to  
how ajnana (ignorance) comes about.   
I (Devaraja Mudaliar) put in, "Bhagavan has said, 'Find out to whom is the  
ajnana (ignorance) and then the doubt will be dispelled'."   
Bhagavan Sri Ramana: Ignorance of what ?   
Jivrajani: Bhagavan has said that when the ego is submerged or killed  
something else arises within us as 'I-I'. Will Bhagavan please tell me more  
about that?   
Bhagavan Sri Ramana: Everyone has to find that out by his own experience. It  
cannot be described. In the same way, you say, 'something goes up'; can you  
describe that?   
Jivrajani: It is only by developing the intellect that intuition can be  
attained; in fact perfection of intellect is intuition, is that not so?   
Bhagavan Sri Ramana: How can that be? The merging of the intellect in the  
source from which it arose gives birth to intuition, as you call it. The  
intellect is of use only to see outside things, the outside world. Perfection  
of the intellect would lead only to seeing the outside world well. But the  
intellect is of no use at all for seeing within, for turning inwards towards  
the Self. For that, it has to be killed or extinguished, or in other words it  
has to merge in the source from which it sprang.

**Bhagwan Sri Ramana Maharshi: Now a question is raised: How can jiva  
(individual soul) rise up from the Self? I must answer. Only know Your Real  
Being, then you will not raise this question. Why should a man consider  
himself separate? How was he before being born or how will he be after death?  
Why waste time in such discussions? What was your form in deep sleep? Why do  
you consider yourself as an individual?   
Devotee: My form remains subtle in deep sleep.   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: As is the effect so is the cause. As is the tree so is its  
seed. The whole tree is contained in the seed which later manifests as the  
tree. The expanded tree must have a substratum which we call maya. As a matter  
of truth there is neither seed nor tree. There is only Being.   
Devotee.: Vasanakshaya (total end of all predispositions) - Mano nasa  
(annihilation of mind) - Atma-sakshatkara (Realisation of the Self). They seem  
to be interdependent.   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: The different expressions have only one meaning. They  
differ according to the individual?s stage of progress. Dispassion,  
Realisation, all mean the same thing; also they say 'practice and dispassion'.  
Why practice? Because the modes of mind once subside and then rise up; again  
subside and rise up, and so on.   
Devotee: Beginningless predisposition makes one do wrong. Without jnana  
(Knowledge of the real Self) this predisposition cannot vanish. But jnana  
looks almost impossible. Expiation alone cannot undo all the karma; for how  
much expiation will be needed! Look where we will! Everything looks difficult,  
even impossible. Association with the wise seems to be the only cure of all  
ills.   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: What is to be done? Reality is One only. How can It be  
realised? Realisation is thus an illusion. Practice seems to be necessary. Who  
is to practise? Looking for the doer, the act and the accessories disappear.  
Moreover, if Realisation is not present here and now, how can It, newly got,  
be of any use? What is permanent must be eternally present. Can it be newly  
got and be permanent also? Realise what is present here and now. The sages did  
so before and still do that only. Hence they say that it looks as if newly  
got. Once veiled by ignorance and later revealed, Reality looks as if newly  
realised. But it is not new.

**Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi said to Lady Bateman: There is a fixed state; sleep, dream and waking states are mere movements in  
it. They are like pictures moving on the screen in a cinema show.   
Everyone sees the screen as well as the pictures but ignores the screen and  
takes in the pictures alone. The Jnani (Self-realized) however considers only  
the screen and not the pictures. The pictures certainly move on the screen yet  
do not affect it. The screen itself does not move but remains stationary.   
Similarly, a person travels in a train and thinks that he moves. Really  
speaking he sits and reposes in his seat, and it is the train which is  
steaming fast. He however superimposes the motion of the train on himself  
because he has identified himself with the body. He says, "I have passed one  
station - now another - yet another - and so on". A little consideration will  
show that he sits unmoved and the stations run past him. But that does not  
prevent him from saying that he has traveled all the way as if he exerted  
himself to move every foot of the way.   
The Jnani is fully aware that the true state of Being remains fixed and  
stationary and that all actions go on around him. His nature does not change  
and his state is not affected in the least. He looks on everything with  
unconcern and remains blissful himself.   
His is the true state and also the primal and natural state of being. When  
once the man reaches it he gets fixed there. Fixed once, fixed ever he will  
be. Therefore that state which prevailed in the days of Pathala Linga Cellar  
(Bhagwan Sri Ramana's State before Sri Ramanasramam came into existence)  
continues uninterrupted, with only this difference that the body remained  
there immobile but is now active.   
There is no difference between a Jnani (Self-realized) and an ajnani (one who  
is ignorant of one's real Self) in their conduct. The difference lies only in  
their angles of vision. The ignorant man identifies himself with the ego and  
mistakes its activities for those of the Self, whereas the ego of the Jnani  
(Self-realized) has been lost and he does not limit himself to this body or  
that, this event or that, and so on. There is action in seeming inaction, and  
also inaction in seeming action.

**Question: So ultimately Iswara (God) is not real?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana Maharshi: Existence of Iswara (God) follows from our  
conception of Iswara (God). Let us first know whose concept he is. The concept  
will be only according to the one who conceives. Find out who you are and the  
other problems will solve themselves. Iswara, God, the creator, the personal  
God, is the last of the unreal forms to go. Only the absolute being is real.  
Hence, not only the world, not only the ego, but also the personal God are of  
unreality. We must find the absolute - nothing less.   
Question: You say that even the highest God is still only an idea. Does that  
mean that there is no God?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: No, there is an Iswara (God).   
Question: Does he exist in any particular place or form?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana : If the individual is a form, even Self, the source, who  
is the Lord, will also appear to be a form. If one is not a form, since there  
then cannot be knowledge of other things, will that statement that God has a  
form be correct? God assumes any form imagined by the devotee through repeated  
thinking in prolonged meditation. Though he thus assumes endless names, the  
real formless consciousness alone is God. With regard to his location, God  
does not reside in any place other than the Heart. It is due to illusion,  
caused by the ego, the `I am the body' idea, that the kingdom of God is  
conceived to be elsewhere. Be sure that the Heart is the kingdom of God. Know  
that you are the perfect, shining light which not only makes the existence of  
God's kingdom possible, but also allows it to be seen as some wonderful  
heaven. To know this is alone jnana. Therefore, the kingdom of God is within  
you. The unlimited space of turiyatita [beyond the four states, i.e. the  
Self], which shines suddenly, in all its fullness, within the Heart of a  
highly mature aspirant during the state of complete absorption of mind, as if  
a fresh and previously unknown experience, is the rarely-attained and true  
Siva-loka [the kingdom of God], which shines by the light of Self.   
Question: They say that the jiva [individual] is subject to the evil effects  
of illusion such as limited vision and knowledge, whereas Iswara (God) has  
all-pervading vision and knowledge. It is also said that jiva and Iswara  
become identical if the individual discards his limited vision and knowledge.  
Should not Iswara also discard his particular characteristics such as all-  
pervading vision and knowledge? They too are illusions, aren't they?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Is that your doubt? First discard your own limited vision  
and then there will be time enough to think of Iswara's all-pervading vision  
and knowledge. First get rid of your own limited knowledge. Why do you worry  
about Iswara? He will look after himself. Has he not got as much capacity as  
we have? Why should We worry about whether he possesses all-pervading vision  
and knowledge or not? It is indeed a great thing if we can take care of  
ourselves.   
Question: But does God know everything?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: The Vedas declare God to be omniscient only to those who  
ignorantly think themselves to be people of little knowledge. But if one  
attains and knows him as he really is, it will be found that God does not know  
anything, because his nature is the ever-real whole, other than which nothing  
exists to be known.   
Question: Why do religions speak of Gods, heaven, hell, etc.?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Only to make the people realize that they are on a par  
with this world and that the Self alone is real. The religions are according  
to the view-point of the seeker.   
Question: Do Vishnu, Siva, etc., exist?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Individual human souls are not the only beings known.

it. Similarly Pure Knowledge does not contain objects in it nor reflect  
objects. Only with the limiting adjunct, the mind, it reflects the world.  
Neither in samadhi (the state of Self-absorption) nor in deep sleep does the  
world remain. There cannot be illusion either in bright light or in total  
darkness. Only in dim light a rope seems a snake. Similarly Pure Consciousness  
remains light only; it is pure knowledge. The mind rising from it is deluded  
that the objects remain apart.   
Devotee: So then the mind is the mirror.   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Mind - mind what is it? It is a mixture of Chit  
(intelligence) and sankalpas (thoughts). Therefore it forms all these - the  
mirror, light, darkness and the reflections.   
Devotee: But I do not see it.   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Chidakasa (chit-ether) is Pure Knowledge only, It is the  
source of mind. Just at the moment of rising up, the mind is only light; only  
afterwards the thought 'I am this' rises up; this 'I-thought' forms the jiva  
(individual soul) and the world. The first light is the pure mind, the mind  
ether or Isvara (God). Its modes manifest as objects. Because it contains all  
these objects within itself it is called the mind-ether. Why ether? Like ether  
containing objects it contains the thoughts, therefore it is the mind-ether.  
Again, just as the physical ether though accommodating all the gross objects  
(the whole universe) is itself the content of the mind-ether, so also the  
latter is itself the content of Chit-ether. The last one is Chit Itself. There  
are no things contained in it. It remains as Pure Knowledge only.   
Devotee: Why call it ether? Physical ether is not sentient.   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Ether denotes not only the insentient physical ether but  
also Pure Knowledge. Knowledge does not consist in knowing objects: this is  
relative knowledge. But Knowledge in its purity remains all alone, One,  
unique, transcendent Light!

**Question: Why is samsara (World)-- creation and manifestation so full of  
sorrow and evil ?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana Maharshi: God's will!   
Question: Why does God will it so?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: It is inscrutable. No motive can be attributed to that  
power - no desire no end to achieve can be asserted of that one infinite, all-  
wise and all-powerful being. God is untouched by activities, which take place  
in his presence. Compare the sun and the world activities. There is no meaning  
in attributing responsibility and motive to the one before it becomes many.   
Question: Does everything happen by the will of God?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: It is not possible for anyone to do anything opposed to  
the ordinance of God, who has the ability to do everything. Therefore to  
remain silent at the feet of God, having given up all the anxieties of the  
wicked, defective and delusive mind, is best.   
Question: Is there a separate being Iswara [personal God] who is the rewarder  
of virtue and punisher of sins? Is there a God?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Yes.   
Question: What is he like?   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana: Iswara (God) has individuality in mind and body, which are  
perishable, but at the same time he has also the transcendental consciousness  
and liberation inwardly. Iswara (God), the personal God, the supreme creator  
of the universe really does exist. But this is true only from the relative  
standpoint of those who have not realized the truth, those people who believe  
in the reality of individual souls. From the absolute standpoint the sage  
cannot accept any other existence than the impersonal Self, one and formless.  
Iswara (God) has a physical body, a form and a name, but it is not so gross as  
this material body. It can be seen in visions in the form created by the  
devotee. The forms and names of God are many and various and differ with each  
religion. His essence is the same as ours, the real Self being only one and  
without form. Hence forms he assumes are only creations or appearances. Iswara  
(God) is immanent in every person and every object throughout the universe.  
The totality of all things and beings constitutes God. There is a power out of  
which a small fraction has become all this universe, and the remainder is in  
reserve. Both this reserve power plus the manifested power as material world  
together constitute Iswara (God).

SELF-ENQUIRY: "UNLESS YOU ENQUIRE, WITHIN YOURSELF, THROUGH YOURSELF, INTO YOURSELF, IT WILL  
BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO BECOME ONE WITH YOUR OWN SELF."   
V. 1, Self-enquiry, Padamalai   
"THE STATE OF THE SELF IS REACHED BY GOING BACK THE WAY ONE CAME. WHICHEVER  
OTHER PATH ONE TRAVELS ON, IT HAS TO TAKE YOU HERE AND TAKE REFUGE HERE."   
V. 7, Self-enquiry, Padamalai   
Bhagwan Sri Ramana Maharshi: "Actions such as 'going' and 'coming' belong only to the body. And so, when  
one says, 'I went, I came', it amounts to saying that the body is 'I'. But,  
can the body be said to be the consciousness 'I', since the body was not  
before it was born, is made up of the five elements, is nonexistent in the  
state of deep sleep, and becomes a corpse when dead? Can this body which is  
inert like a log of wood be said to shine as 'I-I'? Therefore, the  
'I-consciousness' which at first arises in respect of the body is referred to  
variously as self-conceit (tarbodham), egoity (ahankara), nescience (avidya),  
maya, impurity (mala), and individual soul (jiva). Can we remain without  
enquiring into this? Is it not for our redemption through enquiry that all the  
scriptures declare that the destruction of 'self-conceit' is release (mukti)"   
Therefore, leaving the corpse-like body as an actual corpse and remaining  
without even uttering 'I' by mouth, if one now keenly enquires, "What is it  
that rises as 'I'?, then in the Heart a certain soundless sphurana, 'I-I',  
will shine forth of its own accord. It is an awareness that is single and  
undivided, the thoughts which are many and divided having disappeared. If one  
remains still without leaving it, even the sphurana--having completely  
annihilated the sense of the individuality, the form of the ego, 'I am the  
body' will itself in the end subside, just like the camphor. This alone is  
said to be the liberation by great ones and Scriptures."
