## The Good and the Capable  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: November 26, 2009, 08:04:16 AM  
---  
In this world, we see people who are either good or capable   
in worldly activities. The great combination is quite rare.   
People who are good (in spiritual outlook and dharmic disposition),   
are not capable in the worldly activities. My wife is a classic   
example. She may chant Soundarya Lahari from Verse 100 to   
Verse 1 in the reverse order, but can never operate the computer   
excepting typing an email to my son. She may just cook for two   
of us, but may not be able to arrange a dinner for 25 people.   
There are people who are capable but definitely not good in their   
disposition. They end up like Harshad Mehtas, Prabhakarans   
and George Bush-s in their lives.   
People who are good and capable are quite rare. Like Chozha   
Kings who were great Siva bhaktas but destroyed the enemies   
who wanted to invade them, like "flies to wanton boys."   
At the end of the day, I consider the people are good are the   
salt of the earth. The earth lives because of them and rains   
pour due to them.   
Arunachala Siva.

Sri Ramakrishna said: "God has form and He is formless too. Further, He is beyond both form and  
formlessness. No one can limit Him."   
No can can limit the Universal Consciousness.   
If someone thinks that only recluse can get Self-Realisation, a Lahiri  
Mahasaya is born.   
If someone thinks that only devotees of Siva can get God-Realisation, a  
Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is born.   
If someone thinks that only men can get God-Realisation, a Maa Anandamayi is  
born.   
If someone thinks that God cannot be realised through idol worship, a  
Ramakrisha is born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realised through idol worship, a Ramana  
Maharshi is born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realized through rituals, a Buddha is  
born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realized in India, a Jesus Christ is  
born.   
If someone thinks that only economically sound people can have realization, a  
Nisargadatta Maharaj is born.   
If someone thinks that only grown-ups can get self-realization, a Jnana  
Sambandar is born.   
If someone thinks that only learned people can get self-realization, a Sarada  
Devi is born.   
If someone thinks a learned people can never get Self-realization, a  
Shankaracharya is born.   
If someone thinks that one can get self-realisation only by satsangs of a  
personal guru, A J. Krishnamurthy is born.   
Whenever there appeared to be a limiting opinion about Universal  
Consciousness, it reappears in a form and shows that it is beyond that limit  
also.   
The Universal Consciousness is beyond all forms.   
However for devotees It is amenable to all forms.   
It is the Krishna of Krishna devotees.   
It is the Shiva of Shiva devotees.   
It is the Ramakrishna of Ramakrisha devotees.   
If is the Ramana of Ramana devotees.   
It is the Christ of Christ devotees.   
It is the Buddha of Buddha devotees.   
So Sri Ramakrisha said: "God has form and He is formless too. Further, He is beyond both form and  
formlessness. No one can limit Him."

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent.   
The universal consciousness cuts across all barriers. That is why   
it is universal, limitless, beyond names and forms. But a person   
who has realized this Advaita Siddhi sees in every form and name   
the Consciousness.   
Saint Jnana Deva, who was in and out a Panduranga (Krishna)   
bhakta had this Advaita Siddhi towards the end of his life. He   
stopped going to the temple, sat simply on the banks of Chandrbhaga river and  
whatever devotees gave him, he was   
eating. Once devotees placed a couple of roti (bread) pieces   
and some jaggery on a leaf and left. Soon a dog came and grabbed   
one roti and was running away. The devotees were aghast not   
knowing what to do? Jnana Deva ran behind the dog, caught it   
and said: O Panduranga, you have taken only the roti. How will   
you eat this dry food. Why not you take this jaggery also?   
Bhagavan Ramana once had a monkey which was stoned and beaten   
up. He used to nurse it everyday. Soon it became alright. On   
seeing the wounds healed up, He rejoiced. The same was the case   
with another dog also. Sri Arunachala Pancharatnam Verse 5: Unnaikkandu ellam unnruvai   
Anniyamil anbu seyym annon.....   
He who, with Heart to you surrendered,   
Beholds for ever you alone.   
Sees all things as forms of you   
And loves and serves them as none other   
Than the Self, O Arunachala!   
Triumphs because he is immersed   
In you whose being is pure bliss.   
Thank you, silentgreen.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai,   
Like the mind rid of impurities becoming the Self, normal consciousness  
becomes Universal Consciousness or the state of   
All-knowledge.

How can mind become Self?   
mind is mithya.   
Self is Truth.   
So one cannot become the other.   
There is really no difference between normal and universal consciousness.  
There is only one: Consciousness.   
like the space in a pot and space outside. .. we have artificially marked it  
as universal consciousness and normal consciousness.   
There is just Consciousness. what is normal consciousness is also the  
universal.

Dear srkudai,   
We begin saying that the world is unreal. It is for the purpose of   
continuing our seeking the Self. Once the Self is realized, the world   
is Real, Brahma Swarupam. Similarly, the mind is mithya, seemingly   
real on seemingly unreal for the purpose of sadhana. Once the   
self realization takes place it becomes the Brahman.   
*   
Bhagavan Ramana has said: The inherent nature of the Self is Bliss. Some kind of knowledge   
has to be admitted, even in the realization of the supreme bliss.   
It may be said to be subtler than the subtlest.   
The word Vijnana [clear knowledge] is used both to denote the realization of  
the Self and knowing the objects. The Self is wisdom. It functions in two  
ways. When associated with ego, the knowledge is objective [vijnana]. When  
divested of the ego, and the universal Self is realized, it is also called  
Vijnana. The word raises a mental concept. Therefore, we say that the Self  
realized sage knows by his mind, but his mind is pure. Again we say that by  
the vibrating mind is impure and the placid mind is pure. The pure mind is  
itself Brahman. Therefore it follows that Brahman is not other than the mind  
of the Sage.   
*   
To a question as to what is meant by Jnana and Vijnana, Bhagavan Ramana has  
answered in that context: These words may mean differently according to the  
context. Jnana = Samanya Jnana or Pure Consciousness. Vijnana = Visesha  
Jnana. Visesha Jnana may be: a) wordly [relative knowledge]; and b]  
Transcendental - Self realization.   
*   
Guru Vachaka Kovai Verse 1106 states: The pure mind of a Jnani, which exists and shines as the witness, is a mirror  
that reflects even the impure thoughts that arise in his presence, in those  
whose minds are completely warped. Thus,   
he mystifies the minds of others in his presence, by giving the impression  
that he is a deluded person.   
*   
Muruganar also accepted this concept of the impure and pure mind,   
and called them as Chittarivu [small knowledge] and Perarivu [grand  
knowledge].   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian garu,   
Bhagavan Ramana says, When the indefinable power of Brahman separates itself  
from Brahman and, in union with the reflection of consciousness (Chidabhasa)  
assumes various forms, it is called the **impure mind**. When it becomes free  
from the reflection of consciousness (abhasa), through discrimination, it is  
called the **pure mind**.   
But there are no answers to questions like   
why does we assume various forms i.e have impure mind??   
how did karma started in the beginning?   
why god created the universe ??   
Where does maya come from and how did it originate?   
But when these kind of questions were asked by some devotees ramana's typical  
answer was to ask to whom these doubts arise? His typical brahmastram :-)

Dear Subramanian,   
That is not like that.   
What is mithya is asat. it cannot become SAT.   
Look at the following statements: The Post is the Ghost.   
The Ghost came from Post.   
The Ghost is unreal.   
Mind is the Ghost. Self is SAT. The Ghost does not "Become" Post. The Ghost is  
not there at all. There was always the post.   
So now, that does not mean, the "Ghost-Like" Appearance vanishes. IT  
continues; but you are not confused that it is Ghost.   
You only see Self.   
This is what Bhagavan said when he said "I have no thoughts". Not that the  
thoughts are not appearing etc. But that they are like the   
Ghost imagined on the pole. They continue to appear. .. but we know there is  
only Consciousness.   
Love!   
Silence

Where were the thoughts during sushupti?   
Why then the thoughts arise again after waking from sleep?   
As long as there is 'I' thought, so long there will be mind, thoughts.   
When the I is merged, thoughts, Mind, all are naught.   
This is the essence of Dakshinamurthy. the Universal consciousness is Pure  
without a pinch of 'I-ness' \- no mind !!   
It is simple awareness, where there is no 'I' arising,   
That is consciousness.   
When there is I thought popping out, there is mind.   
As long there is mind, there is Jagart Swapna Sushupti.   
Consciousness is beyond these three states, that implies, destruction of mind,  
which itself is I thought.   
Consciousness is (state) where there is no one who can own anymore the thought  
of consciousness. So long there is mind, there is owner to thoughts.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

so is there no consciousness when there are thoughts?   
consciousness IS.   
thoughts or no thougts. how does it matter. Infact that there is a thought  
itself is a proof that there is Consciousness.   
And infact, even now Consciousness is without thoughts. Consciousness is ever  
without thoughts: As even space is without clouds. Clouds float in space; but  
space is without clouds.   
So presence or absence of clouds is not a problem for Space.

Consciousness ever is, no doubt about it,   
its as simple as the difference between Sri Ramana Maharshi and us...   
Curds is found in Milk itself, can we drink milk thinking it as curds? there  
is difference, Milk is milk, curds is curds, though both are in essence one  
and the same.   
When there is curds, it is no more Milk.   
Thats the point

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent.   
The universal consciousness cuts across all barriers. That is why   
it is universal, limitless, beyond names and forms. But a person   
who has realized this Advaita Siddhi sees in every form and name   
the Consciousness.   
Saint Jnana Deva, who was in and out a Panduranga (Krishna)   
bhakta had this Advaita Siddhi towards the end of his life. He   
stopped going to the temple, sat simply on the banks of Chandrbhaga river and  
whatever devotees gave him, he was   
eating. Once devotees placed a couple of roti (bread) pieces   
and some jaggery on a leaf and left. Soon a dog came and grabbed   
one roti and was running away. The devotees were aghast not   
knowing what to do? Jnana Deva ran behind the dog, caught it   
and said: O Panduranga, you have taken only the roti. How will   
you eat this dry food. Why not you take this jaggery also?   
Bhagavan Ramana once had a monkey which was stoned and beaten   
up. He used to nurse it everyday. Soon it became alright. On   
seeing the wounds healed up, He rejoiced. The same was the case   
with another dog also. Sri Arunachala Pancharatnam Verse 5: Unnaikkandu ellam unnruvai   
Anniyamil anbu seyym annon.....   
He who, with Heart to you surrendered,   
Beholds for ever you alone.   
Sees all things as forms of you   
And loves and serves them as none other   
Than the Self, O Arunachala!   
Triumphs because he is immersed   
In you whose being is pure bliss.   
Thank you, silentgreen.   
Arunachala Siva.

How can mind become Self?   
mind is mithya.   
Self is Truth.   
So one cannot become the other.   
There is really no difference between normal and universal consciousness.  
There is only one: Consciousness.

Dear srkudai,   
We begin saying that the world is unreal. It is for the purpose of   
continuing our seeking the Self. Once the Self is realized, the world   
is Real, Brahma Swarupam. Similarly, the mind is mithya, seemingly   
real on seemingly unreal for the purpose of sadhana. Once the   
self realization takes place it becomes the Brahman.   
*   
Bhagavan Ramana has said: The inherent nature of the Self is Bliss. Some kind of knowledge   
has to be admitted, even in the realization of the supreme bliss.   
It may be said to be subtler than the subtlest.   
The word Vijnana [clear knowledge] is used both to denote the realization of  
the Self and knowing the objects. The Self is wisdom. It functions in two  
ways. When associated with ego, the knowledge is objective [vijnana]. When  
divested of the ego, and the universal Self is realized, it is also called  
Vijnana. The word raises a mental concept. Therefore, we say that the Self  
realized sage knows by his mind, but his mind is pure. Again we say that by  
the vibrating mind is impure and the placid mind is pure. The pure mind is  
itself Brahman. Therefore it follows that Brahman is not other than the mind  
of the Sage.   
*   
To a question as to what is meant by Jnana and Vijnana, Bhagavan Ramana has  
answered in that context: These words may mean differently according to the  
context. Jnana = Samanya Jnana or Pure Consciousness. Vijnana = Visesha  
Jnana. Visesha Jnana may be: a) wordly [relative knowledge]; and b]  
Transcendental - Self realization.   
*   
Guru Vachaka Kovai Verse 1106 states: The pure mind of a Jnani, which exists and shines as the witness, is a mirror  
that reflects even the impure thoughts that arise in his presence, in those  
whose minds are completely warped. Thus,   
he mystifies the minds of others in his presence, by giving the impression  
that he is a deluded person.   
*   
Muruganar also accepted this concept of the impure and pure mind,   
and called them as Chittarivu [small knowledge] and Perarivu [grand  
knowledge].   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian garu,   
Bhagavan Ramana says, When the indefinable power of Brahman separates itself  
from Brahman and, in union with the reflection of consciousness (Chidabhasa)  
assumes various forms, it is called the **impure mind**. When it becomes free  
from the reflection of consciousness (abhasa), through discrimination, it is  
called the **pure mind**.   
But there are no answers to questions like   
why does we assume various forms i.e have impure mind??   
how did karma started in the beginning?   
why god created the universe ??   
Where does maya come from and how did it originate?   
But when these kind of questions were asked by some devotees ramana's typical  
answer was to ask to whom these doubts arise? His typical brahmastram :-)

Dear Subramanian,   
That is not like that.   
What is mithya is asat. it cannot become SAT.   
Look at the following statements: The Post is the Ghost.   
The Ghost came from Post.   
The Ghost is unreal.   
Mind is the Ghost. Self is SAT. The Ghost does not "Become" Post. The Ghost is  
not there at all. There was always the post.   
So now, that does not mean, the "Ghost-Like" Appearance vanishes. IT  
continues; but you are not confused that it is Ghost.   
You only see Self.   
This is what Bhagavan said when he said "I have no thoughts". Not that the  
thoughts are not appearing etc. But that they are like the   
Ghost imagined on the pole. They continue to appear. .. but we know there is  
only Consciousness.   
Love!   
Silence

Where were the thoughts during sushupti?   
Why then the thoughts arise again after waking from sleep?   
As long as there is 'I' thought, so long there will be mind, thoughts.   
When the I is merged, thoughts, Mind, all are naught.   
This is the essence of Dakshinamurthy. the Universal consciousness is Pure  
without a pinch of 'I-ness' \- no mind !!   
It is simple awareness, where there is no 'I' arising,   
That is consciousness.   
When there is I thought popping out, there is mind.   
As long there is mind, there is Jagart Swapna Sushupti.   
Consciousness is beyond these three states, that implies, destruction of mind,  
which itself is I thought.   
Consciousness is (state) where there is no one who can own anymore the thought  
of consciousness. So long there is mind, there is owner to thoughts.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

so is there no consciousness when there are thoughts?   
consciousness IS.   
thoughts or no thougts. how does it matter. Infact that there is a thought  
itself is a proof that there is Consciousness.   
And infact, even now Consciousness is without thoughts. Consciousness is ever  
without thoughts: As even space is without clouds. Clouds float in space; but  
space is without clouds.   
So presence or absence of clouds is not a problem for Space.

Consciousness ever is, no doubt about it,   
its as simple as the difference between Sri Ramana Maharshi and us...   
Curds is found in Milk itself, can we drink milk thinking it as curds? there  
is difference, Milk is milk, curds is curds, though both are in essence one  
and the same.   
When there is curds, it is no more Milk.   
Thats the point

Ramana ate food, we eat food.   
Ramana slept, we sleep.

Sri Ramakrishna said: "God has form and He is formless too. Further, He is beyond both form and  
formlessness. No one can limit Him."   
No can can limit the Universal Consciousness.   
If someone thinks that only recluse can get Self-Realisation, a Lahiri  
Mahasaya is born.   
If someone thinks that only devotees of Siva can get God-Realisation, a  
Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is born.   
If someone thinks that only men can get God-Realisation, a Maa Anandamayi is  
born.   
If someone thinks that God cannot be realised through idol worship, a  
Ramakrisha is born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realised through idol worship, a Ramana  
Maharshi is born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realized through rituals, a Buddha is  
born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realized in India, a Jesus Christ is  
born.   
If someone thinks that only economically sound people can have realization, a  
Nisargadatta Maharaj is born.   
If someone thinks that only grown-ups can get self-realization, a Jnana  
Sambandar is born.   
If someone thinks that only learned people can get self-realization, a Sarada  
Devi is born.   
If someone thinks a learned people can never get Self-realization, a  
Shankaracharya is born.   
If someone thinks that one can get self-realisation only by satsangs of a  
personal guru, A J. Krishnamurthy is born.   
Whenever there appeared to be a limiting opinion about Universal  
Consciousness, it reappears in a form and shows that it is beyond that limit  
also.   
The Universal Consciousness is beyond all forms.   
However for devotees It is amenable to all forms.   
It is the Krishna of Krishna devotees.   
It is the Shiva of Shiva devotees.   
It is the Ramakrishna of Ramakrisha devotees.   
If is the Ramana of Ramana devotees.   
It is the Christ of Christ devotees.   
It is the Buddha of Buddha devotees.   
So Sri Ramakrisha said: "God has form and He is formless too. Further, He is beyond both form and  
formlessness. No one can limit Him."

Vijnana. The word raises a mental concept. Therefore, we say that the Self  
realized sage knows by his mind, but his mind is pure. Again we say that by  
the vibrating mind is impure and the placid mind is pure. The pure mind is  
itself Brahman. Therefore it follows that Brahman is not other than the mind  
of the Sage.   
*   
To a question as to what is meant by Jnana and Vijnana, Bhagavan Ramana has  
answered in that context: These words may mean differently according to the  
context. Jnana = Samanya Jnana or Pure Consciousness. Vijnana = Visesha  
Jnana. Visesha Jnana may be: a) wordly [relative knowledge]; and b]  
Transcendental - Self realization.   
*   
Guru Vachaka Kovai Verse 1106 states: The pure mind of a Jnani, which exists and shines as the witness, is a mirror  
that reflects even the impure thoughts that arise in his presence, in those  
whose minds are completely warped. Thus,   
he mystifies the minds of others in his presence, by giving the impression  
that he is a deluded person.   
*   
Muruganar also accepted this concept of the impure and pure mind,   
and called them as Chittarivu [small knowledge] and Perarivu [grand  
knowledge].   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian garu,   
Bhagavan Ramana says, When the indefinable power of Brahman separates itself  
from Brahman and, in union with the reflection of consciousness (Chidabhasa)  
assumes various forms, it is called the **impure mind**. When it becomes free  
from the reflection of consciousness (abhasa), through discrimination, it is  
called the **pure mind**.   
But there are no answers to questions like   
why does we assume various forms i.e have impure mind??   
how did karma started in the beginning?   
why god created the universe ??   
Where does maya come from and how did it originate?   
But when these kind of questions were asked by some devotees ramana's typical  
answer was to ask to whom these doubts arise? His typical brahmastram :-)

Dear Subramanian,   
That is not like that.   
What is mithya is asat. it cannot become SAT.   
Look at the following statements: The Post is the Ghost.   
The Ghost came from Post.   
The Ghost is unreal.   
Mind is the Ghost. Self is SAT. The Ghost does not "Become" Post. The Ghost is  
not there at all. There was always the post.   
So now, that does not mean, the "Ghost-Like" Appearance vanishes. IT  
continues; but you are not confused that it is Ghost.   
You only see Self.   
This is what Bhagavan said when he said "I have no thoughts". Not that the  
thoughts are not appearing etc. But that they are like the   
Ghost imagined on the pole. They continue to appear. .. but we know there is  
only Consciousness.   
Love!   
Silence

Where were the thoughts during sushupti?   
Why then the thoughts arise again after waking from sleep?   
As long as there is 'I' thought, so long there will be mind, thoughts.   
When the I is merged, thoughts, Mind, all are naught.   
This is the essence of Dakshinamurthy. the Universal consciousness is Pure  
without a pinch of 'I-ness' \- no mind !!   
It is simple awareness, where there is no 'I' arising,   
That is consciousness.   
When there is I thought popping out, there is mind.   
As long there is mind, there is Jagart Swapna Sushupti.   
Consciousness is beyond these three states, that implies, destruction of mind,  
which itself is I thought.   
Consciousness is (state) where there is no one who can own anymore the thought  
of consciousness. So long there is mind, there is owner to thoughts.

And infact, even now Consciousness is without thoughts. Consciousness is ever

Consciousness ever is, no doubt about it,   
its as simple as the difference between Sri Ramana Maharshi and us...   
Curds is found in Milk itself, can we drink milk thinking it as curds? there  
is difference, Milk is milk, curds is curds, though both are in essence one  
and the same.   
When there is curds, it is no more Milk.   
Thats the point

## Universal Consciousness: Beyond all limitations  
Author: silentgreen         Date: November 27, 2009, 12:16:42 PM

Sri Ramakrishna said: "God has form and He is formless too. Further, He is beyond both form and  
formlessness. No one can limit Him."   
No can can limit the Universal Consciousness.   
If someone thinks that only recluse can get Self-Realisation, a Lahiri  
Mahasaya is born.   
If someone thinks that only devotees of Siva can get God-Realisation, a  
Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is born.   
If someone thinks that only men can get God-Realisation, a Maa Anandamayi is  
born.   
If someone thinks that God cannot be realised through idol worship, a  
Ramakrisha is born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realised through idol worship, a Ramana  
Maharshi is born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realized through rituals, a Buddha is  
born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realized in India, a Jesus Christ is  
born.   
If someone thinks that only economically sound people can have realization, a  
Nisargadatta Maharaj is born.   
If someone thinks that only grown-ups can get self-realization, a Jnana  
Sambandar is born.   
If someone thinks that only learned people can get self-realization, a Sarada  
Devi is born.   
If someone thinks a learned people can never get Self-realization, a  
Shankaracharya is born.   
If someone thinks that one can get self-realisation only by satsangs of a  
personal guru, A J. Krishnamurthy is born.   
Whenever there appeared to be a limiting opinion about Universal  
Consciousness, it reappears in a form and shows that it is beyond that limit  
also.   
The Universal Consciousness is beyond all forms.   
However for devotees It is amenable to all forms.   
It is the Krishna of Krishna devotees.   
It is the Shiva of Shiva devotees.   
It is the Ramakrishna of Ramakrisha devotees.   
If is the Ramana of Ramana devotees.   
It is the Christ of Christ devotees.   
It is the Buddha of Buddha devotees.   
So Sri Ramakrisha said: "God has form and He is formless too. Further, He is beyond both form and  
formlessness. No one can limit Him."

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent.   
The universal consciousness cuts across all barriers. That is why   
it is universal, limitless, beyond names and forms. But a person   
who has realized this Advaita Siddhi sees in every form and name   
the Consciousness.   
Saint Jnana Deva, who was in and out a Panduranga (Krishna)   
bhakta had this Advaita Siddhi towards the end of his life. He   
stopped going to the temple, sat simply on the banks of Chandrbhaga river and  
whatever devotees gave him, he was   
eating. Once devotees placed a couple of roti (bread) pieces   
and some jaggery on a leaf and left. Soon a dog came and grabbed   
one roti and was running away. The devotees were aghast not   
knowing what to do? Jnana Deva ran behind the dog, caught it   
and said: O Panduranga, you have taken only the roti. How will   
you eat this dry food. Why not you take this jaggery also?   
Bhagavan Ramana once had a monkey which was stoned and beaten   
up. He used to nurse it everyday. Soon it became alright. On   
seeing the wounds healed up, He rejoiced. The same was the case   
with another dog also. Sri Arunachala Pancharatnam Verse 5: Unnaikkandu ellam unnruvai   
Anniyamil anbu seyym annon.....   
He who, with Heart to you surrendered,   
Beholds for ever you alone.   
Sees all things as forms of you   
And loves and serves them as none other   
Than the Self, O Arunachala!   
Triumphs because he is immersed   
In you whose being is pure bliss.   
Thank you, silentgreen.   
Arunachala Siva.

How can mind become Self?   
mind is mithya.   
Self is Truth.   
So one cannot become the other.   
There is really no difference between normal and universal consciousness.  
There is only one: Consciousness.   
like the space in a pot and space outside. .. we have artificially marked it  
as universal consciousness and normal consciousness.   
There is just Consciousness. what is normal consciousness is also the  
universal.

Dear srkudai,   
We begin saying that the world is unreal. It is for the purpose of   
continuing our seeking the Self. Once the Self is realized, the world   
is Real, Brahma Swarupam. Similarly, the mind is mithya, seemingly   
real on seemingly unreal for the purpose of sadhana. Once the   
self realization takes place it becomes the Brahman.   
*   
Bhagavan Ramana has said: The inherent nature of the Self is Bliss. Some kind of knowledge   
has to be admitted, even in the realization of the supreme bliss.   
It may be said to be subtler than the subtlest.   
The word Vijnana [clear knowledge] is used both to denote the realization of  
the Self and knowing the objects. The Self is wisdom. It functions in two  
ways. When associated with ego, the knowledge is objective [vijnana]. When  
divested of the ego, and the universal Self is realized, it is also called  
Vijnana. The word raises a mental concept. Therefore, we say that the Self  
realized sage knows by his mind, but his mind is pure. Again we say that by  
the vibrating mind is impure and the placid mind is pure. The pure mind is  
itself Brahman. Therefore it follows that Brahman is not other than the mind  
of the Sage.

Consciousness ever is, no doubt about it,   
its as simple as the difference between Sri Ramana Maharshi and us...   
Curds is found in Milk itself, can we drink milk thinking it as curds? there  
is difference, Milk is milk, curds is curds, though both are in essence one  
and the same.   
When there is curds, it is no more Milk.   
Thats the point

Sri Ramakrishna said: "God has form and He is formless too. Further, He is beyond both form and  
formlessness. No one can limit Him."   
No can can limit the Universal Consciousness.   
If someone thinks that only recluse can get Self-Realisation, a Lahiri  
Mahasaya is born.   
If someone thinks that only devotees of Siva can get God-Realisation, a  
Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is born.   
If someone thinks that only men can get God-Realisation, a Maa Anandamayi is  
born.   
If someone thinks that God cannot be realised through idol worship, a  
Ramakrisha is born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realised through idol worship, a Ramana  
Maharshi is born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realized through rituals, a Buddha is  
born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realized in India, a Jesus Christ is  
born.   
If someone thinks that only economically sound people can have realization, a  
Nisargadatta Maharaj is born.   
If someone thinks that only grown-ups can get self-realization, a Jnana  
Sambandar is born.   
If someone thinks that only learned people can get self-realization, a Sarada  
Devi is born.   
If someone thinks a learned people can never get Self-realization, a  
Shankaracharya is born.   
If someone thinks that one can get self-realisation only by satsangs of a  
personal guru, A J. Krishnamurthy is born.   
Whenever there appeared to be a limiting opinion about Universal  
Consciousness, it reappears in a form and shows that it is beyond that limit  
also.   
The Universal Consciousness is beyond all forms.   
However for devotees It is amenable to all forms.   
It is the Krishna of Krishna devotees.   
It is the Shiva of Shiva devotees.   
It is the Ramakrishna of Ramakrisha devotees.   
If is the Ramana of Ramana devotees.   
It is the Christ of Christ devotees.   
It is the Buddha of Buddha devotees.   
So Sri Ramakrisha said: "God has form and He is formless too. Further, He is beyond both form and  
formlessness. No one can limit Him."

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent.   
The universal consciousness cuts across all barriers. That is why   
it is universal, limitless, beyond names and forms. But a person   
who has realized this Advaita Siddhi sees in every form and name   
the Consciousness.   
Saint Jnana Deva, who was in and out a Panduranga (Krishna)   
bhakta had this Advaita Siddhi towards the end of his life. He   
stopped going to the temple, sat simply on the banks of Chandrbhaga river and  
whatever devotees gave him, he was   
eating. Once devotees placed a couple of roti (bread) pieces   
and some jaggery on a leaf and left. Soon a dog came and grabbed   
one roti and was running away. The devotees were aghast not   
knowing what to do? Jnana Deva ran behind the dog, caught it   
and said: O Panduranga, you have taken only the roti. How will   
you eat this dry food. Why not you take this jaggery also?   
Bhagavan Ramana once had a monkey which was stoned and beaten   
up. He used to nurse it everyday. Soon it became alright. On   
seeing the wounds healed up, He rejoiced. The same was the case   
with another dog also. Sri Arunachala Pancharatnam Verse 5: Unnaikkandu ellam unnruvai   
Anniyamil anbu seyym annon.....   
He who, with Heart to you surrendered,   
Beholds for ever you alone.   
Sees all things as forms of you   
And loves and serves them as none other   
Than the Self, O Arunachala!   
Triumphs because he is immersed   
In you whose being is pure bliss.   
Thank you, silentgreen.   
Arunachala Siva.

becomes Universal Consciousness or the state of   
All-knowledge.

How can mind become Self?   
mind is mithya.   
Self is Truth.   
So one cannot become the other.   
There is really no difference between normal and universal consciousness.  
There is only one: Consciousness.   
like the space in a pot and space outside. .. we have artificially marked it  
as universal consciousness and normal consciousness.   
There is just Consciousness. what is normal consciousness is also the  
universal.

Dear srkudai,   
We begin saying that the world is unreal. It is for the purpose of   
continuing our seeking the Self. Once the Self is realized, the world   
is Real, Brahma Swarupam. Similarly, the mind is mithya, seemingly   
real on seemingly unreal for the purpose of sadhana. Once the   
self realization takes place it becomes the Brahman.   
*   
Bhagavan Ramana has said: The inherent nature of the Self is Bliss. Some kind of knowledge   
has to be admitted, even in the realization of the supreme bliss.   
It may be said to be subtler than the subtlest.   
The word Vijnana [clear knowledge] is used both to denote the realization of  
the Self and knowing the objects. The Self is wisdom. It functions in two  
ways. When associated with ego, the knowledge is objective [vijnana]. When  
divested of the ego, and the universal Self is realized, it is also called  
Vijnana. The word raises a mental concept. Therefore, we say that the Self  
realized sage knows by his mind, but his mind is pure. Again we say that by  
the vibrating mind is impure and the placid mind is pure. The pure mind is  
itself Brahman. Therefore it follows that Brahman is not other than the mind  
of the Sage.   
*   
To a question as to what is meant by Jnana and Vijnana, Bhagavan Ramana has  
answered in that context: These words may mean differently according to the  
context. Jnana = Samanya Jnana or Pure Consciousness. Vijnana = Visesha  
Jnana. Visesha Jnana may be: a) wordly [relative knowledge]; and b]  
Transcendental - Self realization.   
*   
Guru Vachaka Kovai Verse 1106 states: The pure mind of a Jnani, which exists and shines as the witness, is a mirror  
that reflects even the impure thoughts that arise in his presence, in those  
whose minds are completely warped. Thus,   
he mystifies the minds of others in his presence, by giving the impression  
that he is a deluded person.   
*   
Muruganar also accepted this concept of the impure and pure mind,   
and called them as Chittarivu [small knowledge] and Perarivu [grand  
knowledge].   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian garu,   
Bhagavan Ramana says, When the indefinable power of Brahman separates itself  
from Brahman and, in union with the reflection of consciousness (Chidabhasa)  
assumes various forms, it is called the **impure mind**. When it becomes free  
from the reflection of consciousness (abhasa), through discrimination, it is  
called the **pure mind**.   
But there are no answers to questions like   
why does we assume various forms i.e have impure mind??   
how did karma started in the beginning?   
why god created the universe ??   
Where does maya come from and how did it originate?   
But when these kind of questions were asked by some devotees ramana's typical  
answer was to ask to whom these doubts arise? His typical brahmastram :-)

Dear Subramanian,   
That is not like that.   
What is mithya is asat. it cannot become SAT.   
Look at the following statements: The Post is the Ghost.   
The Ghost came from Post.   
The Ghost is unreal.   
Mind is the Ghost. Self is SAT. The Ghost does not "Become" Post. The Ghost is  
not there at all. There was always the post.   
So now, that does not mean, the "Ghost-Like" Appearance vanishes. IT  
continues; but you are not confused that it is Ghost.   
You only see Self.   
This is what Bhagavan said when he said "I have no thoughts". Not that the  
thoughts are not appearing etc. But that they are like the   
Ghost imagined on the pole. They continue to appear. .. but we know there is  
only Consciousness.   
Love!   
Silence

Where were the thoughts during sushupti?   
Why then the thoughts arise again after waking from sleep?   
As long as there is 'I' thought, so long there will be mind, thoughts.   
When the I is merged, thoughts, Mind, all are naught.   
This is the essence of Dakshinamurthy. the Universal consciousness is Pure  
without a pinch of 'I-ness' \- no mind !!   
It is simple awareness, where there is no 'I' arising,   
That is consciousness.   
When there is I thought popping out, there is mind.   
As long there is mind, there is Jagart Swapna Sushupti.   
Consciousness is beyond these three states, that implies, destruction of mind,  
which itself is I thought.   
Consciousness is (state) where there is no one who can own anymore the thought  
of consciousness. So long there is mind, there is owner to thoughts.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

so is there no consciousness when there are thoughts?   
consciousness IS.   
thoughts or no thougts. how does it matter. Infact that there is a thought  
itself is a proof that there is Consciousness.   
And infact, even now Consciousness is without thoughts. Consciousness is ever  
without thoughts: As even space is without clouds. Clouds float in space; but  
space is without clouds.   
So presence or absence of clouds is not a problem for Space.

How can mind become Self?   
mind is mithya.   
Self is Truth.   
So one cannot become the other.   
There is really no difference between normal and universal consciousness.  
There is only one: Consciousness.   
like the space in a pot and space outside. .. we have artificially marked it

There is just Consciousness. what is normal consciousness is also the

Dear srkudai,   
We begin saying that the world is unreal. It is for the purpose of   
continuing our seeking the Self. Once the Self is realized, the world   
is Real, Brahma Swarupam. Similarly, the mind is mithya, seemingly   
real on seemingly unreal for the purpose of sadhana. Once the   
self realization takes place it becomes the Brahman.   
*   
Bhagavan Ramana has said: The inherent nature of the Self is Bliss. Some kind of knowledge   
has to be admitted, even in the realization of the supreme bliss.   
It may be said to be subtler than the subtlest.   
The word Vijnana [clear knowledge] is used both to denote the realization of  
the Self and knowing the objects. The Self is wisdom. It functions in two  
ways. When associated with ego, the knowledge is objective [vijnana]. When  
divested of the ego, and the universal Self is realized, it is also called  
Vijnana. The word raises a mental concept. Therefore, we say that the Self  
realized sage knows by his mind, but his mind is pure. Again we say that by  
the vibrating mind is impure and the placid mind is pure. The pure mind is  
itself Brahman. Therefore it follows that Brahman is not other than the mind  
of the Sage.   
*   
To a question as to what is meant by Jnana and Vijnana, Bhagavan Ramana has  
answered in that context: These words may mean differently according to the  
context. Jnana = Samanya Jnana or Pure Consciousness. Vijnana = Visesha  
Jnana. Visesha Jnana may be: a) wordly [relative knowledge]; and b]  
Transcendental - Self realization.   
*   
Guru Vachaka Kovai Verse 1106 states: The pure mind of a Jnani, which exists and shines as the witness, is a mirror  
that reflects even the impure thoughts that arise in his presence, in those  
whose minds are completely warped. Thus,   
he mystifies the minds of others in his presence, by giving the impression  
that he is a deluded person.   
*   
Muruganar also accepted this concept of the impure and pure mind,   
and called them as Chittarivu [small knowledge] and Perarivu [grand  
knowledge].   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian garu,   
Bhagavan Ramana says, When the indefinable power of Brahman separates itself  
from Brahman and, in union with the reflection of consciousness (Chidabhasa)  
assumes various forms, it is called the **impure mind**. When it becomes free  
from the reflection of consciousness (abhasa), through discrimination, it is  
called the **pure mind**.   
But there are no answers to questions like   
why does we assume various forms i.e have impure mind??   
how did karma started in the beginning?   
why god created the universe ??   
Where does maya come from and how did it originate?   
But when these kind of questions were asked by some devotees ramana's typical  
answer was to ask to whom these doubts arise? His typical brahmastram :-)

Dear Subramanian,   
That is not like that.   
What is mithya is asat. it cannot become SAT.   
Look at the following statements: The Post is the Ghost.   
The Ghost came from Post.   
The Ghost is unreal.   
Mind is the Ghost. Self is SAT. The Ghost does not "Become" Post. The Ghost is  
not there at all. There was always the post.   
So now, that does not mean, the "Ghost-Like" Appearance vanishes. IT  
continues; but you are not confused that it is Ghost.   
You only see Self.   
This is what Bhagavan said when he said "I have no thoughts". Not that the  
thoughts are not appearing etc. But that they are like the   
Ghost imagined on the pole. They continue to appear. .. but we know there is  
only Consciousness.   
Love!   
Silence

Where were the thoughts during sushupti?   
Why then the thoughts arise again after waking from sleep?   
As long as there is 'I' thought, so long there will be mind, thoughts.   
When the I is merged, thoughts, Mind, all are naught.   
This is the essence of Dakshinamurthy. the Universal consciousness is Pure  
without a pinch of 'I-ness' \- no mind !!   
It is simple awareness, where there is no 'I' arising,   
That is consciousness.   
When there is I thought popping out, there is mind.   
As long there is mind, there is Jagart Swapna Sushupti.   
Consciousness is beyond these three states, that implies, destruction of mind,  
which itself is I thought.   
Consciousness is (state) where there is no one who can own anymore the thought  
of consciousness. So long there is mind, there is owner to thoughts.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

so is there no consciousness when there are thoughts?   
consciousness IS.   
thoughts or no thougts. how does it matter. Infact that there is a thought  
itself is a proof that there is Consciousness.   
And infact, even now Consciousness is without thoughts. Consciousness is ever  
without thoughts: As even space is without clouds. Clouds float in space; but  
space is without clouds.   
So presence or absence of clouds is not a problem for Space.

Consciousness ever is, no doubt about it,   
its as simple as the difference between Sri Ramana Maharshi and us...   
Curds is found in Milk itself, can we drink milk thinking it as curds? there  
is difference, Milk is milk, curds is curds, though both are in essence one  
and the same.   
When there is curds, it is no more Milk.   
Thats the point

Ramana ate food, we eat food.

Sri Ramakrishna said: "God has form and He is formless too. Further, He is beyond both form and  
formlessness. No one can limit Him."   
No can can limit the Universal Consciousness.   
If someone thinks that only recluse can get Self-Realisation, a Lahiri  
Mahasaya is born.   
If someone thinks that only devotees of Siva can get God-Realisation, a  
Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is born.   
If someone thinks that only men can get God-Realisation, a Maa Anandamayi is  
born.   
If someone thinks that God cannot be realised through idol worship, a  
Ramakrisha is born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realised through idol worship, a Ramana  
Maharshi is born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realized through rituals, a Buddha is  
born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realized in India, a Jesus Christ is  
born.   
If someone thinks that only economically sound people can have realization, a  
Nisargadatta Maharaj is born.   
If someone thinks that only grown-ups can get self-realization, a Jnana  
Sambandar is born.   
If someone thinks that only learned people can get self-realization, a Sarada  
Devi is born.   
If someone thinks a learned people can never get Self-realization, a  
Shankaracharya is born.   
If someone thinks that one can get self-realisation only by satsangs of a  
personal guru, A J. Krishnamurthy is born.   
Whenever there appeared to be a limiting opinion about Universal  
Consciousness, it reappears in a form and shows that it is beyond that limit  
also.   
The Universal Consciousness is beyond all forms.   
However for devotees It is amenable to all forms.   
It is the Krishna of Krishna devotees.   
It is the Shiva of Shiva devotees.   
It is the Ramakrishna of Ramakrisha devotees.   
If is the Ramana of Ramana devotees.   
It is the Christ of Christ devotees.   
It is the Buddha of Buddha devotees.   
So Sri Ramakrisha said: "God has form and He is formless too. Further, He is beyond both form and  
formlessness. No one can limit Him."

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent.   
The universal consciousness cuts across all barriers. That is why   
it is universal, limitless, beyond names and forms. But a person   
who has realized this Advaita Siddhi sees in every form and name   
the Consciousness.   
Saint Jnana Deva, who was in and out a Panduranga (Krishna)   
bhakta had this Advaita Siddhi towards the end of his life. He   
stopped going to the temple, sat simply on the banks of Chandrbhaga river and  
whatever devotees gave him, he was   
eating. Once devotees placed a couple of roti (bread) pieces   
and some jaggery on a leaf and left. Soon a dog came and grabbed   
one roti and was running away. The devotees were aghast not   
knowing what to do? Jnana Deva ran behind the dog, caught it   
and said: O Panduranga, you have taken only the roti. How will   
you eat this dry food. Why not you take this jaggery also?   
Bhagavan Ramana once had a monkey which was stoned and beaten   
up. He used to nurse it everyday. Soon it became alright. On   
seeing the wounds healed up, He rejoiced. The same was the case   
with another dog also. Sri Arunachala Pancharatnam Verse 5: Unnaikkandu ellam unnruvai   
Anniyamil anbu seyym annon.....   
He who, with Heart to you surrendered,   
Beholds for ever you alone.   
Sees all things as forms of you   
And loves and serves them as none other   
Than the Self, O Arunachala!   
Triumphs because he is immersed   
In you whose being is pure bliss.   
Thank you, silentgreen.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
That is not like that.   
What is mithya is asat. it cannot become SAT.   
Look at the following statements: The Post is the Ghost.   
The Ghost came from Post.   
The Ghost is unreal.   
Mind is the Ghost. Self is SAT. The Ghost does not "Become" Post. The Ghost is  
not there at all. There was always the post.   
So now, that does not mean, the "Ghost-Like" Appearance vanishes. IT  
continues; but you are not confused that it is Ghost.   
You only see Self.   
This is what Bhagavan said when he said "I have no thoughts". Not that the  
thoughts are not appearing etc. But that they are like the   
Ghost imagined on the pole. They continue to appear. .. but we know there is  
only Consciousness.   
Love!   
Silence

Where were the thoughts during sushupti?   
Why then the thoughts arise again after waking from sleep?   
As long as there is 'I' thought, so long there will be mind, thoughts.   
When the I is merged, thoughts, Mind, all are naught.   
This is the essence of Dakshinamurthy. the Universal consciousness is Pure  
without a pinch of 'I-ness' \- no mind !!   
It is simple awareness, where there is no 'I' arising,   
That is consciousness.   
When there is I thought popping out, there is mind.   
As long there is mind, there is Jagart Swapna Sushupti.   
Consciousness is beyond these three states, that implies, destruction of mind,  
which itself is I thought.   
Consciousness is (state) where there is no one who can own anymore the thought  
of consciousness. So long there is mind, there is owner to thoughts.

And infact, even now Consciousness is without thoughts. Consciousness is ever

Sri Ramakrishna said: "God has form and He is formless too. Further, He is beyond both form and  
formlessness. No one can limit Him."   
No can can limit the Universal Consciousness.   
If someone thinks that only recluse can get Self-Realisation, a Lahiri  
Mahasaya is born.   
If someone thinks that only devotees of Siva can get God-Realisation, a  
Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is born.   
If someone thinks that only men can get God-Realisation, a Maa Anandamayi is  
born.   
If someone thinks that God cannot be realised through idol worship, a  
Ramakrisha is born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realised through idol worship, a Ramana  
Maharshi is born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realized through rituals, a Buddha is  
born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realized in India, a Jesus Christ is  
born.   
If someone thinks that only economically sound people can have realization, a  
Nisargadatta Maharaj is born.   
If someone thinks that only grown-ups can get self-realization, a Jnana  
Sambandar is born.   
If someone thinks that only learned people can get self-realization, a Sarada  
Devi is born.   
If someone thinks a learned people can never get Self-realization, a  
Shankaracharya is born.   
If someone thinks that one can get self-realisation only by satsangs of a  
personal guru, A J. Krishnamurthy is born.   
Whenever there appeared to be a limiting opinion about Universal  
Consciousness, it reappears in a form and shows that it is beyond that limit  
also.   
The Universal Consciousness is beyond all forms.   
However for devotees It is amenable to all forms.   
It is the Krishna of Krishna devotees.   
It is the Shiva of Shiva devotees.   
It is the Ramakrishna of Ramakrisha devotees.   
If is the Ramana of Ramana devotees.   
It is the Christ of Christ devotees.   
It is the Buddha of Buddha devotees.   
So Sri Ramakrisha said: "God has form and He is formless too. Further, He is beyond both form and  
formlessness. No one can limit Him."

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent.   
The universal consciousness cuts across all barriers. That is why   
it is universal, limitless, beyond names and forms. But a person   
who has realized this Advaita Siddhi sees in every form and name   
the Consciousness.   
Saint Jnana Deva, who was in and out a Panduranga (Krishna)   
bhakta had this Advaita Siddhi towards the end of his life. He   
stopped going to the temple, sat simply on the banks of Chandrbhaga river and  
whatever devotees gave him, he was   
eating. Once devotees placed a couple of roti (bread) pieces   
and some jaggery on a leaf and left. Soon a dog came and grabbed   
one roti and was running away. The devotees were aghast not   
knowing what to do? Jnana Deva ran behind the dog, caught it   
and said: O Panduranga, you have taken only the roti. How will   
you eat this dry food. Why not you take this jaggery also?   
Bhagavan Ramana once had a monkey which was stoned and beaten   
up. He used to nurse it everyday. Soon it became alright. On   
seeing the wounds healed up, He rejoiced. The same was the case   
with another dog also. Sri Arunachala Pancharatnam Verse 5: Unnaikkandu ellam unnruvai   
Anniyamil anbu seyym annon.....   
He who, with Heart to you surrendered,   
Beholds for ever you alone.   
Sees all things as forms of you   
And loves and serves them as none other   
Than the Self, O Arunachala!   
Triumphs because he is immersed   
In you whose being is pure bliss.   
Thank you, silentgreen.   
Arunachala Siva.

How can mind become Self?   
mind is mithya.   
Self is Truth.   
So one cannot become the other.   
There is really no difference between normal and universal consciousness.  
There is only one: Consciousness.   
like the space in a pot and space outside. .. we have artificially marked it  
as universal consciousness and normal consciousness.   
There is just Consciousness. what is normal consciousness is also the  
universal.

Dear srkudai,   
We begin saying that the world is unreal. It is for the purpose of   
continuing our seeking the Self. Once the Self is realized, the world   
is Real, Brahma Swarupam. Similarly, the mind is mithya, seemingly   
real on seemingly unreal for the purpose of sadhana. Once the   
self realization takes place it becomes the Brahman.   
*   
Bhagavan Ramana has said: The inherent nature of the Self is Bliss. Some kind of knowledge   
has to be admitted, even in the realization of the supreme bliss.   
It may be said to be subtler than the subtlest.   
The word Vijnana [clear knowledge] is used both to denote the realization of  
the Self and knowing the objects. The Self is wisdom. It functions in two  
ways. When associated with ego, the knowledge is objective [vijnana]. When  
divested of the ego, and the universal Self is realized, it is also called  
Vijnana. The word raises a mental concept. Therefore, we say that the Self  
realized sage knows by his mind, but his mind is pure. Again we say that by  
the vibrating mind is impure and the placid mind is pure. The pure mind is  
itself Brahman. Therefore it follows that Brahman is not other than the mind  
of the Sage.   
*   
To a question as to what is meant by Jnana and Vijnana, Bhagavan Ramana has  
answered in that context: These words may mean differently according to the  
context. Jnana = Samanya Jnana or Pure Consciousness. Vijnana = Visesha  
Jnana. Visesha Jnana may be: a) wordly [relative knowledge]; and b]  
Transcendental - Self realization.   
*   
Guru Vachaka Kovai Verse 1106 states: The pure mind of a Jnani, which exists and shines as the witness, is a mirror  
that reflects even the impure thoughts that arise in his presence, in those  
whose minds are completely warped. Thus,   
he mystifies the minds of others in his presence, by giving the impression  
that he is a deluded person.   
*   
Muruganar also accepted this concept of the impure and pure mind,   
and called them as Chittarivu [small knowledge] and Perarivu [grand  
knowledge].   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian garu,   
Bhagavan Ramana says, When the indefinable power of Brahman separates itself  
from Brahman and, in union with the reflection of consciousness (Chidabhasa)  
assumes various forms, it is called the **impure mind**. When it becomes free  
from the reflection of consciousness (abhasa), through discrimination, it is  
called the **pure mind**.   
But there are no answers to questions like   
why does we assume various forms i.e have impure mind??   
how did karma started in the beginning?   
why god created the universe ??   
Where does maya come from and how did it originate?   
But when these kind of questions were asked by some devotees ramana's typical

Sri Ramakrishna said: "God has form and He is formless too. Further, He is beyond both form and  
formlessness. No one can limit Him."   
No can can limit the Universal Consciousness.   
If someone thinks that only recluse can get Self-Realisation, a Lahiri  
Mahasaya is born.   
If someone thinks that only devotees of Siva can get God-Realisation, a  
Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is born.   
If someone thinks that only men can get God-Realisation, a Maa Anandamayi is  
born.   
If someone thinks that God cannot be realised through idol worship, a  
Ramakrisha is born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realised through idol worship, a Ramana  
Maharshi is born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realized through rituals, a Buddha is  
born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realized in India, a Jesus Christ is  
born.   
If someone thinks that only economically sound people can have realization, a  
Nisargadatta Maharaj is born.   
If someone thinks that only grown-ups can get self-realization, a Jnana  
Sambandar is born.   
If someone thinks that only learned people can get self-realization, a Sarada  
Devi is born.   
If someone thinks a learned people can never get Self-realization, a  
Shankaracharya is born.   
If someone thinks that one can get self-realisation only by satsangs of a  
personal guru, A J. Krishnamurthy is born.   
Whenever there appeared to be a limiting opinion about Universal  
Consciousness, it reappears in a form and shows that it is beyond that limit  
also.   
The Universal Consciousness is beyond all forms.   
However for devotees It is amenable to all forms.   
It is the Krishna of Krishna devotees.   
It is the Shiva of Shiva devotees.   
It is the Ramakrishna of Ramakrisha devotees.   
If is the Ramana of Ramana devotees.   
It is the Christ of Christ devotees.   
It is the Buddha of Buddha devotees.   
So Sri Ramakrisha said: "God has form and He is formless too. Further, He is beyond both form and  
formlessness. No one can limit Him."

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent.   
The universal consciousness cuts across all barriers. That is why   
it is universal, limitless, beyond names and forms. But a person   
who has realized this Advaita Siddhi sees in every form and name   
the Consciousness.   
Saint Jnana Deva, who was in and out a Panduranga (Krishna)   
bhakta had this Advaita Siddhi towards the end of his life. He   
stopped going to the temple, sat simply on the banks of Chandrbhaga river and  
whatever devotees gave him, he was   
eating. Once devotees placed a couple of roti (bread) pieces   
and some jaggery on a leaf and left. Soon a dog came and grabbed   
one roti and was running away. The devotees were aghast not   
knowing what to do? Jnana Deva ran behind the dog, caught it   
and said: O Panduranga, you have taken only the roti. How will   
you eat this dry food. Why not you take this jaggery also?   
Bhagavan Ramana once had a monkey which was stoned and beaten   
up. He used to nurse it everyday. Soon it became alright. On   
seeing the wounds healed up, He rejoiced. The same was the case   
with another dog also. Sri Arunachala Pancharatnam Verse 5: Unnaikkandu ellam unnruvai   
Anniyamil anbu seyym annon.....   
He who, with Heart to you surrendered,   
Beholds for ever you alone.   
Sees all things as forms of you   
And loves and serves them as none other   
Than the Self, O Arunachala!   
Triumphs because he is immersed   
In you whose being is pure bliss.   
Thank you, silentgreen.   
Arunachala Siva.

How can mind become Self?   
mind is mithya.   
Self is Truth.   
So one cannot become the other.   
There is really no difference between normal and universal consciousness.  
There is only one: Consciousness.   
like the space in a pot and space outside. .. we have artificially marked it  
as universal consciousness and normal consciousness.   
There is just Consciousness. what is normal consciousness is also the  
universal.

Dear srkudai,   
We begin saying that the world is unreal. It is for the purpose of   
continuing our seeking the Self. Once the Self is realized, the world   
is Real, Brahma Swarupam. Similarly, the mind is mithya, seemingly   
real on seemingly unreal for the purpose of sadhana. Once the   
self realization takes place it becomes the Brahman.   
*   
Bhagavan Ramana has said: The inherent nature of the Self is Bliss. Some kind of knowledge   
has to be admitted, even in the realization of the supreme bliss.   
It may be said to be subtler than the subtlest.   
The word Vijnana [clear knowledge] is used both to denote the realization of  
the Self and knowing the objects. The Self is wisdom. It functions in two  
ways. When associated with ego, the knowledge is objective [vijnana]. When  
divested of the ego, and the universal Self is realized, it is also called  
Vijnana. The word raises a mental concept. Therefore, we say that the Self  
realized sage knows by his mind, but his mind is pure. Again we say that by  
the vibrating mind is impure and the placid mind is pure. The pure mind is  
itself Brahman. Therefore it follows that Brahman is not other than the mind  
of the Sage.   
*   
To a question as to what is meant by Jnana and Vijnana, Bhagavan Ramana has  
answered in that context: These words may mean differently according to the  
context. Jnana = Samanya Jnana or Pure Consciousness. Vijnana = Visesha  
Jnana. Visesha Jnana may be: a) wordly [relative knowledge]; and b]  
Transcendental - Self realization.   
*   
Guru Vachaka Kovai Verse 1106 states: The pure mind of a Jnani, which exists and shines as the witness, is a mirror  
that reflects even the impure thoughts that arise in his presence, in those  
whose minds are completely warped. Thus,   
he mystifies the minds of others in his presence, by giving the impression  
that he is a deluded person.   
*   
Muruganar also accepted this concept of the impure and pure mind,   
and called them as Chittarivu [small knowledge] and Perarivu [grand  
knowledge].   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian garu,   
Bhagavan Ramana says, When the indefinable power of Brahman separates itself  
from Brahman and, in union with the reflection of consciousness (Chidabhasa)  
assumes various forms, it is called the **impure mind**. When it becomes free  
from the reflection of consciousness (abhasa), through discrimination, it is  
called the **pure mind**.   
But there are no answers to questions like   
why does we assume various forms i.e have impure mind??   
how did karma started in the beginning?   
why god created the universe ??   
Where does maya come from and how did it originate?   
But when these kind of questions were asked by some devotees ramana's typical  
answer was to ask to whom these doubts arise? His typical brahmastram :-)

Dear Subramanian,   
That is not like that.   
What is mithya is asat. it cannot become SAT.   
Look at the following statements: The Post is the Ghost.   
The Ghost came from Post.   
The Ghost is unreal.   
Mind is the Ghost. Self is SAT. The Ghost does not "Become" Post. The Ghost is  
not there at all. There was always the post.   
So now, that does not mean, the "Ghost-Like" Appearance vanishes. IT  
continues; but you are not confused that it is Ghost.   
You only see Self.   
This is what Bhagavan said when he said "I have no thoughts". Not that the  
thoughts are not appearing etc. But that they are like the   
Ghost imagined on the pole. They continue to appear. .. but we know there is  
only Consciousness.   
Love!   
Silence

Where were the thoughts during sushupti?   
Why then the thoughts arise again after waking from sleep?   
As long as there is 'I' thought, so long there will be mind, thoughts.   
When the I is merged, thoughts, Mind, all are naught.   
This is the essence of Dakshinamurthy. the Universal consciousness is Pure  
without a pinch of 'I-ness' \- no mind !!   
It is simple awareness, where there is no 'I' arising,   
That is consciousness.   
When there is I thought popping out, there is mind.   
As long there is mind, there is Jagart Swapna Sushupti.   
Consciousness is beyond these three states, that implies, destruction of mind,  
which itself is I thought.   
Consciousness is (state) where there is no one who can own anymore the thought  
of consciousness. So long there is mind, there is owner to thoughts.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

so is there no consciousness when there are thoughts?   
consciousness IS.   
thoughts or no thougts. how does it matter. Infact that there is a thought  
itself is a proof that there is Consciousness.   
And infact, even now Consciousness is without thoughts. Consciousness is ever  
without thoughts: As even space is without clouds. Clouds float in space; but  
space is without clouds.   
So presence or absence of clouds is not a problem for Space.

Consciousness ever is, no doubt about it,   
its as simple as the difference between Sri Ramana Maharshi and us...   
Curds is found in Milk itself, can we drink milk thinking it as curds? there  
is difference, Milk is milk, curds is curds, though both are in essence one  
and the same.   
When there is curds, it is no more Milk.   
Thats the point

Ramana ate food, we eat food.

How can mind become Self?   
mind is mithya.   
Self is Truth.   
So one cannot become the other.   
There is really no difference between normal and universal consciousness.  
There is only one: Consciousness.   
like the space in a pot and space outside. .. we have artificially marked it  
as universal consciousness and normal consciousness.   
There is just Consciousness. what is normal consciousness is also the  
universal.

Dear srkudai,   
We begin saying that the world is unreal. It is for the purpose of   
continuing our seeking the Self. Once the Self is realized, the world   
is Real, Brahma Swarupam. Similarly, the mind is mithya, seemingly   
real on seemingly unreal for the purpose of sadhana. Once the   
self realization takes place it becomes the Brahman.   
*   
Bhagavan Ramana has said: The inherent nature of the Self is Bliss. Some kind of knowledge   
has to be admitted, even in the realization of the supreme bliss.   
It may be said to be subtler than the subtlest.   
The word Vijnana [clear knowledge] is used both to denote the realization of  
the Self and knowing the objects. The Self is wisdom. It functions in two  
ways. When associated with ego, the knowledge is objective [vijnana]. When  
divested of the ego, and the universal Self is realized, it is also called  
Vijnana. The word raises a mental concept. Therefore, we say that the Self  
realized sage knows by his mind, but his mind is pure. Again we say that by  
the vibrating mind is impure and the placid mind is pure. The pure mind is  
itself Brahman. Therefore it follows that Brahman is not other than the mind  
of the Sage.   
*   
To a question as to what is meant by Jnana and Vijnana, Bhagavan Ramana has  
answered in that context: These words may mean differently according to the  
context. Jnana = Samanya Jnana or Pure Consciousness. Vijnana = Visesha  
Jnana. Visesha Jnana may be: a) wordly [relative knowledge]; and b]  
Transcendental - Self realization.   
*   
Guru Vachaka Kovai Verse 1106 states: The pure mind of a Jnani, which exists and shines as the witness, is a mirror  
that reflects even the impure thoughts that arise in his presence, in those  
whose minds are completely warped. Thus,   
he mystifies the minds of others in his presence, by giving the impression  
that he is a deluded person.   
*   
Muruganar also accepted this concept of the impure and pure mind,   
and called them as Chittarivu [small knowledge] and Perarivu [grand  
knowledge].   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian garu,   
Bhagavan Ramana says, When the indefinable power of Brahman separates itself  
from Brahman and, in union with the reflection of consciousness (Chidabhasa)  
assumes various forms, it is called the **impure mind**. When it becomes free  
from the reflection of consciousness (abhasa), through discrimination, it is  
called the **pure mind**.   
But there are no answers to questions like   
why does we assume various forms i.e have impure mind??   
how did karma started in the beginning?   
why god created the universe ??   
Where does maya come from and how did it originate?   
But when these kind of questions were asked by some devotees ramana's typical  
answer was to ask to whom these doubts arise? His typical brahmastram :-)

Dear Subramanian,   
That is not like that.   
What is mithya is asat. it cannot become SAT.   
Look at the following statements: The Post is the Ghost.   
The Ghost came from Post.   
The Ghost is unreal.   
Mind is the Ghost. Self is SAT. The Ghost does not "Become" Post. The Ghost is  
not there at all. There was always the post.   
So now, that does not mean, the "Ghost-Like" Appearance vanishes. IT  
continues; but you are not confused that it is Ghost.   
You only see Self.   
This is what Bhagavan said when he said "I have no thoughts". Not that the  
thoughts are not appearing etc. But that they are like the   
Ghost imagined on the pole. They continue to appear. .. but we know there is  
only Consciousness.   
Love!

Where were the thoughts during sushupti?   
Why then the thoughts arise again after waking from sleep?   
As long as there is 'I' thought, so long there will be mind, thoughts.   
When the I is merged, thoughts, Mind, all are naught.   
This is the essence of Dakshinamurthy. the Universal consciousness is Pure  
without a pinch of 'I-ness' \- no mind !!   
It is simple awareness, where there is no 'I' arising,   
That is consciousness.   
When there is I thought popping out, there is mind.   
As long there is mind, there is Jagart Swapna Sushupti.   
Consciousness is beyond these three states, that implies, destruction of mind,  
which itself is I thought.   
Consciousness is (state) where there is no one who can own anymore the thought  
of consciousness. So long there is mind, there is owner to thoughts.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

so is there no consciousness when there are thoughts?   
consciousness IS.   
thoughts or no thougts. how does it matter. Infact that there is a thought  
itself is a proof that there is Consciousness.   
And infact, even now Consciousness is without thoughts. Consciousness is ever  
without thoughts: As even space is without clouds. Clouds float in space; but  
space is without clouds.   
So presence or absence of clouds is not a problem for Space.

Consciousness ever is, no doubt about it,   
its as simple as the difference between Sri Ramana Maharshi and us...   
Curds is found in Milk itself, can we drink milk thinking it as curds? there  
is difference, Milk is milk, curds is curds, though both are in essence one  
and the same.   
When there is curds, it is no more Milk.   
Thats the point

## Universal Consciousness: Beyond all limitations  
Author: silentgreen         Date: November 27, 2009, 12:16:42 PM

Sri Ramakrishna said: "God has form and He is formless too. Further, He is beyond both form and  
formlessness. No one can limit Him."   
No can can limit the Universal Consciousness.   
If someone thinks that only recluse can get Self-Realisation, a Lahiri  
Mahasaya is born.   
If someone thinks that only devotees of Siva can get God-Realisation, a  
Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is born.   
If someone thinks that only men can get God-Realisation, a Maa Anandamayi is  
born.   
If someone thinks that God cannot be realised through idol worship, a  
Ramakrisha is born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realised through idol worship, a Ramana  
Maharshi is born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realized through rituals, a Buddha is  
born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realized in India, a Jesus Christ is  
born.   
If someone thinks that only economically sound people can have realization, a  
Nisargadatta Maharaj is born.   
If someone thinks that only grown-ups can get self-realization, a Jnana  
Sambandar is born.   
If someone thinks that only learned people can get self-realization, a Sarada  
Devi is born.   
If someone thinks a learned people can never get Self-realization, a  
Shankaracharya is born.   
If someone thinks that one can get self-realisation only by satsangs of a  
personal guru, A J. Krishnamurthy is born.   
Whenever there appeared to be a limiting opinion about Universal  
Consciousness, it reappears in a form and shows that it is beyond that limit  
also.   
The Universal Consciousness is beyond all forms.   
However for devotees It is amenable to all forms.   
It is the Krishna of Krishna devotees.   
It is the Shiva of Shiva devotees.   
It is the Ramakrishna of Ramakrisha devotees.   
If is the Ramana of Ramana devotees.   
It is the Christ of Christ devotees.   
It is the Buddha of Buddha devotees.   
So Sri Ramakrisha said: "God has form and He is formless too. Further, He is beyond both form and  
formlessness. No one can limit Him."

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent.   
The universal consciousness cuts across all barriers. That is why   
it is universal, limitless, beyond names and forms. But a person   
who has realized this Advaita Siddhi sees in every form and name   
the Consciousness.   
Saint Jnana Deva, who was in and out a Panduranga (Krishna)   
bhakta had this Advaita Siddhi towards the end of his life. He   
stopped going to the temple, sat simply on the banks of Chandrbhaga river and  
whatever devotees gave him, he was   
eating. Once devotees placed a couple of roti (bread) pieces   
and some jaggery on a leaf and left. Soon a dog came and grabbed   
one roti and was running away. The devotees were aghast not   
knowing what to do? Jnana Deva ran behind the dog, caught it   
and said: O Panduranga, you have taken only the roti. How will   
you eat this dry food. Why not you take this jaggery also?   
Bhagavan Ramana once had a monkey which was stoned and beaten   
up. He used to nurse it everyday. Soon it became alright. On   
seeing the wounds healed up, He rejoiced. The same was the case   
with another dog also. Sri Arunachala Pancharatnam Verse 5: Unnaikkandu ellam unnruvai   
Anniyamil anbu seyym annon.....   
He who, with Heart to you surrendered,   
Beholds for ever you alone.   
Sees all things as forms of you   
And loves and serves them as none other   
Than the Self, O Arunachala!   
Triumphs because he is immersed   
In you whose being is pure bliss.   
Thank you, silentgreen.   
Arunachala Siva.

Where were the thoughts during sushupti?   
Why then the thoughts arise again after waking from sleep?   
As long as there is 'I' thought, so long there will be mind, thoughts.   
When the I is merged, thoughts, Mind, all are naught.   
This is the essence of Dakshinamurthy. the Universal consciousness is Pure  
without a pinch of 'I-ness' \- no mind !!   
It is simple awareness, where there is no 'I' arising,   
That is consciousness.   
When there is I thought popping out, there is mind.   
As long there is mind, there is Jagart Swapna Sushupti.   
Consciousness is beyond these three states, that implies, destruction of mind,  
which itself is I thought.   
Consciousness is (state) where there is no one who can own anymore the thought  
of consciousness. So long there is mind, there is owner to thoughts.

so is there no consciousness when there are thoughts?   
consciousness IS.   
thoughts or no thougts. how does it matter. Infact that there is a thought  
itself is a proof that there is Consciousness.   
And infact, even now Consciousness is without thoughts. Consciousness is ever  
without thoughts: As even space is without clouds. Clouds float in space; but  
space is without clouds.   
So presence or absence of clouds is not a problem for Space.

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent.   
The universal consciousness cuts across all barriers. That is why   
it is universal, limitless, beyond names and forms. But a person   
who has realized this Advaita Siddhi sees in every form and name   
the Consciousness.   
Saint Jnana Deva, who was in and out a Panduranga (Krishna)   
bhakta had this Advaita Siddhi towards the end of his life. He   
stopped going to the temple, sat simply on the banks of Chandrbhaga river and  
whatever devotees gave him, he was   
eating. Once devotees placed a couple of roti (bread) pieces   
and some jaggery on a leaf and left. Soon a dog came and grabbed   
one roti and was running away. The devotees were aghast not   
knowing what to do? Jnana Deva ran behind the dog, caught it   
and said: O Panduranga, you have taken only the roti. How will   
you eat this dry food. Why not you take this jaggery also?   
Bhagavan Ramana once had a monkey which was stoned and beaten   
up. He used to nurse it everyday. Soon it became alright. On   
seeing the wounds healed up, He rejoiced. The same was the case   
with another dog also. Sri Arunachala Pancharatnam Verse 5: Unnaikkandu ellam unnruvai   
Anniyamil anbu seyym annon.....   
He who, with Heart to you surrendered,   
Beholds for ever you alone.   
Sees all things as forms of you   
And loves and serves them as none other   
Than the Self, O Arunachala!   
Triumphs because he is immersed   
In you whose being is pure bliss.   
Thank you, silentgreen.   
Arunachala Siva.

How can mind become Self?   
mind is mithya.   
Self is Truth.   
So one cannot become the other.   
There is really no difference between normal and universal consciousness.  
There is only one: Consciousness.   
like the space in a pot and space outside. .. we have artificially marked it  
as universal consciousness and normal consciousness.   
There is just Consciousness. what is normal consciousness is also the  
universal.

Dear srkudai,   
We begin saying that the world is unreal. It is for the purpose of   
continuing our seeking the Self. Once the Self is realized, the world   
is Real, Brahma Swarupam. Similarly, the mind is mithya, seemingly   
real on seemingly unreal for the purpose of sadhana. Once the   
self realization takes place it becomes the Brahman.   
*   
Bhagavan Ramana has said: The inherent nature of the Self is Bliss. Some kind of knowledge   
has to be admitted, even in the realization of the supreme bliss.   
It may be said to be subtler than the subtlest.   
The word Vijnana [clear knowledge] is used both to denote the realization of  
the Self and knowing the objects. The Self is wisdom. It functions in two  
ways. When associated with ego, the knowledge is objective [vijnana]. When  
divested of the ego, and the universal Self is realized, it is also called  
Vijnana. The word raises a mental concept. Therefore, we say that the Self  
realized sage knows by his mind, but his mind is pure. Again we say that by  
the vibrating mind is impure and the placid mind is pure. The pure mind is  
itself Brahman. Therefore it follows that Brahman is not other than the mind  
of the Sage.   
*   
To a question as to what is meant by Jnana and Vijnana, Bhagavan Ramana has  
answered in that context: These words may mean differently according to the  
context. Jnana = Samanya Jnana or Pure Consciousness. Vijnana = Visesha  
Jnana. Visesha Jnana may be: a) wordly [relative knowledge]; and b]  
Transcendental - Self realization.   
*   
Guru Vachaka Kovai Verse 1106 states: The pure mind of a Jnani, which exists and shines as the witness, is a mirror  
that reflects even the impure thoughts that arise in his presence, in those  
whose minds are completely warped. Thus,   
he mystifies the minds of others in his presence, by giving the impression  
that he is a deluded person.   
*   
Muruganar also accepted this concept of the impure and pure mind,   
and called them as Chittarivu [small knowledge] and Perarivu [grand  
knowledge].   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian garu,   
Bhagavan Ramana says, When the indefinable power of Brahman separates itself  
from Brahman and, in union with the reflection of consciousness (Chidabhasa)  
assumes various forms, it is called the **impure mind**. When it becomes free  
from the reflection of consciousness (abhasa), through discrimination, it is  
called the **pure mind**.   
But there are no answers to questions like   
why does we assume various forms i.e have impure mind??   
how did karma started in the beginning?   
why god created the universe ??   
Where does maya come from and how did it originate?   
But when these kind of questions were asked by some devotees ramana's typical  
answer was to ask to whom these doubts arise? His typical brahmastram :-)

Dear Subramanian,   
That is not like that.   
What is mithya is asat. it cannot become SAT.   
Look at the following statements: The Post is the Ghost.   
The Ghost came from Post.   
The Ghost is unreal.   
Mind is the Ghost. Self is SAT. The Ghost does not "Become" Post. The Ghost is  
not there at all. There was always the post.   
So now, that does not mean, the "Ghost-Like" Appearance vanishes. IT  
continues; but you are not confused that it is Ghost.   
You only see Self.   
This is what Bhagavan said when he said "I have no thoughts". Not that the  
thoughts are not appearing etc. But that they are like the   
Ghost imagined on the pole. They continue to appear. .. but we know there is  
only Consciousness.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent.   
The universal consciousness cuts across all barriers. That is why   
it is universal, limitless, beyond names and forms. But a person   
who has realized this Advaita Siddhi sees in every form and name   
the Consciousness.   
Saint Jnana Deva, who was in and out a Panduranga (Krishna)   
bhakta had this Advaita Siddhi towards the end of his life. He   
stopped going to the temple, sat simply on the banks of Chandrbhaga river and  
whatever devotees gave him, he was   
eating. Once devotees placed a couple of roti (bread) pieces   
and some jaggery on a leaf and left. Soon a dog came and grabbed   
one roti and was running away. The devotees were aghast not   
knowing what to do? Jnana Deva ran behind the dog, caught it   
and said: O Panduranga, you have taken only the roti. How will   
you eat this dry food. Why not you take this jaggery also?   
Bhagavan Ramana once had a monkey which was stoned and beaten   
up. He used to nurse it everyday. Soon it became alright. On   
seeing the wounds healed up, He rejoiced. The same was the case   
with another dog also. Sri Arunachala Pancharatnam Verse 5: Unnaikkandu ellam unnruvai   
Anniyamil anbu seyym annon.....   
He who, with Heart to you surrendered,   
Beholds for ever you alone.   
Sees all things as forms of you   
And loves and serves them as none other   
Than the Self, O Arunachala!   
Triumphs because he is immersed   
In you whose being is pure bliss.   
Thank you, silentgreen.   
Arunachala Siva.

So one cannot become the other.   
There is really no difference between normal and universal consciousness.  
There is only one: Consciousness.

Dear srkudai,   
We begin saying that the world is unreal. It is for the purpose of   
continuing our seeking the Self. Once the Self is realized, the world   
is Real, Brahma Swarupam. Similarly, the mind is mithya, seemingly   
real on seemingly unreal for the purpose of sadhana. Once the   
self realization takes place it becomes the Brahman.   
*   
Bhagavan Ramana has said: The inherent nature of the Self is Bliss. Some kind of knowledge   
has to be admitted, even in the realization of the supreme bliss.   
It may be said to be subtler than the subtlest.   
The word Vijnana [clear knowledge] is used both to denote the realization of  
the Self and knowing the objects. The Self is wisdom. It functions in two  
ways. When associated with ego, the knowledge is objective [vijnana]. When  
divested of the ego, and the universal Self is realized, it is also called  
Vijnana. The word raises a mental concept. Therefore, we say that the Self  
realized sage knows by his mind, but his mind is pure. Again we say that by  
the vibrating mind is impure and the placid mind is pure. The pure mind is  
itself Brahman. Therefore it follows that Brahman is not other than the mind  
of the Sage.   
*   
To a question as to what is meant by Jnana and Vijnana, Bhagavan Ramana has  
answered in that context: These words may mean differently according to the  
context. Jnana = Samanya Jnana or Pure Consciousness. Vijnana = Visesha  
Jnana. Visesha Jnana may be: a) wordly [relative knowledge]; and b]  
Transcendental - Self realization.   
*   
Guru Vachaka Kovai Verse 1106 states: The pure mind of a Jnani, which exists and shines as the witness, is a mirror  
that reflects even the impure thoughts that arise in his presence, in those  
whose minds are completely warped. Thus,   
he mystifies the minds of others in his presence, by giving the impression  
that he is a deluded person.   
*   
Muruganar also accepted this concept of the impure and pure mind,   
and called them as Chittarivu [small knowledge] and Perarivu [grand  
knowledge].   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian garu,   
Bhagavan Ramana says, When the indefinable power of Brahman separates itself  
from Brahman and, in union with the reflection of consciousness (Chidabhasa)  
assumes various forms, it is called the **impure mind**. When it becomes free  
from the reflection of consciousness (abhasa), through discrimination, it is  
called the **pure mind**.   
But there are no answers to questions like   
why does we assume various forms i.e have impure mind??   
how did karma started in the beginning?   
why god created the universe ??   
Where does maya come from and how did it originate?   
But when these kind of questions were asked by some devotees ramana's typical  
answer was to ask to whom these doubts arise? His typical brahmastram :-)

Dear Subramanian,   
That is not like that.   
What is mithya is asat. it cannot become SAT.   
Look at the following statements: The Post is the Ghost.   
The Ghost came from Post.   
The Ghost is unreal.   
Mind is the Ghost. Self is SAT. The Ghost does not "Become" Post. The Ghost is  
not there at all. There was always the post.   
So now, that does not mean, the "Ghost-Like" Appearance vanishes. IT  
continues; but you are not confused that it is Ghost.   
You only see Self.   
This is what Bhagavan said when he said "I have no thoughts". Not that the  
thoughts are not appearing etc. But that they are like the   
Ghost imagined on the pole. They continue to appear. .. but we know there is  
only Consciousness.   
Love!   
Silence

Where were the thoughts during sushupti?   
Why then the thoughts arise again after waking from sleep?   
As long as there is 'I' thought, so long there will be mind, thoughts.   
When the I is merged, thoughts, Mind, all are naught.   
This is the essence of Dakshinamurthy. the Universal consciousness is Pure  
without a pinch of 'I-ness' \- no mind !!   
It is simple awareness, where there is no 'I' arising,   
That is consciousness.   
When there is I thought popping out, there is mind.   
As long there is mind, there is Jagart Swapna Sushupti.   
Consciousness is beyond these three states, that implies, destruction of mind,  
which itself is I thought.   
Consciousness is (state) where there is no one who can own anymore the thought  
of consciousness. So long there is mind, there is owner to thoughts.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

so is there no consciousness when there are thoughts?   
consciousness IS.   
thoughts or no thougts. how does it matter. Infact that there is a thought  
itself is a proof that there is Consciousness.   
And infact, even now Consciousness is without thoughts. Consciousness is ever  
without thoughts: As even space is without clouds. Clouds float in space; but  
space is without clouds.   
So presence or absence of clouds is not a problem for Space.

Consciousness ever is, no doubt about it,   
its as simple as the difference between Sri Ramana Maharshi and us...   
Curds is found in Milk itself, can we drink milk thinking it as curds? there  
is difference, Milk is milk, curds is curds, though both are in essence one  
and the same.   
When there is curds, it is no more Milk.   
Thats the point

Ramana ate food, we eat food.   
Ramana slept, we sleep.

Sri Ramakrishna said: "God has form and He is formless too. Further, He is beyond both form and  
formlessness. No one can limit Him."   
No can can limit the Universal Consciousness.   
If someone thinks that only recluse can get Self-Realisation, a Lahiri  
Mahasaya is born.   
If someone thinks that only devotees of Siva can get God-Realisation, a  
Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is born.   
If someone thinks that only men can get God-Realisation, a Maa Anandamayi is  
born.   
If someone thinks that God cannot be realised through idol worship, a  
Ramakrisha is born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realised through idol worship, a Ramana  
Maharshi is born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realized through rituals, a Buddha is  
born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realized in India, a Jesus Christ is  
born.   
If someone thinks that only economically sound people can have realization, a  
Nisargadatta Maharaj is born.   
If someone thinks that only grown-ups can get self-realization, a Jnana  
Sambandar is born.   
If someone thinks that only learned people can get self-realization, a Sarada  
Devi is born.   
If someone thinks a learned people can never get Self-realization, a  
Shankaracharya is born.   
If someone thinks that one can get self-realisation only by satsangs of a  
personal guru, A J. Krishnamurthy is born.   
Whenever there appeared to be a limiting opinion about Universal  
Consciousness, it reappears in a form and shows that it is beyond that limit  
also.   
The Universal Consciousness is beyond all forms.   
However for devotees It is amenable to all forms.   
It is the Krishna of Krishna devotees.   
It is the Shiva of Shiva devotees.   
It is the Ramakrishna of Ramakrisha devotees.   
If is the Ramana of Ramana devotees.   
It is the Christ of Christ devotees.   
It is the Buddha of Buddha devotees.   
So Sri Ramakrisha said: "God has form and He is formless too. Further, He is beyond both form and  
formlessness. No one can limit Him."

Bhagavan Ramana has said: The inherent nature of the Self is Bliss. Some kind of knowledge   
has to be admitted, even in the realization of the supreme bliss.   
It may be said to be subtler than the subtlest.   
The word Vijnana [clear knowledge] is used both to denote the realization of  
the Self and knowing the objects. The Self is wisdom. It functions in two  
ways. When associated with ego, the knowledge is objective [vijnana]. When  
divested of the ego, and the universal Self is realized, it is also called  
Vijnana. The word raises a mental concept. Therefore, we say that the Self  
realized sage knows by his mind, but his mind is pure. Again we say that by  
the vibrating mind is impure and the placid mind is pure. The pure mind is  
itself Brahman. Therefore it follows that Brahman is not other than the mind  
of the Sage.   
*   
To a question as to what is meant by Jnana and Vijnana, Bhagavan Ramana has  
answered in that context: These words may mean differently according to the  
context. Jnana = Samanya Jnana or Pure Consciousness. Vijnana = Visesha  
Jnana. Visesha Jnana may be: a) wordly [relative knowledge]; and b]  
Transcendental - Self realization.   
*   
Guru Vachaka Kovai Verse 1106 states: The pure mind of a Jnani, which exists and shines as the witness, is a mirror  
that reflects even the impure thoughts that arise in his presence, in those  
whose minds are completely warped. Thus,   
he mystifies the minds of others in his presence, by giving the impression  
that he is a deluded person.   
*   
Muruganar also accepted this concept of the impure and pure mind,   
and called them as Chittarivu [small knowledge] and Perarivu [grand  
knowledge].   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian garu,   
Bhagavan Ramana says, When the indefinable power of Brahman separates itself  
from Brahman and, in union with the reflection of consciousness (Chidabhasa)  
assumes various forms, it is called the **impure mind**. When it becomes free  
from the reflection of consciousness (abhasa), through discrimination, it is  
called the **pure mind**.   
But there are no answers to questions like   
why does we assume various forms i.e have impure mind??   
how did karma started in the beginning?   
why god created the universe ??   
Where does maya come from and how did it originate?   
But when these kind of questions were asked by some devotees ramana's typical  
answer was to ask to whom these doubts arise? His typical brahmastram :-)

Dear Subramanian,   
That is not like that.   
What is mithya is asat. it cannot become SAT.   
Look at the following statements: The Post is the Ghost.   
The Ghost came from Post.   
The Ghost is unreal.   
Mind is the Ghost. Self is SAT. The Ghost does not "Become" Post. The Ghost is  
not there at all. There was always the post.   
So now, that does not mean, the "Ghost-Like" Appearance vanishes. IT  
continues; but you are not confused that it is Ghost.   
You only see Self.   
This is what Bhagavan said when he said "I have no thoughts". Not that the  
thoughts are not appearing etc. But that they are like the   
Ghost imagined on the pole. They continue to appear. .. but we know there is  
only Consciousness.   
Love!

Where were the thoughts during sushupti?   
Why then the thoughts arise again after waking from sleep?   
As long as there is 'I' thought, so long there will be mind, thoughts.   
When the I is merged, thoughts, Mind, all are naught.   
This is the essence of Dakshinamurthy. the Universal consciousness is Pure  
without a pinch of 'I-ness' \- no mind !!   
It is simple awareness, where there is no 'I' arising,   
That is consciousness.   
When there is I thought popping out, there is mind.   
As long there is mind, there is Jagart Swapna Sushupti.   
Consciousness is beyond these three states, that implies, destruction of mind,  
which itself is I thought.   
Consciousness is (state) where there is no one who can own anymore the thought  
of consciousness. So long there is mind, there is owner to thoughts.

And infact, even now Consciousness is without thoughts. Consciousness is ever

Consciousness ever is, no doubt about it,   
its as simple as the difference between Sri Ramana Maharshi and us...   
Curds is found in Milk itself, can we drink milk thinking it as curds? there  
is difference, Milk is milk, curds is curds, though both are in essence one  
and the same.   
When there is curds, it is no more Milk.   
Thats the point

## Universal Consciousness: Beyond all limitations  
Author: silentgreen         Date: November 27, 2009, 12:16:42 PM

Sri Ramakrishna said: "God has form and He is formless too. Further, He is beyond both form and  
formlessness. No one can limit Him."   
No can can limit the Universal Consciousness.   
If someone thinks that only recluse can get Self-Realisation, a Lahiri  
Mahasaya is born.   
If someone thinks that only devotees of Siva can get God-Realisation, a  
Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is born.   
If someone thinks that only men can get God-Realisation, a Maa Anandamayi is  
born.   
If someone thinks that God cannot be realised through idol worship, a  
Ramakrisha is born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realised through idol worship, a Ramana  
Maharshi is born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realized through rituals, a Buddha is  
born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realized in India, a Jesus Christ is  
born.   
If someone thinks that only economically sound people can have realization, a  
Nisargadatta Maharaj is born.   
If someone thinks that only grown-ups can get self-realization, a Jnana  
Sambandar is born.   
If someone thinks that only learned people can get self-realization, a Sarada  
Devi is born.   
If someone thinks a learned people can never get Self-realization, a  
Shankaracharya is born.   
If someone thinks that one can get self-realisation only by satsangs of a  
personal guru, A J. Krishnamurthy is born.   
Whenever there appeared to be a limiting opinion about Universal  
Consciousness, it reappears in a form and shows that it is beyond that limit  
also.   
The Universal Consciousness is beyond all forms.   
However for devotees It is amenable to all forms.   
It is the Krishna of Krishna devotees.   
It is the Shiva of Shiva devotees.   
It is the Ramakrishna of Ramakrisha devotees.   
If is the Ramana of Ramana devotees.   
It is the Christ of Christ devotees.   
It is the Buddha of Buddha devotees.   
So Sri Ramakrisha said: "God has form and He is formless too. Further, He is beyond both form and  
formlessness. No one can limit Him."

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent.   
The universal consciousness cuts across all barriers. That is why   
it is universal, limitless, beyond names and forms. But a person   
who has realized this Advaita Siddhi sees in every form and name   
the Consciousness.   
Saint Jnana Deva, who was in and out a Panduranga (Krishna)   
bhakta had this Advaita Siddhi towards the end of his life. He   
stopped going to the temple, sat simply on the banks of Chandrbhaga river and  
whatever devotees gave him, he was   
eating. Once devotees placed a couple of roti (bread) pieces   
and some jaggery on a leaf and left. Soon a dog came and grabbed   
one roti and was running away. The devotees were aghast not   
knowing what to do? Jnana Deva ran behind the dog, caught it   
and said: O Panduranga, you have taken only the roti. How will   
you eat this dry food. Why not you take this jaggery also?   
Bhagavan Ramana once had a monkey which was stoned and beaten   
up. He used to nurse it everyday. Soon it became alright. On   
seeing the wounds healed up, He rejoiced. The same was the case   
with another dog also. Sri Arunachala Pancharatnam Verse 5: Unnaikkandu ellam unnruvai   
Anniyamil anbu seyym annon.....   
He who, with Heart to you surrendered,   
Beholds for ever you alone.   
Sees all things as forms of you   
And loves and serves them as none other   
Than the Self, O Arunachala!   
Triumphs because he is immersed   
In you whose being is pure bliss.   
Thank you, silentgreen.   
Arunachala Siva.

How can mind become Self?   
mind is mithya.   
Self is Truth.   
So one cannot become the other.   
There is really no difference between normal and universal consciousness.  
There is only one: Consciousness.   
like the space in a pot and space outside. .. we have artificially marked it  
as universal consciousness and normal consciousness.   
There is just Consciousness. what is normal consciousness is also the  
universal.

Dear srkudai,   
We begin saying that the world is unreal. It is for the purpose of   
continuing our seeking the Self. Once the Self is realized, the world   
is Real, Brahma Swarupam. Similarly, the mind is mithya, seemingly   
real on seemingly unreal for the purpose of sadhana. Once the   
self realization takes place it becomes the Brahman.   
*   
Bhagavan Ramana has said: The inherent nature of the Self is Bliss. Some kind of knowledge   
has to be admitted, even in the realization of the supreme bliss.   
It may be said to be subtler than the subtlest.   
The word Vijnana [clear knowledge] is used both to denote the realization of

Consciousness ever is, no doubt about it,   
its as simple as the difference between Sri Ramana Maharshi and us...   
Curds is found in Milk itself, can we drink milk thinking it as curds? there  
is difference, Milk is milk, curds is curds, though both are in essence one  
and the same.   
When there is curds, it is no more Milk.   
Thats the point

What is the difference between Ramana and us?   
Ramana ate food, we eat food.   
Ramana slept, we sleep.   
Ramana had dreams, we have dreams.   
Ramana talked, we talk.   
Ramana snored, we snore.   
What is the difference?

Dear srkudai,   
Yes. I agree Consciousness is both Bhagavan Ramana and we. But   
our consciousness, is more often than not, mind-consciousness,   
ego-consciousness and world consciousness. Bhagavan Ramana is   
ever, eternally unchanging Pure Consciousness. It is pure because   
it is without mind/ego and the world. Even we taste this Pure   
Consciousness, with our mind curling up with the Self in deep sleep.   
If we are denied, even these few hours of sleep everyday, we shall all go mad,  
because the mind and the world is too much with us.   
Murugnar covers these aspects in his Guru Vachaka Kovai verses: Verse 967: Iswara, the Atma Swarupam, while remaining beyond   
mind-consciousness and shining free from attributes and limitations, assumes  
thee two [attributes and limitations] through pure maya, and then appears in  
the very visible form of the physical Guru in order to bestow His grace on  
devotees. His grace is only   
the Being-Consciousness that shines unbroken as 'I-I' in the stillness [that  
is experienced ] when the ego subsides in the Heart,   
its Source, by enquiry, with its attention turned towards the Self.   
Verse 985: In truth, only the Self, Pure Consciousness, causes the  
appearances of all imaginary differences by appearing as the illusory limited  
consciousness. Therefore, true Jnanis who have known and attained through  
enquiry the Self that shines equally   
in everything, all those other things are wholly Self [tanmaya].   
Verse 1009: The eternal state, the refuge where one rests free   
from the weariness of wandering hither and thither in distress, is the  
wondrous turiya firmament, Sivam, the Self Supreme, which flouishes as the  
undivided being consciousness and is revealed by   
the Jnana Guru.   
Verse 1010: If you abide unshakeably in the Self, that state will destroy the  
bond created by sankalpas, like a snake shuffling of its slough. When you  
persevere, abiding in such nishta [Self abidance] to the very end, that which  
manifests is the absolutely empty firmament of Pure Consciousness.   
Verse 1036: Since the dualistic differences do not, in truth, exist, the Self  
is only the being that is perfectly Pure Consciounsess which is entirely free  
from any trace of knowledge and ignorance. In that Self, the Brahma Swarupam  
that is intense Prajnana, know that there is not even a trace of ignorance.   
Verse 1037: If the Self does not exist as being-consciousness, how can the  
diverse vijnana differences [knowledge of specific things] arise in it?  
Therefore that Brahman, the Self is not only free from ignorance, but is  
itself the Swarupam, the Transcendental Consciousness.   
Verse 1046: It exists as the extremely subtle light of being consciousness;  
it is without the rising of the ego that objectively   
knows 'alien' objects as 'this'. Trying to know it, the intellect, the jiva  
bodha, grows exhausted and laments, 'I have not known it'.   
It is concentrated mauna. Such is the Self, being consciousness.   
Verse 1058: Because of the excellence of the Swarupam, the oneness in which  
the seer himself becomes the seeing, one's   
real nature is the most exalted. The 'I' nature, the mauna-light   
in which the ego, the seer 'I' has completely died, is the Self,   
Consciousness the Supreme.   
Verse 1059: The Swarupam that is the abode of the bliss of consciousness is  
the vast ocean and deep ocean of intense   
peace. Those who dive deep within by merging their minds in the Heart, will  
attain the eternal and inexhaustible treasure of he grace of the Self.   
Verse 1064: You should know that 'I' the form of consciousness, by enquiring  
'Who am I?' with calm deliberation, and then get absorbed in your Swarupam,  
consciousness. What purpose is served instead by separating yourself from  
that consciousness, deluding yourself by taking yourself to be the chidabhasa,  
the mind-form dwelling in the ruinous sense objects and suffering?   
Verse 1115: The Jnani knows the entire world that appears in consciousness as  
Pure Consciousness alone. Realizing that the world has no independent reality  
apart from Consciousness, he will abide calmly in the Self. He is the wealthy  
and fortunate one.   
Verse 1117: The Swarupam alone exists in the Swarupam, the nondual fullness  
that is Pure Consciousnes and supreme grace.   
Within it the differences of the 'I' [the seer] and 'this' [the seen]   
do not exist. Therefore, those whose minds have dived deep in that fullness  
will not suffer and lament in the false life of duality that is an imaginary  
appearance.   
Verse 1222: That which shines as the residue is the peace that is wholly  
consciousness. That indeed is the eternal Sivam. That residue, the  
consummate supreme, is aham _, the ego-free mauna that is the culmination of  
liberation.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 You have put it nicely. There being only consciousness. .. we see its reflection in the mind. .. the reflection is seen as changing due to ripples and we think consciousness is changing. its purely the reflection that is changing.   
Consciousness is every Self.   
there is really no mind-consciousness. the mind functions in the presence of  
consciousness and we seem to somehow associate mind forms with consciousness  
... this we should stop.   
its like my mind is calm and i feel i am calm.   
my mind is full of thoughts, i think i have thoughts.   
just a point that needs consideration: if mind is full of agitations, how can  
we say i am agitated, since i am consciousness and not the mind!!   
Love!

Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 02, 2010, 10:15:36 AM

Dear everyone,   
The discussions came for the purpose of knowing and understanding   
the Universal Consciousness. I shall illustrate Universal Consciousness with  
three examples.   
1\. Swami Vivekananda [after his return from America] was staying   
in Belur Math. During a night, he had no proper sleep. He was turning from  
side to side during the night, and this was noticed by some devotees, who were  
lying in the adjacent room. In the morning, they asked Swami for the reasons  
for restless sleep. Swami Vivekananda then explained: "I think there is  
something seriously wrong somewhere in the world. I could sense people crying  
and running!" The morning newspapers carried a headline story where it was  
reported that there was an earthquake in South America and thousands had been  
killed and some more thousands had been injured. The book of SRK Math has  
described the story and also called it as Universal Consciousness. Not  
everyone gets such a sense of a danger happening elsewhere in the world. This  
is   
Pure Consciousness which pervades the whole universe.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana was sitting in the Hall. Devotees were   
vociferously discussing the war news. Nazi forces had captured   
Paris in 4 days and were relentlessly bombing London. [Eagles   
Over London]. The defeat of Allied Forces was expected to happen soon. At  
that time, Russia [later Soviet Union] had not participated   
in the war as yet. Bhagavan Ramana said: 'Eh, but Russia....' He   
did not continue the sentence. Within 6 months, Russia had joined the war,  
and an angry Nazi forces moved towards Russia and were   
nearing Stalingrad. But the Nazi forces could not put up with the   
biting cold of Russia and were limping with handicaps of fever, shivering, and  
other problems of food etc., The Nazi forces thus   
lost the battle of Stalingrad. Soon Russia started their march towards Berlin  
and the Allied forces including Russia invaded Germany and Berlin was  
bombarded. The Allied Forces won the   
second world war. Bhagavan through His universal consciouness,   
could visualize this scenario but did not want to say anything in   
detail.   
3\. Once Kavyakanta said that the town of Tiruvannamalai is like   
a Sri Chakra and soon a town-ship would evolve around this Asramam. This was  
smilingly concurred with by Bhagavan too.   
In another 15 years, Ramana Nagar developed. The Westerners   
built cottages on either side of the Asramam.   
The Universal Consciousness is Pure Consciousness, where the   
Pure Mind pervades the whole universe. Our consciousness which   
is impure, ego-covered, cannot visualize such things concerning the   
whole universe.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 these are powers. they belong to the mind. coz they pertain to the mithya world.   
There is absolutely no difference between universal consciousness and normal  
consciousness.

well said udai garu.   
There is no difference between universal consciousness and normal  
consciousness.   
Subramanian garu,   
You said vivekananda has pure consciousness.Can you please let us know if he  
had pure consciousness always?   
Once bhagavan ramana when asked about swami vivekananda he said as below   
Quote  
30th September, 1936   
 **Talk 252.**   
D.: Sri Ramakrishna touched Vivekananda and the latter realised Bliss. Is it  
possible?   
M.: Sri Ramakrishna did not touch all for that purpose. He did not create  
Atma. He did not create Realisation. **Vivekananda was ripe.He was anxious to  
realise. He must have completed the preliminary course in his past births.  
Such is possible for ripe persons only.**   
D.: Can the same miracle be worked for all?   
M.: If they are fit. Fitness is the point. A strong man controls the weaker  
man. **A strong mind controls the weaker mind. That was what happened in the  
case cited. The effect was only temporary. Why did Vivekananda not sit quiet?  
Why did he wander about after such a miracle? Because the effect was only  
temporary.**   
Source: TALKS WITH SRI RAMANA MAHARSHI Book   
Devotee: Bhagavan, it is said that Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa put his palm on  
the head of Swami Vivekananda and that the latter had transcendental  
experience. Could you not do some such thing for me.   
Bhagavan smiled and said: Yes, scriptures speak of such dikshas (initiations)  
and hastha diksha is one of them. **But that too is a limitation. When a  
mighty river runs overflowing its banks, why divert it into a particular  
channel? Let all those who are thirsty drink to their heart 's content and  
capacity.**   
\-- Quotations and Conversations Found in the Ramana Pictorial Souvenir, 1967

2) Talks With Ramana Maharshi Book  
http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/forum/index.php?topic=4872.0   
Even kavyakanta for that matter is not fully realised which means he is not  
always having pure consciousness.   
Quote  
Though a sincere sadhak, Sastri laid his hands on too many pots.   
Politics, Spiritual upliftment of Indians through mantra japas,   
Congress committee work, visiting various holy places, (he had   
visited 55 temples or holy places in India). His Sankalpas were   
many and strong. When Bhagavan Ramana was informed of his   
passing away, and when someone at that time, asked Him, whether   
Sastri had attained liberation, Bhagavan Ramana said: "How can   
it be, he had many sankalpas.

Dear prasanth,   
I brought Swami Vivekananda and Kavyakanta Ganapati Sastri   
only to show their universal consciousness. I am not sure whether   
he had it permanently or temporarily. But Kavyakanta, as Bhagavan   
Ramana said in Verse 80 of AAMM, had the glimpse of transcendence,   
of pure nirvikalpa samadhi. He had this glimpses on many occasions   
in Tiruvannamalai.

For Bhagavan everything was happening on itself like a cloud in the sky. It is  
the truth. Because He understood the truth and He was (is now also) witnessing  
whereas due to ignorance we think I am eating, sleeping, walking and I am  
suffering. We are not witnessing the happenings. Is it? This is my  
understanding.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. Bhagavan Ramana was "experiencing" the future as if it is   
"present", because He ever lives in the 'present'. Actually, it is   
not 'visualizing' that is "seeing something happening in future".   
He never saw anything, because He is the Eye of the eye.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Who am I?: "To keep the mind ever   
abiding in Atma is true Jnana Dhrishti. Knowing what is happening in a far  
off place, or knowing someone else's mind, or knowing the past, present and  
future are not Jnana Dhrishti.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 You have put it nicely. There being only consciousness. .. we see its reflection in the mind. .. the reflection is seen as changing due to ripples and we think consciousness is changing. its purely the reflection that is changing.   
Consciousness is every Self.   
there is really no mind-consciousness. the mind functions in the presence of  
consciousness and we seem to somehow associate mind forms with consciousness  
... this we should stop.   
its like my mind is calm and i feel i am calm.   
my mind is full of thoughts, i think i have thoughts.   
just a point that needs consideration: if mind is full of agitations, how can  
we say i am agitated, since i am consciousness and not the mind!!

Dear everyone,   
The discussions came for the purpose of knowing and understanding   
the Universal Consciousness. I shall illustrate Universal Consciousness with  
three examples.   
1\. Swami Vivekananda [after his return from America] was staying   
in Belur Math. During a night, he had no proper sleep. He was turning from  
side to side during the night, and this was noticed by some devotees, who were  
lying in the adjacent room. In the morning, they asked Swami for the reasons  
for restless sleep. Swami Vivekananda then explained: "I think there is  
something seriously wrong somewhere in the world. I could sense people crying  
and running!" The morning newspapers carried a headline story where it was  
reported that there was an earthquake in South America and thousands had been  
killed and some more thousands had been injured. The book of SRK Math has  
described the story and also called it as Universal Consciousness. Not  
everyone gets such a sense of a danger happening elsewhere in the world. This  
is   
Pure Consciousness which pervades the whole universe.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana was sitting in the Hall. Devotees were   
vociferously discussing the war news. Nazi forces had captured   
Paris in 4 days and were relentlessly bombing London. [Eagles   
Over London]. The defeat of Allied Forces was expected to happen soon. At  
that time, Russia [later Soviet Union] had not participated   
in the war as yet. Bhagavan Ramana said: 'Eh, but Russia....' He   
did not continue the sentence. Within 6 months, Russia had joined the war,  
and an angry Nazi forces moved towards Russia and were   
nearing Stalingrad. But the Nazi forces could not put up with the   
biting cold of Russia and were limping with handicaps of fever, shivering, and  
other problems of food etc., The Nazi forces thus   
lost the battle of Stalingrad. Soon Russia started their march towards Berlin  
and the Allied forces including Russia invaded Germany and Berlin was  
bombarded. The Allied Forces won the   
second world war. Bhagavan through His universal consciouness,   
could visualize this scenario but did not want to say anything in   
detail.   
3\. Once Kavyakanta said that the town of Tiruvannamalai is like   
a Sri Chakra and soon a town-ship would evolve around this Asramam. This was  
smilingly concurred with by Bhagavan too.   
In another 15 years, Ramana Nagar developed. The Westerners   
built cottages on either side of the Asramam.   
The Universal Consciousness is Pure Consciousness, where the   
Pure Mind pervades the whole universe. Our consciousness which   
is impure, ego-covered, cannot visualize such things concerning the   
whole universe.   
Arunachala Siva.

well said udai garu.   
There is no difference between universal consciousness and normal  
consciousness.   
Subramanian garu,   
You said vivekananda has pure consciousness.Can you please let us know if he  
had pure consciousness always?   
Once bhagavan ramana when asked about swami vivekananda he said as below   
Quote  
30th September, 1936   
 **Talk 252.**   
D.: Sri Ramakrishna touched Vivekananda and the latter realised Bliss. Is it  
possible?   
M.: Sri Ramakrishna did not touch all for that purpose. He did not create  
Atma. He did not create Realisation. **Vivekananda was ripe.He was anxious to  
realise. He must have completed the preliminary course in his past births.  
Such is possible for ripe persons only.**   
D.: Can the same miracle be worked for all?   
M.: If they are fit. Fitness is the point. A strong man controls the weaker  
man. **A strong mind controls the weaker mind. That was what happened in the  
case cited. The effect was only temporary. Why did Vivekananda not sit quiet?  
Why did he wander about after such a miracle? Because the effect was only  
temporary.**   
Source: TALKS WITH SRI RAMANA MAHARSHI Book   
Devotee: Bhagavan, it is said that Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa put his palm on  
the head of Swami Vivekananda and that the latter had transcendental  
experience. Could you not do some such thing for me.   
Bhagavan smiled and said: Yes, scriptures speak of such dikshas (initiations)  
and hastha diksha is one of them. **But that too is a limitation. When a  
mighty river runs overflowing its banks, why divert it into a particular  
channel? Let all those who are thirsty drink to their heart 's content and  
capacity.**   
\-- Quotations and Conversations Found in the Ramana Pictorial Souvenir, 1967

2) Talks With Ramana Maharshi Book  
http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/forum/index.php?topic=4872.0   
Even kavyakanta for that matter is not fully realised which means he is not  
always having pure consciousness.   
Quote  
Though a sincere sadhak, Sastri laid his hands on too many pots.   
Politics, Spiritual upliftment of Indians through mantra japas,   
Congress committee work, visiting various holy places, (he had   
visited 55 temples or holy places in India). His Sankalpas were   
many and strong. When Bhagavan Ramana was informed of his   
passing away, and when someone at that time, asked Him, whether   
Sastri had attained liberation, Bhagavan Ramana said: "How can   
it be, he had many sankalpas.

Dear prasanth,   
I brought Swami Vivekananda and Kavyakanta Ganapati Sastri   
only to show their universal consciousness. I am not sure whether   
he had it permanently or temporarily. But Kavyakanta, as Bhagavan   
Ramana said in Verse 80 of AAMM, had the glimpse of transcendence,   
of pure nirvikalpa samadhi. He had this glimpses on many occasions   
in Tiruvannamalai.

For Bhagavan everything was happening on itself like a cloud in the sky. It is  
the truth. Because He understood the truth and He was (is now also) witnessing  
whereas due to ignorance we think I am eating, sleeping, walking and I am  
suffering. We are not witnessing the happenings. Is it? This is my  
understanding.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. Bhagavan Ramana was "experiencing" the future as if it is   
"present", because He ever lives in the 'present'. Actually, it is   
not 'visualizing' that is "seeing something happening in future".   
He never saw anything, because He is the Eye of the eye.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Who am I?: "To keep the mind ever   
abiding in Atma is true Jnana Dhrishti. Knowing what is happening in a far  
off place, or knowing someone else's mind, or knowing the past, present and  
future are not Jnana Dhrishti.   
Arunachala Siva.

Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 01, 2010, 08:19:45 PM

Dear srkudai,   
Yes. I agree Consciousness is both Bhagavan Ramana and we. But   
our consciousness, is more often than not, mind-consciousness,   
ego-consciousness and world consciousness. Bhagavan Ramana is   
ever, eternally unchanging Pure Consciousness. It is pure because   
it is without mind/ego and the world. Even we taste this Pure   
Consciousness, with our mind curling up with the Self in deep sleep.   
If we are denied, even these few hours of sleep everyday, we shall all go mad,  
because the mind and the world is too much with us.   
Murugnar covers these aspects in his Guru Vachaka Kovai verses: Verse 967: Iswara, the Atma Swarupam, while remaining beyond   
mind-consciousness and shining free from attributes and limitations, assumes  
thee two [attributes and limitations] through pure maya, and then appears in  
the very visible form of the physical Guru in order to bestow His grace on  
devotees. His grace is only   
the Being-Consciousness that shines unbroken as 'I-I' in the stillness [that  
is experienced ] when the ego subsides in the Heart,   
its Source, by enquiry, with its attention turned towards the Self.   
Verse 985: In truth, only the Self, Pure Consciousness, causes the  
appearances of all imaginary differences by appearing as the illusory limited  
consciousness. Therefore, true Jnanis who have known and attained through  
enquiry the Self that shines equally   
in everything, all those other things are wholly Self [tanmaya].   
Verse 1009: The eternal state, the refuge where one rests free   
from the weariness of wandering hither and thither in distress, is the  
wondrous turiya firmament, Sivam, the Self Supreme, which flouishes as the  
undivided being consciousness and is revealed by   
the Jnana Guru.   
Verse 1010: If you abide unshakeably in the Self, that state will destroy the  
bond created by sankalpas, like a snake shuffling of its slough. When you  
persevere, abiding in such nishta [Self abidance] to the very end, that which  
manifests is the absolutely empty firmament of Pure Consciousness.   
Verse 1036: Since the dualistic differences do not, in truth, exist, the Self  
is only the being that is perfectly Pure Consciounsess which is entirely free  
from any trace of knowledge and ignorance. In that Self, the Brahma Swarupam  
that is intense Prajnana, know that there is not even a trace of ignorance.   
Verse 1037: If the Self does not exist as being-consciousness, how can the  
diverse vijnana differences [knowledge of specific things] arise in it?  
Therefore that Brahman, the Self is not only free from ignorance, but is  
itself the Swarupam, the Transcendental Consciousness.   
Verse 1046: It exists as the extremely subtle light of being consciousness;  
it is without the rising of the ego that objectively   
knows 'alien' objects as 'this'. Trying to know it, the intellect, the jiva  
bodha, grows exhausted and laments, 'I have not known it'.   
It is concentrated mauna. Such is the Self, being consciousness.   
Verse 1058: Because of the excellence of the Swarupam, the oneness in which  
the seer himself becomes the seeing, one's   
real nature is the most exalted. The 'I' nature, the mauna-light   
in which the ego, the seer 'I' has completely died, is the Self,   
Consciousness the Supreme.   
Verse 1059: The Swarupam that is the abode of the bliss of consciousness is  
the vast ocean and deep ocean of intense   
peace. Those who dive deep within by merging their minds in the Heart, will  
attain the eternal and inexhaustible treasure of he grace of the Self.   
Verse 1064: You should know that 'I' the form of consciousness, by enquiring  
'Who am I?' with calm deliberation, and then get absorbed in your Swarupam,  
consciousness. What purpose is served instead by separating yourself from  
that consciousness, deluding yourself by taking yourself to be the chidabhasa,  
the mind-form dwelling in the ruinous sense objects and suffering?   
Verse 1115: The Jnani knows the entire world that appears in consciousness as  
Pure Consciousness alone. Realizing that the world has no independent reality  
apart from Consciousness, he will abide calmly in the Self. He is the wealthy  
and fortunate one.   
Verse 1117: The Swarupam alone exists in the Swarupam, the nondual fullness  
that is Pure Consciousnes and supreme grace.   
Within it the differences of the 'I' [the seer] and 'this' [the seen]   
do not exist. Therefore, those whose minds have dived deep in that fullness  
will not suffer and lament in the false life of duality that is an imaginary  
appearance.   
Verse 1222: That which shines as the residue is the peace that is wholly  
consciousness. That indeed is the eternal Sivam. That residue, the  
consummate supreme, is aham _, the ego-free mauna that is the culmination of  
liberation.   
Arunachala Siva.

D.: Sri Ramakrishna touched Vivekananda and the latter realised Bliss. Is it  
possible?   
M.: Sri Ramakrishna did not touch all for that purpose. He did not create  
Atma. He did not create Realisation. **Vivekananda was ripe.He was anxious to  
realise. He must have completed the preliminary course in his past births.  
Such is possible for ripe persons only.**   
D.: Can the same miracle be worked for all?   
M.: If they are fit. Fitness is the point. A strong man controls the weaker  
man. **A strong mind controls the weaker mind. That was what happened in the  
case cited. The effect was only temporary. Why did Vivekananda not sit quiet?  
Why did he wander about after such a miracle? Because the effect was only  
temporary.**

Devotee: Bhagavan, it is said that Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa put his palm on  
the head of Swami Vivekananda and that the latter had transcendental  
experience. Could you not do some such thing for me.   
Bhagavan smiled and said: Yes, scriptures speak of such dikshas (initiations)  
and hastha diksha is one of them. **But that too is a limitation. When a  
mighty river runs overflowing its banks, why divert it into a particular  
channel? Let all those who are thirsty drink to their heart 's content and

Dear prasanth,   
I brought Swami Vivekananda and Kavyakanta Ganapati Sastri   
only to show their universal consciousness. I am not sure whether   
he had it permanently or temporarily. But Kavyakanta, as Bhagavan   
Ramana said in Verse 80 of AAMM, had the glimpse of transcendence,   
of pure nirvikalpa samadhi. He had this glimpses on many occasions   
in Tiruvannamalai.

For Bhagavan everything was happening on itself like a cloud in the sky. It is  
the truth. Because He understood the truth and He was (is now also) witnessing  
whereas due to ignorance we think I am eating, sleeping, walking and I am  
suffering. We are not witnessing the happenings. Is it? This is my

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. Bhagavan Ramana was "experiencing" the future as if it is   
"present", because He ever lives in the 'present'. Actually, it is   
not 'visualizing' that is "seeing something happening in future".   
He never saw anything, because He is the Eye of the eye.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Who am I?: "To keep the mind ever   
abiding in Atma is true Jnana Dhrishti. Knowing what is happening in a far  
off place, or knowing someone else's mind, or knowing the past, present and  
future are not Jnana Dhrishti.   
Arunachala Siva.

Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 01, 2010, 08:19:45 PM

Dear srkudai,   
Yes. I agree Consciousness is both Bhagavan Ramana and we. But   
our consciousness, is more often than not, mind-consciousness,   
ego-consciousness and world consciousness. Bhagavan Ramana is   
ever, eternally unchanging Pure Consciousness. It is pure because   
it is without mind/ego and the world. Even we taste this Pure   
Consciousness, with our mind curling up with the Self in deep sleep.   
If we are denied, even these few hours of sleep everyday, we shall all go mad,  
because the mind and the world is too much with us.   
Murugnar covers these aspects in his Guru Vachaka Kovai verses: Verse 967: Iswara, the Atma Swarupam, while remaining beyond   
mind-consciousness and shining free from attributes and limitations, assumes  
thee two [attributes and limitations] through pure maya, and then appears in  
the very visible form of the physical Guru in order to bestow His grace on  
devotees. His grace is only   
the Being-Consciousness that shines unbroken as 'I-I' in the stillness [that  
is experienced ] when the ego subsides in the Heart,   
its Source, by enquiry, with its attention turned towards the Self.   
Verse 985: In truth, only the Self, Pure Consciousness, causes the  
appearances of all imaginary differences by appearing as the illusory limited  
consciousness. Therefore, true Jnanis who have known and attained through  
enquiry the Self that shines equally   
in everything, all those other things are wholly Self [tanmaya].   
Verse 1009: The eternal state, the refuge where one rests free   
from the weariness of wandering hither and thither in distress, is the  
wondrous turiya firmament, Sivam, the Self Supreme, which flouishes as the  
undivided being consciousness and is revealed by   
the Jnana Guru.   
Verse 1010: If you abide unshakeably in the Self, that state will destroy the  
bond created by sankalpas, like a snake shuffling of its slough. When you  
persevere, abiding in such nishta [Self abidance] to the very end, that which  
manifests is the absolutely empty firmament of Pure Consciousness.   
Verse 1036: Since the dualistic differences do not, in truth, exist, the Self  
is only the being that is perfectly Pure Consciounsess which is entirely free  
from any trace of knowledge and ignorance. In that Self, the Brahma Swarupam  
that is intense Prajnana, know that there is not even a trace of ignorance.   
Verse 1037: If the Self does not exist as being-consciousness, how can the  
diverse vijnana differences [knowledge of specific things] arise in it?  
Therefore that Brahman, the Self is not only free from ignorance, but is  
itself the Swarupam, the Transcendental Consciousness.   
Verse 1046: It exists as the extremely subtle light of being consciousness;  
it is without the rising of the ego that objectively   
knows 'alien' objects as 'this'. Trying to know it, the intellect, the jiva  
bodha, grows exhausted and laments, 'I have not known it'.   
It is concentrated mauna. Such is the Self, being consciousness.   
Verse 1058: Because of the excellence of the Swarupam, the oneness in which  
the seer himself becomes the seeing, one's   
real nature is the most exalted. The 'I' nature, the mauna-light   
in which the ego, the seer 'I' has completely died, is the Self,   
Consciousness the Supreme.   
Verse 1059: The Swarupam that is the abode of the bliss of consciousness is  
the vast ocean and deep ocean of intense   
peace. Those who dive deep within by merging their minds in the Heart, will  
attain the eternal and inexhaustible treasure of he grace of the Self.   
Verse 1064: You should know that 'I' the form of consciousness, by enquiring  
'Who am I?' with calm deliberation, and then get absorbed in your Swarupam,  
consciousness. What purpose is served instead by separating yourself from  
that consciousness, deluding yourself by taking yourself to be the chidabhasa,  
the mind-form dwelling in the ruinous sense objects and suffering?   
Verse 1115: The Jnani knows the entire world that appears in consciousness as  
Pure Consciousness alone. Realizing that the world has no independent reality  
apart from Consciousness, he will abide calmly in the Self. He is the wealthy  
and fortunate one.   
Verse 1117: The Swarupam alone exists in the Swarupam, the nondual fullness  
that is Pure Consciousnes and supreme grace.   
Within it the differences of the 'I' [the seer] and 'this' [the seen]   
do not exist. Therefore, those whose minds have dived deep in that fullness  
will not suffer and lament in the false life of duality that is an imaginary  
appearance.   
Verse 1222: That which shines as the residue is the peace that is wholly  
consciousness. That indeed is the eternal Sivam. That residue, the  
consummate supreme, is aham _, the ego-free mauna that is the culmination of  
liberation.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 You have put it nicely. There being only consciousness. .. we see its reflection in the mind. .. the reflection is seen as changing due to ripples and we think consciousness is changing. its purely the reflection that is changing.   
Consciousness is every Self.   
there is really no mind-consciousness. the mind functions in the presence of  
consciousness and we seem to somehow associate mind forms with consciousness  
... this we should stop.   
its like my mind is calm and i feel i am calm.   
my mind is full of thoughts, i think i have thoughts.   
just a point that needs consideration: if mind is full of agitations, how can  
we say i am agitated, since i am consciousness and not the mind!!

Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 02, 2010, 10:15:36 AM

Dear everyone,   
The discussions came for the purpose of knowing and understanding   
the Universal Consciousness. I shall illustrate Universal Consciousness with  
three examples.   
1\. Swami Vivekananda [after his return from America] was staying   
in Belur Math. During a night, he had no proper sleep. He was turning from  
side to side during the night, and this was noticed by some devotees, who were  
lying in the adjacent room. In the morning, they asked Swami for the reasons  
for restless sleep. Swami Vivekananda then explained: "I think there is  
something seriously wrong somewhere in the world. I could sense people crying  
and running!" The morning newspapers carried a headline story where it was  
reported that there was an earthquake in South America and thousands had been  
killed and some more thousands had been injured. The book of SRK Math has  
described the story and also called it as Universal Consciousness. Not  
everyone gets such a sense of a danger happening elsewhere in the world. This  
is   
Pure Consciousness which pervades the whole universe.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana was sitting in the Hall. Devotees were   
vociferously discussing the war news. Nazi forces had captured   
Paris in 4 days and were relentlessly bombing London. [Eagles   
Over London]. The defeat of Allied Forces was expected to happen soon. At  
that time, Russia [later Soviet Union] had not participated   
in the war as yet. Bhagavan Ramana said: 'Eh, but Russia....' He   
did not continue the sentence. Within 6 months, Russia had joined the war,  
and an angry Nazi forces moved towards Russia and were   
nearing Stalingrad. But the Nazi forces could not put up with the   
biting cold of Russia and were limping with handicaps of fever, shivering, and  
other problems of food etc., The Nazi forces thus   
lost the battle of Stalingrad. Soon Russia started their march towards Berlin  
and the Allied forces including Russia invaded Germany and Berlin was  
bombarded. The Allied Forces won the   
second world war. Bhagavan through His universal consciouness,   
could visualize this scenario but did not want to say anything in   
detail.   
3\. Once Kavyakanta said that the town of Tiruvannamalai is like   
a Sri Chakra and soon a town-ship would evolve around this Asramam. This was  
smilingly concurred with by Bhagavan too.   
In another 15 years, Ramana Nagar developed. The Westerners   
built cottages on either side of the Asramam.   
The Universal Consciousness is Pure Consciousness, where the   
Pure Mind pervades the whole universe. Our consciousness which   
is impure, ego-covered, cannot visualize such things concerning the   
whole universe.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai,   
Yes. I agree Consciousness is both Bhagavan Ramana and we. But   
our consciousness, is more often than not, mind-consciousness,   
ego-consciousness and world consciousness. Bhagavan Ramana is   
ever, eternally unchanging Pure Consciousness. It is pure because   
it is without mind/ego and the world. Even we taste this Pure   
Consciousness, with our mind curling up with the Self in deep sleep.   
If we are denied, even these few hours of sleep everyday, we shall all go mad,  
because the mind and the world is too much with us.   
Murugnar covers these aspects in his Guru Vachaka Kovai verses: Verse 967: Iswara, the Atma Swarupam, while remaining beyond   
mind-consciousness and shining free from attributes and limitations, assumes  
thee two [attributes and limitations] through pure maya, and then appears in  
the very visible form of the physical Guru in order to bestow His grace on  
devotees. His grace is only   
the Being-Consciousness that shines unbroken as 'I-I' in the stillness [that  
is experienced ] when the ego subsides in the Heart,   
its Source, by enquiry, with its attention turned towards the Self.   
Verse 985: In truth, only the Self, Pure Consciousness, causes the  
appearances of all imaginary differences by appearing as the illusory limited  
consciousness. Therefore, true Jnanis who have known and attained through  
enquiry the Self that shines equally   
in everything, all those other things are wholly Self [tanmaya].   
Verse 1009: The eternal state, the refuge where one rests free   
from the weariness of wandering hither and thither in distress, is the  
wondrous turiya firmament, Sivam, the Self Supreme, which flouishes as the  
undivided being consciousness and is revealed by   
the Jnana Guru.   
Verse 1010: If you abide unshakeably in the Self, that state will destroy the  
bond created by sankalpas, like a snake shuffling of its slough. When you  
persevere, abiding in such nishta [Self abidance] to the very end, that which  
manifests is the absolutely empty firmament of Pure Consciousness.   
Verse 1036: Since the dualistic differences do not, in truth, exist, the Self  
is only the being that is perfectly Pure Consciounsess which is entirely free  
from any trace of knowledge and ignorance. In that Self, the Brahma Swarupam  
that is intense Prajnana, know that there is not even a trace of ignorance.   
Verse 1037: If the Self does not exist as being-consciousness, how can the  
diverse vijnana differences [knowledge of specific things] arise in it?  
Therefore that Brahman, the Self is not only free from ignorance, but is  
itself the Swarupam, the Transcendental Consciousness.   
Verse 1046: It exists as the extremely subtle light of being consciousness;  
it is without the rising of the ego that objectively   
knows 'alien' objects as 'this'. Trying to know it, the intellect, the jiva  
bodha, grows exhausted and laments, 'I have not known it'.   
It is concentrated mauna. Such is the Self, being consciousness.   
Verse 1058: Because of the excellence of the Swarupam, the oneness in which  
the seer himself becomes the seeing, one's   
real nature is the most exalted. The 'I' nature, the mauna-light   
in which the ego, the seer 'I' has completely died, is the Self,   
Consciousness the Supreme.   
Verse 1059: The Swarupam that is the abode of the bliss of consciousness is  
the vast ocean and deep ocean of intense   
peace. Those who dive deep within by merging their minds in the Heart, will  
attain the eternal and inexhaustible treasure of he grace of the Self.   
Verse 1064: You should know that 'I' the form of consciousness, by enquiring  
'Who am I?' with calm deliberation, and then get absorbed in your Swarupam,  
consciousness. What purpose is served instead by separating yourself from  
that consciousness, deluding yourself by taking yourself to be the chidabhasa,  
the mind-form dwelling in the ruinous sense objects and suffering?   
Verse 1115: The Jnani knows the entire world that appears in consciousness as  
Pure Consciousness alone. Realizing that the world has no independent reality  
apart from Consciousness, he will abide calmly in the Self. He is the wealthy  
and fortunate one.   
Verse 1117: The Swarupam alone exists in the Swarupam, the nondual fullness  
that is Pure Consciousnes and supreme grace.   
Within it the differences of the 'I' [the seer] and 'this' [the seen]   
do not exist. Therefore, those whose minds have dived deep in that fullness  
will not suffer and lament in the false life of duality that is an imaginary  
appearance.   
Verse 1222: That which shines as the residue is the peace that is wholly  
consciousness. That indeed is the eternal Sivam. That residue, the  
consummate supreme, is aham _, the ego-free mauna that is the culmination of  
liberation.

Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 02, 2010, 10:15:36 AM

Dear everyone,   
The discussions came for the purpose of knowing and understanding   
the Universal Consciousness. I shall illustrate Universal Consciousness with  
three examples.   
1\. Swami Vivekananda [after his return from America] was staying   
in Belur Math. During a night, he had no proper sleep. He was turning from  
side to side during the night, and this was noticed by some devotees, who were  
lying in the adjacent room. In the morning, they asked Swami for the reasons  
for restless sleep. Swami Vivekananda then explained: "I think there is  
something seriously wrong somewhere in the world. I could sense people crying  
and running!" The morning newspapers carried a headline story where it was  
reported that there was an earthquake in South America and thousands had been  
killed and some more thousands had been injured. The book of SRK Math has  
described the story and also called it as Universal Consciousness. Not  
everyone gets such a sense of a danger happening elsewhere in the world. This  
is   
Pure Consciousness which pervades the whole universe.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana was sitting in the Hall. Devotees were   
vociferously discussing the war news. Nazi forces had captured   
Paris in 4 days and were relentlessly bombing London. [Eagles   
Over London]. The defeat of Allied Forces was expected to happen soon. At  
that time, Russia [later Soviet Union] had not participated   
in the war as yet. Bhagavan Ramana said: 'Eh, but Russia....' He   
did not continue the sentence. Within 6 months, Russia had joined the war,  
and an angry Nazi forces moved towards Russia and were   
nearing Stalingrad. But the Nazi forces could not put up with the   
biting cold of Russia and were limping with handicaps of fever, shivering, and  
other problems of food etc., The Nazi forces thus   
lost the battle of Stalingrad. Soon Russia started their march towards Berlin  
and the Allied forces including Russia invaded Germany and Berlin was  
bombarded. The Allied Forces won the   
second world war. Bhagavan through His universal consciouness,   
could visualize this scenario but did not want to say anything in   
detail.   
3\. Once Kavyakanta said that the town of Tiruvannamalai is like   
a Sri Chakra and soon a town-ship would evolve around this Asramam. This was  
smilingly concurred with by Bhagavan too.   
In another 15 years, Ramana Nagar developed. The Westerners   
built cottages on either side of the Asramam.   
The Universal Consciousness is Pure Consciousness, where the   
Pure Mind pervades the whole universe. Our consciousness which   
is impure, ego-covered, cannot visualize such things concerning the   
whole universe.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 these are powers. they belong to the mind. coz they pertain to the mithya world.   
There is absolutely no difference between universal consciousness and normal

well said udai garu.   
There is no difference between universal consciousness and normal  
consciousness.   
Subramanian garu,   
You said vivekananda has pure consciousness.Can you please let us know if he  
had pure consciousness always?   
Once bhagavan ramana when asked about swami vivekananda he said as below   
Quote  
30th September, 1936   
 **Talk 252.**   
D.: Sri Ramakrishna touched Vivekananda and the latter realised Bliss. Is it  
possible?   
M.: Sri Ramakrishna did not touch all for that purpose. He did not create  
Atma. He did not create Realisation. **Vivekananda was ripe.He was anxious to  
realise. He must have completed the preliminary course in his past births.  
Such is possible for ripe persons only.**   
D.: Can the same miracle be worked for all?   
M.: If they are fit. Fitness is the point. A strong man controls the weaker  
man. **A strong mind controls the weaker mind. That was what happened in the  
case cited. The effect was only temporary. Why did Vivekananda not sit quiet?  
Why did he wander about after such a miracle? Because the effect was only  
temporary.**   
Source: TALKS WITH SRI RAMANA MAHARSHI Book   
Devotee: Bhagavan, it is said that Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa put his palm on  
the head of Swami Vivekananda and that the latter had transcendental  
experience. Could you not do some such thing for me.   
Bhagavan smiled and said: Yes, scriptures speak of such dikshas (initiations)  
and hastha diksha is one of them. **But that too is a limitation. When a  
mighty river runs overflowing its banks, why divert it into a particular  
channel? Let all those who are thirsty drink to their heart 's content and  
capacity.**   
\-- Quotations and Conversations Found in the Ramana Pictorial Souvenir, 1967

2) Talks With Ramana Maharshi Book  
http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/forum/index.php?topic=4872.0   
Even kavyakanta for that matter is not fully realised which means he is not  
always having pure consciousness.   
Quote  
Though a sincere sadhak, Sastri laid his hands on too many pots.   
Politics, Spiritual upliftment of Indians through mantra japas,   
Congress committee work, visiting various holy places, (he had   
visited 55 temples or holy places in India). His Sankalpas were   
many and strong. When Bhagavan Ramana was informed of his   
passing away, and when someone at that time, asked Him, whether   
Sastri had attained liberation, Bhagavan Ramana said: "How can   
it be, he had many sankalpas.

Dear prasanth,   
I brought Swami Vivekananda and Kavyakanta Ganapati Sastri   
only to show their universal consciousness. I am not sure whether   
he had it permanently or temporarily. But Kavyakanta, as Bhagavan   
Ramana said in Verse 80 of AAMM, had the glimpse of transcendence,   
of pure nirvikalpa samadhi. He had this glimpses on many occasions   
in Tiruvannamalai.

For Bhagavan everything was happening on itself like a cloud in the sky. It is  
the truth. Because He understood the truth and He was (is now also) witnessing  
whereas due to ignorance we think I am eating, sleeping, walking and I am  
suffering. We are not witnessing the happenings. Is it? This is my  
understanding.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. Bhagavan Ramana was "experiencing" the future as if it is   
"present", because He ever lives in the 'present'. Actually, it is   
not 'visualizing' that is "seeing something happening in future".   
He never saw anything, because He is the Eye of the eye.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Who am I?: "To keep the mind ever   
abiding in Atma is true Jnana Dhrishti. Knowing what is happening in a far  
off place, or knowing someone else's mind, or knowing the past, present and

Dear srkudai,   
The 'I' which states I am agitated, is the mind or the ego. That is   
why Pure Consciousness is said to be beyond mind-consciousness.

Dear everyone,   
The discussions came for the purpose of knowing and understanding   
the Universal Consciousness. I shall illustrate Universal Consciousness with  
three examples.   
1\. Swami Vivekananda [after his return from America] was staying   
in Belur Math. During a night, he had no proper sleep. He was turning from  
side to side during the night, and this was noticed by some devotees, who were  
lying in the adjacent room. In the morning, they asked Swami for the reasons  
for restless sleep. Swami Vivekananda then explained: "I think there is  
something seriously wrong somewhere in the world. I could sense people crying  
and running!" The morning newspapers carried a headline story where it was  
reported that there was an earthquake in South America and thousands had been  
killed and some more thousands had been injured. The book of SRK Math has  
described the story and also called it as Universal Consciousness. Not  
everyone gets such a sense of a danger happening elsewhere in the world. This  
is   
Pure Consciousness which pervades the whole universe.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana was sitting in the Hall. Devotees were   
vociferously discussing the war news. Nazi forces had captured   
Paris in 4 days and were relentlessly bombing London. [Eagles   
Over London]. The defeat of Allied Forces was expected to happen soon. At  
that time, Russia [later Soviet Union] had not participated   
in the war as yet. Bhagavan Ramana said: 'Eh, but Russia....' He   
did not continue the sentence. Within 6 months, Russia had joined the war,  
and an angry Nazi forces moved towards Russia and were   
nearing Stalingrad. But the Nazi forces could not put up with the   
biting cold of Russia and were limping with handicaps of fever, shivering, and  
other problems of food etc., The Nazi forces thus   
lost the battle of Stalingrad. Soon Russia started their march towards Berlin  
and the Allied forces including Russia invaded Germany and Berlin was  
bombarded. The Allied Forces won the   
second world war. Bhagavan through His universal consciouness,   
could visualize this scenario but did not want to say anything in   
detail.   
3\. Once Kavyakanta said that the town of Tiruvannamalai is like   
a Sri Chakra and soon a town-ship would evolve around this Asramam. This was  
smilingly concurred with by Bhagavan too.   
In another 15 years, Ramana Nagar developed. The Westerners   
built cottages on either side of the Asramam.   
The Universal Consciousness is Pure Consciousness, where the   
Pure Mind pervades the whole universe. Our consciousness which   
is impure, ego-covered, cannot visualize such things concerning the   
whole universe.   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian garu,   
You said vivekananda has pure consciousness.Can you please let us know if he  
had pure consciousness always?   
Once bhagavan ramana when asked about swami vivekananda he said as below   
Quote  
30th September, 1936   
 **Talk 252.**   
D.: Sri Ramakrishna touched Vivekananda and the latter realised Bliss. Is it  
possible?   
M.: Sri Ramakrishna did not touch all for that purpose. He did not create  
Atma. He did not create Realisation. **Vivekananda was ripe.He was anxious to  
realise. He must have completed the preliminary course in his past births.  
Such is possible for ripe persons only.**   
D.: Can the same miracle be worked for all?   
M.: If they are fit. Fitness is the point. A strong man controls the weaker  
man. **A strong mind controls the weaker mind. That was what happened in the  
case cited. The effect was only temporary. Why did Vivekananda not sit quiet?  
Why did he wander about after such a miracle? Because the effect was only  
temporary.**   
Source: TALKS WITH SRI RAMANA MAHARSHI Book   
Devotee: Bhagavan, it is said that Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa put his palm on  
the head of Swami Vivekananda and that the latter had transcendental  
experience. Could you not do some such thing for me.   
Bhagavan smiled and said: Yes, scriptures speak of such dikshas (initiations)  
and hastha diksha is one of them. **But that too is a limitation. When a  
mighty river runs overflowing its banks, why divert it into a particular  
channel? Let all those who are thirsty drink to their heart 's content and  
capacity.**

Even kavyakanta for that matter is not fully realised which means he is not  
always having pure consciousness.   
Quote  
Though a sincere sadhak, Sastri laid his hands on too many pots.   
Politics, Spiritual upliftment of Indians through mantra japas,   
Congress committee work, visiting various holy places, (he had   
visited 55 temples or holy places in India). His Sankalpas were   
many and strong. When Bhagavan Ramana was informed of his   
passing away, and when someone at that time, asked Him, whether   
Sastri had attained liberation, Bhagavan Ramana said: "How can   
it be, he had many sankalpas.

Dear prasanth,   
I brought Swami Vivekananda and Kavyakanta Ganapati Sastri   
only to show their universal consciousness. I am not sure whether   
he had it permanently or temporarily. But Kavyakanta, as Bhagavan   
Ramana said in Verse 80 of AAMM, had the glimpse of transcendence,   
of pure nirvikalpa samadhi. He had this glimpses on many occasions   
in Tiruvannamalai.

For Bhagavan everything was happening on itself like a cloud in the sky. It is  
the truth. Because He understood the truth and He was (is now also) witnessing  
whereas due to ignorance we think I am eating, sleeping, walking and I am  
suffering. We are not witnessing the happenings. Is it? This is my  
understanding.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. Bhagavan Ramana was "experiencing" the future as if it is   
"present", because He ever lives in the 'present'. Actually, it is   
not 'visualizing' that is "seeing something happening in future".   
He never saw anything, because He is the Eye of the eye.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Who am I?: "To keep the mind ever   
abiding in Atma is true Jnana Dhrishti. Knowing what is happening in a far  
off place, or knowing someone else's mind, or knowing the past, present and  
future are not Jnana Dhrishti.   
Arunachala Siva.

Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 01, 2010, 08:19:45 PM

Dear srkudai,   
Yes. I agree Consciousness is both Bhagavan Ramana and we. But   
our consciousness, is more often than not, mind-consciousness,   
ego-consciousness and world consciousness. Bhagavan Ramana is   
ever, eternally unchanging Pure Consciousness. It is pure because   
it is without mind/ego and the world. Even we taste this Pure   
Consciousness, with our mind curling up with the Self in deep sleep.   
If we are denied, even these few hours of sleep everyday, we shall all go mad,  
because the mind and the world is too much with us.   
Murugnar covers these aspects in his Guru Vachaka Kovai verses: Verse 967: Iswara, the Atma Swarupam, while remaining beyond   
mind-consciousness and shining free from attributes and limitations, assumes  
thee two [attributes and limitations] through pure maya, and then appears in  
the very visible form of the physical Guru in order to bestow His grace on  
devotees. His grace is only   
the Being-Consciousness that shines unbroken as 'I-I' in the stillness [that  
is experienced ] when the ego subsides in the Heart,   
its Source, by enquiry, with its attention turned towards the Self.   
Verse 985: In truth, only the Self, Pure Consciousness, causes the  
appearances of all imaginary differences by appearing as the illusory limited  
consciousness. Therefore, true Jnanis who have known and attained through  
enquiry the Self that shines equally   
in everything, all those other things are wholly Self [tanmaya].   
Verse 1009: The eternal state, the refuge where one rests free   
from the weariness of wandering hither and thither in distress, is the  
wondrous turiya firmament, Sivam, the Self Supreme, which flouishes as the  
undivided being consciousness and is revealed by   
the Jnana Guru.   
Verse 1010: If you abide unshakeably in the Self, that state will destroy the  
bond created by sankalpas, like a snake shuffling of its slough. When you  
persevere, abiding in such nishta [Self abidance] to the very end, that which  
manifests is the absolutely empty firmament of Pure Consciousness.   
Verse 1036: Since the dualistic differences do not, in truth, exist, the Self  
is only the being that is perfectly Pure Consciounsess which is entirely free  
from any trace of knowledge and ignorance. In that Self, the Brahma Swarupam  
that is intense Prajnana, know that there is not even a trace of ignorance.   
Verse 1037: If the Self does not exist as being-consciousness, how can the  
diverse vijnana differences [knowledge of specific things] arise in it?  
Therefore that Brahman, the Self is not only free from ignorance, but is  
itself the Swarupam, the Transcendental Consciousness.   
Verse 1046: It exists as the extremely subtle light of being consciousness;  
it is without the rising of the ego that objectively   
knows 'alien' objects as 'this'. Trying to know it, the intellect, the jiva  
bodha, grows exhausted and laments, 'I have not known it'.   
It is concentrated mauna. Such is the Self, being consciousness.   
Verse 1058: Because of the excellence of the Swarupam, the oneness in which  
the seer himself becomes the seeing, one's   
real nature is the most exalted. The 'I' nature, the mauna-light   
in which the ego, the seer 'I' has completely died, is the Self,   
Consciousness the Supreme.   
Verse 1059: The Swarupam that is the abode of the bliss of consciousness is  
the vast ocean and deep ocean of intense   
peace. Those who dive deep within by merging their minds in the Heart, will  
attain the eternal and inexhaustible treasure of he grace of the Self.   
Verse 1064: You should know that 'I' the form of consciousness, by enquiring  
'Who am I?' with calm deliberation, and then get absorbed in your Swarupam,  
consciousness. What purpose is served instead by separating yourself from  
that consciousness, deluding yourself by taking yourself to be the chidabhasa,  
the mind-form dwelling in the ruinous sense objects and suffering?   
Verse 1115: The Jnani knows the entire world that appears in consciousness as  
Pure Consciousness alone. Realizing that the world has no independent reality  
apart from Consciousness, he will abide calmly in the Self. He is the wealthy  
and fortunate one.   
Verse 1117: The Swarupam alone exists in the Swarupam, the nondual fullness  
that is Pure Consciousnes and supreme grace.   
Within it the differences of the 'I' [the seer] and 'this' [the seen]   
do not exist. Therefore, those whose minds have dived deep in that fullness  
will not suffer and lament in the false life of duality that is an imaginary  
appearance.   
Verse 1222: That which shines as the residue is the peace that is wholly  
consciousness. That indeed is the eternal Sivam. That residue, the  
consummate supreme, is aham _, the ego-free mauna that is the culmination of  
liberation.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 You have put it nicely. There being only consciousness. .. we see its reflection in the mind. .. the reflection is seen as changing due to ripples and we think consciousness is changing. its purely the reflection that is changing.   
Consciousness is every Self.   
there is really no mind-consciousness. the mind functions in the presence of  
consciousness and we seem to somehow associate mind forms with consciousness  
... this we should stop.   
its like my mind is calm and i feel i am calm.   
my mind is full of thoughts, i think i have thoughts.   
just a point that needs consideration: if mind is full of agitations, how can  
we say i am agitated, since i am consciousness and not the mind!!

Dear prasanth,   
I brought Swami Vivekananda and Kavyakanta Ganapati Sastri   
only to show their universal consciousness. I am not sure whether   
he had it permanently or temporarily. But Kavyakanta, as Bhagavan

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. Bhagavan Ramana was "experiencing" the future as if it is   
"present", because He ever lives in the 'present'. Actually, it is   
not 'visualizing' that is "seeing something happening in future".   
He never saw anything, because He is the Eye of the eye.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Who am I?: "To keep the mind ever   
abiding in Atma is true Jnana Dhrishti. Knowing what is happening in a far  
off place, or knowing someone else's mind, or knowing the past, present and  
future are not Jnana Dhrishti.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai,   
Yes. I agree Consciousness is both Bhagavan Ramana and we. But   
our consciousness, is more often than not, mind-consciousness,   
ego-consciousness and world consciousness. Bhagavan Ramana is   
ever, eternally unchanging Pure Consciousness. It is pure because   
it is without mind/ego and the world. Even we taste this Pure   
Consciousness, with our mind curling up with the Self in deep sleep.   
If we are denied, even these few hours of sleep everyday, we shall all go mad,  
because the mind and the world is too much with us.   
Murugnar covers these aspects in his Guru Vachaka Kovai verses: Verse 967: Iswara, the Atma Swarupam, while remaining beyond   
mind-consciousness and shining free from attributes and limitations, assumes  
thee two [attributes and limitations] through pure maya, and then appears in  
the very visible form of the physical Guru in order to bestow His grace on  
devotees. His grace is only   
the Being-Consciousness that shines unbroken as 'I-I' in the stillness [that  
is experienced ] when the ego subsides in the Heart,   
its Source, by enquiry, with its attention turned towards the Self.   
Verse 985: In truth, only the Self, Pure Consciousness, causes the  
appearances of all imaginary differences by appearing as the illusory limited  
consciousness. Therefore, true Jnanis who have known and attained through  
enquiry the Self that shines equally   
in everything, all those other things are wholly Self [tanmaya].   
Verse 1009: The eternal state, the refuge where one rests free   
from the weariness of wandering hither and thither in distress, is the  
wondrous turiya firmament, Sivam, the Self Supreme, which flouishes as the  
undivided being consciousness and is revealed by   
the Jnana Guru.   
Verse 1010: If you abide unshakeably in the Self, that state will destroy the  
bond created by sankalpas, like a snake shuffling of its slough. When you  
persevere, abiding in such nishta [Self abidance] to the very end, that which  
manifests is the absolutely empty firmament of Pure Consciousness.   
Verse 1036: Since the dualistic differences do not, in truth, exist, the Self  
is only the being that is perfectly Pure Consciounsess which is entirely free  
from any trace of knowledge and ignorance. In that Self, the Brahma Swarupam  
that is intense Prajnana, know that there is not even a trace of ignorance.   
Verse 1037: If the Self does not exist as being-consciousness, how can the  
diverse vijnana differences [knowledge of specific things] arise in it?  
Therefore that Brahman, the Self is not only free from ignorance, but is  
itself the Swarupam, the Transcendental Consciousness.   
Verse 1046: It exists as the extremely subtle light of being consciousness;  
it is without the rising of the ego that objectively   
knows 'alien' objects as 'this'. Trying to know it, the intellect, the jiva  
bodha, grows exhausted and laments, 'I have not known it'.   
It is concentrated mauna. Such is the Self, being consciousness.   
Verse 1058: Because of the excellence of the Swarupam, the oneness in which  
the seer himself becomes the seeing, one's   
real nature is the most exalted. The 'I' nature, the mauna-light   
in which the ego, the seer 'I' has completely died, is the Self,   
Consciousness the Supreme.   
Verse 1059: The Swarupam that is the abode of the bliss of consciousness is  
the vast ocean and deep ocean of intense   
peace. Those who dive deep within by merging their minds in the Heart, will  
attain the eternal and inexhaustible treasure of he grace of the Self.   
Verse 1064: You should know that 'I' the form of consciousness, by enquiring  
'Who am I?' with calm deliberation, and then get absorbed in your Swarupam,  
consciousness. What purpose is served instead by separating yourself from  
that consciousness, deluding yourself by taking yourself to be the chidabhasa,  
the mind-form dwelling in the ruinous sense objects and suffering?   
Verse 1115: The Jnani knows the entire world that appears in consciousness as  
Pure Consciousness alone. Realizing that the world has no independent reality  
apart from Consciousness, he will abide calmly in the Self. He is the wealthy  
and fortunate one.   
Verse 1117: The Swarupam alone exists in the Swarupam, the nondual fullness  
that is Pure Consciousnes and supreme grace.   
Within it the differences of the 'I' [the seer] and 'this' [the seen]   
do not exist. Therefore, those whose minds have dived deep in that fullness  
will not suffer and lament in the false life of duality that is an imaginary  
appearance.   
Verse 1222: That which shines as the residue is the peace that is wholly  
consciousness. That indeed is the eternal Sivam. That residue, the  
consummate supreme, is aham _, the ego-free mauna that is the culmination of  
liberation.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 You have put it nicely. There being only consciousness. .. we see its reflection in the mind. .. the reflection is seen as changing due to ripples and we think consciousness is changing. its purely the reflection that is changing.   
Consciousness is every Self.   
there is really no mind-consciousness. the mind functions in the presence of  
consciousness and we seem to somehow associate mind forms with consciousness  
... this we should stop.   
its like my mind is calm and i feel i am calm.   
my mind is full of thoughts, i think i have thoughts.   
just a point that needs consideration: if mind is full of agitations, how can  
we say i am agitated, since i am consciousness and not the mind!!

Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 02, 2010, 10:15:36 AM

Dear everyone,   
The discussions came for the purpose of knowing and understanding   
the Universal Consciousness. I shall illustrate Universal Consciousness with  
three examples.   
1\. Swami Vivekananda [after his return from America] was staying   
in Belur Math. During a night, he had no proper sleep. He was turning from  
side to side during the night, and this was noticed by some devotees, who were  
lying in the adjacent room. In the morning, they asked Swami for the reasons  
for restless sleep. Swami Vivekananda then explained: "I think there is  
something seriously wrong somewhere in the world. I could sense people crying  
and running!" The morning newspapers carried a headline story where it was  
reported that there was an earthquake in South America and thousands had been  
killed and some more thousands had been injured. The book of SRK Math has  
described the story and also called it as Universal Consciousness. Not  
everyone gets such a sense of a danger happening elsewhere in the world. This  
is   
Pure Consciousness which pervades the whole universe.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana was sitting in the Hall. Devotees were   
vociferously discussing the war news. Nazi forces had captured   
Paris in 4 days and were relentlessly bombing London. [Eagles   
Over London]. The defeat of Allied Forces was expected to happen soon. At  
that time, Russia [later Soviet Union] had not participated   
in the war as yet. Bhagavan Ramana said: 'Eh, but Russia....' He   
did not continue the sentence. Within 6 months, Russia had joined the war,  
and an angry Nazi forces moved towards Russia and were   
nearing Stalingrad. But the Nazi forces could not put up with the   
biting cold of Russia and were limping with handicaps of fever, shivering, and  
other problems of food etc., The Nazi forces thus   
lost the battle of Stalingrad. Soon Russia started their march towards Berlin  
and the Allied forces including Russia invaded Germany and Berlin was  
bombarded. The Allied Forces won the   
second world war. Bhagavan through His universal consciouness,   
could visualize this scenario but did not want to say anything in   
detail.   
3\. Once Kavyakanta said that the town of Tiruvannamalai is like   
a Sri Chakra and soon a town-ship would evolve around this Asramam. This was  
smilingly concurred with by Bhagavan too.   
In another 15 years, Ramana Nagar developed. The Westerners   
built cottages on either side of the Asramam.   
The Universal Consciousness is Pure Consciousness, where the   
Pure Mind pervades the whole universe. Our consciousness which   
is impure, ego-covered, cannot visualize such things concerning the   
whole universe.   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian garu,   
You said vivekananda has pure consciousness.Can you please let us know if he

Once bhagavan ramana when asked about swami vivekananda he said as below   
Quote  
30th September, 1936   
 **Talk 252.**   
D.: Sri Ramakrishna touched Vivekananda and the latter realised Bliss. Is it  
possible?   
M.: Sri Ramakrishna did not touch all for that purpose. He did not create  
Atma. He did not create Realisation. **Vivekananda was ripe.He was anxious to  
realise. He must have completed the preliminary course in his past births.  
Such is possible for ripe persons only.**   
D.: Can the same miracle be worked for all?   
M.: If they are fit. Fitness is the point. A strong man controls the weaker  
man. **A strong mind controls the weaker mind. That was what happened in the  
case cited. The effect was only temporary. Why did Vivekananda not sit quiet?

mind-consciousness and shining free from attributes and limitations, assumes  
thee two [attributes and limitations] through pure maya, and then appears in  
the very visible form of the physical Guru in order to bestow His grace on  
devotees. His grace is only   
the Being-Consciousness that shines unbroken as 'I-I' in the stillness [that  
is experienced ] when the ego subsides in the Heart,   
its Source, by enquiry, with its attention turned towards the Self.   
Verse 985: In truth, only the Self, Pure Consciousness, causes the  
appearances of all imaginary differences by appearing as the illusory limited  
consciousness. Therefore, true Jnanis who have known and attained through  
enquiry the Self that shines equally   
in everything, all those other things are wholly Self [tanmaya].   
Verse 1009: The eternal state, the refuge where one rests free   
from the weariness of wandering hither and thither in distress, is the  
wondrous turiya firmament, Sivam, the Self Supreme, which flouishes as the  
undivided being consciousness and is revealed by   
the Jnana Guru.   
Verse 1010: If you abide unshakeably in the Self, that state will destroy the  
bond created by sankalpas, like a snake shuffling of its slough. When you  
persevere, abiding in such nishta [Self abidance] to the very end, that which  
manifests is the absolutely empty firmament of Pure Consciousness.   
Verse 1036: Since the dualistic differences do not, in truth, exist, the Self  
is only the being that is perfectly Pure Consciounsess which is entirely free  
from any trace of knowledge and ignorance. In that Self, the Brahma Swarupam  
that is intense Prajnana, know that there is not even a trace of ignorance.   
Verse 1037: If the Self does not exist as being-consciousness, how can the  
diverse vijnana differences [knowledge of specific things] arise in it?  
Therefore that Brahman, the Self is not only free from ignorance, but is  
itself the Swarupam, the Transcendental Consciousness.   
Verse 1046: It exists as the extremely subtle light of being consciousness;  
it is without the rising of the ego that objectively   
knows 'alien' objects as 'this'. Trying to know it, the intellect, the jiva  
bodha, grows exhausted and laments, 'I have not known it'.   
It is concentrated mauna. Such is the Self, being consciousness.   
Verse 1058: Because of the excellence of the Swarupam, the oneness in which  
the seer himself becomes the seeing, one's   
real nature is the most exalted. The 'I' nature, the mauna-light   
in which the ego, the seer 'I' has completely died, is the Self,   
Consciousness the Supreme.   
Verse 1059: The Swarupam that is the abode of the bliss of consciousness is  
the vast ocean and deep ocean of intense   
peace. Those who dive deep within by merging their minds in the Heart, will  
attain the eternal and inexhaustible treasure of he grace of the Self.   
Verse 1064: You should know that 'I' the form of consciousness, by enquiring  
'Who am I?' with calm deliberation, and then get absorbed in your Swarupam,  
consciousness. What purpose is served instead by separating yourself from  
that consciousness, deluding yourself by taking yourself to be the chidabhasa,  
the mind-form dwelling in the ruinous sense objects and suffering?   
Verse 1115: The Jnani knows the entire world that appears in consciousness as  
Pure Consciousness alone. Realizing that the world has no independent reality  
apart from Consciousness, he will abide calmly in the Self. He is the wealthy  
and fortunate one.   
Verse 1117: The Swarupam alone exists in the Swarupam, the nondual fullness  
that is Pure Consciousnes and supreme grace.   
Within it the differences of the 'I' [the seer] and 'this' [the seen]   
do not exist. Therefore, those whose minds have dived deep in that fullness  
will not suffer and lament in the false life of duality that is an imaginary  
appearance.   
Verse 1222: That which shines as the residue is the peace that is wholly  
consciousness. That indeed is the eternal Sivam. That residue, the  
consummate supreme, is aham _, the ego-free mauna that is the culmination of  
liberation.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 You have put it nicely. There being only consciousness. .. we see its reflection in the mind. .. the reflection is seen as changing due to ripples and we think consciousness is changing. its purely the reflection that is changing.   
Consciousness is every Self.

Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 02, 2010, 10:15:36 AM

Dear everyone,   
The discussions came for the purpose of knowing and understanding   
the Universal Consciousness. I shall illustrate Universal Consciousness with  
three examples.   
1\. Swami Vivekananda [after his return from America] was staying   
in Belur Math. During a night, he had no proper sleep. He was turning from  
side to side during the night, and this was noticed by some devotees, who were  
lying in the adjacent room. In the morning, they asked Swami for the reasons  
for restless sleep. Swami Vivekananda then explained: "I think there is  
something seriously wrong somewhere in the world. I could sense people crying  
and running!" The morning newspapers carried a headline story where it was  
reported that there was an earthquake in South America and thousands had been  
killed and some more thousands had been injured. The book of SRK Math has  
described the story and also called it as Universal Consciousness. Not  
everyone gets such a sense of a danger happening elsewhere in the world. This  
is   
Pure Consciousness which pervades the whole universe.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana was sitting in the Hall. Devotees were   
vociferously discussing the war news. Nazi forces had captured   
Paris in 4 days and were relentlessly bombing London. [Eagles   
Over London]. The defeat of Allied Forces was expected to happen soon. At  
that time, Russia [later Soviet Union] had not participated   
in the war as yet. Bhagavan Ramana said: 'Eh, but Russia....' He   
did not continue the sentence. Within 6 months, Russia had joined the war,  
and an angry Nazi forces moved towards Russia and were   
nearing Stalingrad. But the Nazi forces could not put up with the   
biting cold of Russia and were limping with handicaps of fever, shivering, and  
other problems of food etc., The Nazi forces thus   
lost the battle of Stalingrad. Soon Russia started their march towards Berlin  
and the Allied forces including Russia invaded Germany and Berlin was  
bombarded. The Allied Forces won the   
second world war. Bhagavan through His universal consciouness,   
could visualize this scenario but did not want to say anything in   
detail.   
3\. Once Kavyakanta said that the town of Tiruvannamalai is like   
a Sri Chakra and soon a town-ship would evolve around this Asramam. This was  
smilingly concurred with by Bhagavan too.   
In another 15 years, Ramana Nagar developed. The Westerners   
built cottages on either side of the Asramam.   
The Universal Consciousness is Pure Consciousness, where the   
Pure Mind pervades the whole universe. Our consciousness which   
is impure, ego-covered, cannot visualize such things concerning the   
whole universe.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 these are powers. they belong to the mind. coz they pertain to the mithya world.   
There is absolutely no difference between universal consciousness and normal  
consciousness.

well said udai garu.   
There is no difference between universal consciousness and normal  
consciousness.   
Subramanian garu,   
You said vivekananda has pure consciousness.Can you please let us know if he  
had pure consciousness always?   
Once bhagavan ramana when asked about swami vivekananda he said as below   
Quote  
30th September, 1936   
 **Talk 252.**   
D.: Sri Ramakrishna touched Vivekananda and the latter realised Bliss. Is it  
possible?   
M.: Sri Ramakrishna did not touch all for that purpose. He did not create  
Atma. He did not create Realisation. **Vivekananda was ripe.He was anxious to  
realise. He must have completed the preliminary course in his past births.  
Such is possible for ripe persons only.**   
D.: Can the same miracle be worked for all?   
M.: If they are fit. Fitness is the point. A strong man controls the weaker  
man. **A strong mind controls the weaker mind. That was what happened in the  
case cited. The effect was only temporary. Why did Vivekananda not sit quiet?  
Why did he wander about after such a miracle? Because the effect was only  
temporary.**   
Source: TALKS WITH SRI RAMANA MAHARSHI Book   
Devotee: Bhagavan, it is said that Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa put his palm on  
the head of Swami Vivekananda and that the latter had transcendental  
experience. Could you not do some such thing for me.   
Bhagavan smiled and said: Yes, scriptures speak of such dikshas (initiations)  
and hastha diksha is one of them. **But that too is a limitation. When a  
mighty river runs overflowing its banks, why divert it into a particular  
channel? Let all those who are thirsty drink to their heart 's content and  
capacity.**   
\-- Quotations and Conversations Found in the Ramana Pictorial Souvenir, 1967

2) Talks With Ramana Maharshi Book  
http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/forum/index.php?topic=4872.0   
Even kavyakanta for that matter is not fully realised which means he is not  
always having pure consciousness.   
Quote  
Though a sincere sadhak, Sastri laid his hands on too many pots.   
Politics, Spiritual upliftment of Indians through mantra japas,   
Congress committee work, visiting various holy places, (he had   
visited 55 temples or holy places in India). His Sankalpas were   
many and strong. When Bhagavan Ramana was informed of his   
passing away, and when someone at that time, asked Him, whether   
Sastri had attained liberation, Bhagavan Ramana said: "How can   
it be, he had many sankalpas.

Dear prasanth,   
I brought Swami Vivekananda and Kavyakanta Ganapati Sastri   
only to show their universal consciousness. I am not sure whether   
he had it permanently or temporarily. But Kavyakanta, as Bhagavan   
Ramana said in Verse 80 of AAMM, had the glimpse of transcendence,   
of pure nirvikalpa samadhi. He had this glimpses on many occasions   
in Tiruvannamalai.

For Bhagavan everything was happening on itself like a cloud in the sky. It is  
the truth. Because He understood the truth and He was (is now also) witnessing  
whereas due to ignorance we think I am eating, sleeping, walking and I am  
suffering. We are not witnessing the happenings. Is it? This is my  
understanding.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. Bhagavan Ramana was "experiencing" the future as if it is   
"present", because He ever lives in the 'present'. Actually, it is   
not 'visualizing' that is "seeing something happening in future".   
He never saw anything, because He is the Eye of the eye.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Who am I?: "To keep the mind ever   
abiding in Atma is true Jnana Dhrishti. Knowing what is happening in a far  
off place, or knowing someone else's mind, or knowing the past, present and  
future are not Jnana Dhrishti.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai,   
Yes. I agree Consciousness is both Bhagavan Ramana and we. But   
our consciousness, is more often than not, mind-consciousness,   
ego-consciousness and world consciousness. Bhagavan Ramana is   
ever, eternally unchanging Pure Consciousness. It is pure because   
it is without mind/ego and the world. Even we taste this Pure   
Consciousness, with our mind curling up with the Self in deep sleep.   
If we are denied, even these few hours of sleep everyday, we shall all go mad,  
because the mind and the world is too much with us.   
Murugnar covers these aspects in his Guru Vachaka Kovai verses: Verse 967: Iswara, the Atma Swarupam, while remaining beyond   
mind-consciousness and shining free from attributes and limitations, assumes

## Re:[20] Universal Consciousness: Beyond all limitations  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 02, 2010, 10:15:36 AM

Dear everyone,   
The discussions came for the purpose of knowing and understanding   
the Universal Consciousness. I shall illustrate Universal Consciousness with  
three examples.   
1\. Swami Vivekananda [after his return from America] was staying   
in Belur Math. During a night, he had no proper sleep. He was turning from  
side to side during the night, and this was noticed by some devotees, who were  
lying in the adjacent room. In the morning, they asked Swami for the reasons  
for restless sleep. Swami Vivekananda then explained: "I think there is  
something seriously wrong somewhere in the world. I could sense people crying  
and running!" The morning newspapers carried a headline story where it was  
reported that there was an earthquake in South America and thousands had been  
killed and some more thousands had been injured. The book of SRK Math has  
described the story and also called it as Universal Consciousness. Not  
everyone gets such a sense of a danger happening elsewhere in the world. This  
is   
Pure Consciousness which pervades the whole universe.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana was sitting in the Hall. Devotees were   
vociferously discussing the war news. Nazi forces had captured   
Paris in 4 days and were relentlessly bombing London. [Eagles   
Over London]. The defeat of Allied Forces was expected to happen soon. At  
that time, Russia [later Soviet Union] had not participated   
in the war as yet. Bhagavan Ramana said: 'Eh, but Russia....' He   
did not continue the sentence. Within 6 months, Russia had joined the war,  
and an angry Nazi forces moved towards Russia and were   
nearing Stalingrad. But the Nazi forces could not put up with the   
biting cold of Russia and were limping with handicaps of fever, shivering, and  
other problems of food etc., The Nazi forces thus   
lost the battle of Stalingrad. Soon Russia started their march towards Berlin  
and the Allied forces including Russia invaded Germany and Berlin was  
bombarded. The Allied Forces won the   
second world war. Bhagavan through His universal consciouness,   
could visualize this scenario but did not want to say anything in   
detail.   
3\. Once Kavyakanta said that the town of Tiruvannamalai is like   
a Sri Chakra and soon a town-ship would evolve around this Asramam. This was  
smilingly concurred with by Bhagavan too.   
In another 15 years, Ramana Nagar developed. The Westerners   
built cottages on either side of the Asramam.   
The Universal Consciousness is Pure Consciousness, where the   
Pure Mind pervades the whole universe. Our consciousness which   
is impure, ego-covered, cannot visualize such things concerning the   
whole universe.   
Arunachala Siva.

D.: Sri Ramakrishna touched Vivekananda and the latter realised Bliss. Is it  
possible?   
M.: Sri Ramakrishna did not touch all for that purpose. He did not create  
Atma. He did not create Realisation. **Vivekananda was ripe.He was anxious to  
realise. He must have completed the preliminary course in his past births.  
Such is possible for ripe persons only.**   
D.: Can the same miracle be worked for all?   
M.: If they are fit. Fitness is the point. A strong man controls the weaker  
man. **A strong mind controls the weaker mind. That was what happened in the  
case cited. The effect was only temporary. Why did Vivekananda not sit quiet?  
Why did he wander about after such a miracle? Because the effect was only  
temporary.**   
Source: TALKS WITH SRI RAMANA MAHARSHI Book   
Devotee: Bhagavan, it is said that Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa put his palm on  
the head of Swami Vivekananda and that the latter had transcendental  
experience. Could you not do some such thing for me.   
Bhagavan smiled and said: Yes, scriptures speak of such dikshas (initiations)  
and hastha diksha is one of them. **But that too is a limitation. When a  
mighty river runs overflowing its banks, why divert it into a particular  
channel? Let all those who are thirsty drink to their heart 's content and  
capacity.**

Even kavyakanta for that matter is not fully realised which means he is not  
always having pure consciousness.   
Quote  
Though a sincere sadhak, Sastri laid his hands on too many pots.   
Politics, Spiritual upliftment of Indians through mantra japas,   
Congress committee work, visiting various holy places, (he had   
visited 55 temples or holy places in India). His Sankalpas were   
many and strong. When Bhagavan Ramana was informed of his   
passing away, and when someone at that time, asked Him, whether   
Sastri had attained liberation, Bhagavan Ramana said: "How can   
it be, he had many sankalpas.

Dear prasanth,   
I brought Swami Vivekananda and Kavyakanta Ganapati Sastri   
only to show their universal consciousness. I am not sure whether   
he had it permanently or temporarily. But Kavyakanta, as Bhagavan   
Ramana said in Verse 80 of AAMM, had the glimpse of transcendence,   
of pure nirvikalpa samadhi. He had this glimpses on many occasions   
in Tiruvannamalai.

For Bhagavan everything was happening on itself like a cloud in the sky. It is  
the truth. Because He understood the truth and He was (is now also) witnessing  
whereas due to ignorance we think I am eating, sleeping, walking and I am  
suffering. We are not witnessing the happenings. Is it? This is my  
understanding.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. Bhagavan Ramana was "experiencing" the future as if it is   
"present", because He ever lives in the 'present'. Actually, it is   
not 'visualizing' that is "seeing something happening in future".   
He never saw anything, because He is the Eye of the eye.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Who am I?: "To keep the mind ever   
abiding in Atma is true Jnana Dhrishti. Knowing what is happening in a far  
off place, or knowing someone else's mind, or knowing the past, present and  
future are not Jnana Dhrishti.   
Arunachala Siva.

Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 01, 2010, 08:19:45 PM

Dear srkudai,   
Yes. I agree Consciousness is both Bhagavan Ramana and we. But   
our consciousness, is more often than not, mind-consciousness,   
ego-consciousness and world consciousness. Bhagavan Ramana is   
ever, eternally unchanging Pure Consciousness. It is pure because   
it is without mind/ego and the world. Even we taste this Pure   
Consciousness, with our mind curling up with the Self in deep sleep.   
If we are denied, even these few hours of sleep everyday, we shall all go mad,  
because the mind and the world is too much with us.   
Murugnar covers these aspects in his Guru Vachaka Kovai verses: Verse 967: Iswara, the Atma Swarupam, while remaining beyond   
mind-consciousness and shining free from attributes and limitations, assumes  
thee two [attributes and limitations] through pure maya, and then appears in  
the very visible form of the physical Guru in order to bestow His grace on  
devotees. His grace is only   
the Being-Consciousness that shines unbroken as 'I-I' in the stillness [that  
is experienced ] when the ego subsides in the Heart,   
its Source, by enquiry, with its attention turned towards the Self.   
Verse 985: In truth, only the Self, Pure Consciousness, causes the  
appearances of all imaginary differences by appearing as the illusory limited  
consciousness. Therefore, true Jnanis who have known and attained through  
enquiry the Self that shines equally   
in everything, all those other things are wholly Self [tanmaya].   
Verse 1009: The eternal state, the refuge where one rests free   
from the weariness of wandering hither and thither in distress, is the  
wondrous turiya firmament, Sivam, the Self Supreme, which flouishes as the  
undivided being consciousness and is revealed by   
the Jnana Guru.   
Verse 1010: If you abide unshakeably in the Self, that state will destroy the  
bond created by sankalpas, like a snake shuffling of its slough. When you  
persevere, abiding in such nishta [Self abidance] to the very end, that which  
manifests is the absolutely empty firmament of Pure Consciousness.   
Verse 1036: Since the dualistic differences do not, in truth, exist, the Self  
is only the being that is perfectly Pure Consciounsess which is entirely free  
from any trace of knowledge and ignorance. In that Self, the Brahma Swarupam  
that is intense Prajnana, know that there is not even a trace of ignorance.   
Verse 1037: If the Self does not exist as being-consciousness, how can the  
diverse vijnana differences [knowledge of specific things] arise in it?  
Therefore that Brahman, the Self is not only free from ignorance, but is  
itself the Swarupam, the Transcendental Consciousness.   
Verse 1046: It exists as the extremely subtle light of being consciousness;  
it is without the rising of the ego that objectively   
knows 'alien' objects as 'this'. Trying to know it, the intellect, the jiva  
bodha, grows exhausted and laments, 'I have not known it'.   
It is concentrated mauna. Such is the Self, being consciousness.   
Verse 1058: Because of the excellence of the Swarupam, the oneness in which  
the seer himself becomes the seeing, one's   
real nature is the most exalted. The 'I' nature, the mauna-light   
in which the ego, the seer 'I' has completely died, is the Self,   
Consciousness the Supreme.   
Verse 1059: The Swarupam that is the abode of the bliss of consciousness is  
the vast ocean and deep ocean of intense   
peace. Those who dive deep within by merging their minds in the Heart, will  
attain the eternal and inexhaustible treasure of he grace of the Self.   
Verse 1064: You should know that 'I' the form of consciousness, by enquiring  
'Who am I?' with calm deliberation, and then get absorbed in your Swarupam,  
consciousness. What purpose is served instead by separating yourself from  
that consciousness, deluding yourself by taking yourself to be the chidabhasa,  
the mind-form dwelling in the ruinous sense objects and suffering?   
Verse 1115: The Jnani knows the entire world that appears in consciousness as  
Pure Consciousness alone. Realizing that the world has no independent reality  
apart from Consciousness, he will abide calmly in the Self. He is the wealthy  
and fortunate one.   
Verse 1117: The Swarupam alone exists in the Swarupam, the nondual fullness  
that is Pure Consciousnes and supreme grace.   
Within it the differences of the 'I' [the seer] and 'this' [the seen]   
do not exist. Therefore, those whose minds have dived deep in that fullness  
will not suffer and lament in the false life of duality that is an imaginary  
appearance.   
Verse 1222: That which shines as the residue is the peace that is wholly  
consciousness. That indeed is the eternal Sivam. That residue, the  
consummate supreme, is aham _, the ego-free mauna that is the culmination of  
liberation.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 You have put it nicely. There being only consciousness. .. we see its reflection in the mind. .. the reflection is seen as changing due to ripples and we think consciousness is changing. its purely the reflection that is changing.   
Consciousness is every Self.   
there is really no mind-consciousness. the mind functions in the presence of  
consciousness and we seem to somehow associate mind forms with consciousness  
... this we should stop.   
its like my mind is calm and i feel i am calm.   
my mind is full of thoughts, i think i have thoughts.   
just a point that needs consideration: if mind is full of agitations, how can  
we say i am agitated, since i am consciousness and not the mind!!

Dear prasanth,   
I brought Swami Vivekananda and Kavyakanta Ganapati Sastri   
only to show their universal consciousness. I am not sure whether   
he had it permanently or temporarily. But Kavyakanta, as Bhagavan   
Ramana said in Verse 80 of AAMM, had the glimpse of transcendence,   
of pure nirvikalpa samadhi. He had this glimpses on many occasions   
in Tiruvannamalai.

For Bhagavan everything was happening on itself like a cloud in the sky. It is  
the truth. Because He understood the truth and He was (is now also) witnessing  
whereas due to ignorance we think I am eating, sleeping, walking and I am  
suffering. We are not witnessing the happenings. Is it? This is my

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. Bhagavan Ramana was "experiencing" the future as if it is   
"present", because He ever lives in the 'present'. Actually, it is   
not 'visualizing' that is "seeing something happening in future".   
He never saw anything, because He is the Eye of the eye.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Who am I?: "To keep the mind ever   
abiding in Atma is true Jnana Dhrishti. Knowing what is happening in a far  
off place, or knowing someone else's mind, or knowing the past, present and  
future are not Jnana Dhrishti.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai,   
Yes. I agree Consciousness is both Bhagavan Ramana and we. But   
our consciousness, is more often than not, mind-consciousness,   
ego-consciousness and world consciousness. Bhagavan Ramana is   
ever, eternally unchanging Pure Consciousness. It is pure because   
it is without mind/ego and the world. Even we taste this Pure   
Consciousness, with our mind curling up with the Self in deep sleep.   
If we are denied, even these few hours of sleep everyday, we shall all go mad,  
because the mind and the world is too much with us.   
Murugnar covers these aspects in his Guru Vachaka Kovai verses: Verse 967: Iswara, the Atma Swarupam, while remaining beyond   
mind-consciousness and shining free from attributes and limitations, assumes  
thee two [attributes and limitations] through pure maya, and then appears in  
the very visible form of the physical Guru in order to bestow His grace on  
devotees. His grace is only   
the Being-Consciousness that shines unbroken as 'I-I' in the stillness [that  
is experienced ] when the ego subsides in the Heart,   
its Source, by enquiry, with its attention turned towards the Self.   
Verse 985: In truth, only the Self, Pure Consciousness, causes the  
appearances of all imaginary differences by appearing as the illusory limited  
consciousness. Therefore, true Jnanis who have known and attained through  
enquiry the Self that shines equally   
in everything, all those other things are wholly Self [tanmaya].   
Verse 1009: The eternal state, the refuge where one rests free   
from the weariness of wandering hither and thither in distress, is the  
wondrous turiya firmament, Sivam, the Self Supreme, which flouishes as the  
undivided being consciousness and is revealed by   
the Jnana Guru.   
Verse 1010: If you abide unshakeably in the Self, that state will destroy the  
bond created by sankalpas, like a snake shuffling of its slough. When you  
persevere, abiding in such nishta [Self abidance] to the very end, that which  
manifests is the absolutely empty firmament of Pure Consciousness.   
Verse 1036: Since the dualistic differences do not, in truth, exist, the Self  
is only the being that is perfectly Pure Consciounsess which is entirely free  
from any trace of knowledge and ignorance. In that Self, the Brahma Swarupam  
that is intense Prajnana, know that there is not even a trace of ignorance.   
Verse 1037: If the Self does not exist as being-consciousness, how can the  
diverse vijnana differences [knowledge of specific things] arise in it?  
Therefore that Brahman, the Self is not only free from ignorance, but is  
itself the Swarupam, the Transcendental Consciousness.   
Verse 1046: It exists as the extremely subtle light of being consciousness;  
it is without the rising of the ego that objectively   
knows 'alien' objects as 'this'. Trying to know it, the intellect, the jiva  
bodha, grows exhausted and laments, 'I have not known it'.   
It is concentrated mauna. Such is the Self, being consciousness.   
Verse 1058: Because of the excellence of the Swarupam, the oneness in which  
the seer himself becomes the seeing, one's   
real nature is the most exalted. The 'I' nature, the mauna-light   
in which the ego, the seer 'I' has completely died, is the Self,   
Consciousness the Supreme.   
Verse 1059: The Swarupam that is the abode of the bliss of consciousness is  
the vast ocean and deep ocean of intense   
peace. Those who dive deep within by merging their minds in the Heart, will  
attain the eternal and inexhaustible treasure of he grace of the Self.   
Verse 1064: You should know that 'I' the form of consciousness, by enquiring  
'Who am I?' with calm deliberation, and then get absorbed in your Swarupam,  
consciousness. What purpose is served instead by separating yourself from  
that consciousness, deluding yourself by taking yourself to be the chidabhasa,  
the mind-form dwelling in the ruinous sense objects and suffering?   
Verse 1115: The Jnani knows the entire world that appears in consciousness as  
Pure Consciousness alone. Realizing that the world has no independent reality  
apart from Consciousness, he will abide calmly in the Self. He is the wealthy  
and fortunate one.   
Verse 1117: The Swarupam alone exists in the Swarupam, the nondual fullness  
that is Pure Consciousnes and supreme grace.   
Within it the differences of the 'I' [the seer] and 'this' [the seen]   
do not exist. Therefore, those whose minds have dived deep in that fullness  
will not suffer and lament in the false life of duality that is an imaginary  
appearance.   
Verse 1222: That which shines as the residue is the peace that is wholly  
consciousness. That indeed is the eternal Sivam. That residue, the  
consummate supreme, is aham _, the ego-free mauna that is the culmination of  
liberation.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 You have put it nicely. There being only consciousness. .. we see its reflection in the mind. .. the reflection is seen as changing due to ripples and we think consciousness is changing. its purely the reflection that is changing.   
Consciousness is every Self.   
there is really no mind-consciousness. the mind functions in the presence of  
consciousness and we seem to somehow associate mind forms with consciousness  
... this we should stop.   
its like my mind is calm and i feel i am calm.   
my mind is full of thoughts, i think i have thoughts.   
just a point that needs consideration: if mind is full of agitations, how can  
we say i am agitated, since i am consciousness and not the mind!!

Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 02, 2010, 10:15:36 AM

Dear everyone,   
The discussions came for the purpose of knowing and understanding   
the Universal Consciousness. I shall illustrate Universal Consciousness with  
three examples.   
1\. Swami Vivekananda [after his return from America] was staying   
in Belur Math. During a night, he had no proper sleep. He was turning from  
side to side during the night, and this was noticed by some devotees, who were  
lying in the adjacent room. In the morning, they asked Swami for the reasons  
for restless sleep. Swami Vivekananda then explained: "I think there is  
something seriously wrong somewhere in the world. I could sense people crying  
and running!" The morning newspapers carried a headline story where it was  
reported that there was an earthquake in South America and thousands had been  
killed and some more thousands had been injured. The book of SRK Math has  
described the story and also called it as Universal Consciousness. Not  
everyone gets such a sense of a danger happening elsewhere in the world. This  
is   
Pure Consciousness which pervades the whole universe.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana was sitting in the Hall. Devotees were   
vociferously discussing the war news. Nazi forces had captured   
Paris in 4 days and were relentlessly bombing London. [Eagles   
Over London]. The defeat of Allied Forces was expected to happen soon. At  
that time, Russia [later Soviet Union] had not participated   
in the war as yet. Bhagavan Ramana said: 'Eh, but Russia....' He   
did not continue the sentence. Within 6 months, Russia had joined the war,  
and an angry Nazi forces moved towards Russia and were   
nearing Stalingrad. But the Nazi forces could not put up with the   
biting cold of Russia and were limping with handicaps of fever, shivering, and  
other problems of food etc., The Nazi forces thus   
lost the battle of Stalingrad. Soon Russia started their march towards Berlin  
and the Allied forces including Russia invaded Germany and Berlin was  
bombarded. The Allied Forces won the   
second world war. Bhagavan through His universal consciouness,   
could visualize this scenario but did not want to say anything in   
detail.   
3\. Once Kavyakanta said that the town of Tiruvannamalai is like   
a Sri Chakra and soon a town-ship would evolve around this Asramam. This was  
smilingly concurred with by Bhagavan too.   
In another 15 years, Ramana Nagar developed. The Westerners   
built cottages on either side of the Asramam.   
The Universal Consciousness is Pure Consciousness, where the   
Pure Mind pervades the whole universe. Our consciousness which   
is impure, ego-covered, cannot visualize such things concerning the   
whole universe.   
Arunachala Siva.

well said udai garu.   
There is no difference between universal consciousness and normal  
consciousness.   
Subramanian garu,   
You said vivekananda has pure consciousness.Can you please let us know if he  
had pure consciousness always?   
Once bhagavan ramana when asked about swami vivekananda he said as below   
Quote  
30th September, 1936   
 **Talk 252.**   
D.: Sri Ramakrishna touched Vivekananda and the latter realised Bliss. Is it  
possible?   
M.: Sri Ramakrishna did not touch all for that purpose. He did not create  
Atma. He did not create Realisation. **Vivekananda was ripe.He was anxious to  
realise. He must have completed the preliminary course in his past births.  
Such is possible for ripe persons only.**   
D.: Can the same miracle be worked for all?   
M.: If they are fit. Fitness is the point. A strong man controls the weaker  
man. **A strong mind controls the weaker mind. That was what happened in the  
case cited. The effect was only temporary. Why did Vivekananda not sit quiet?  
Why did he wander about after such a miracle? Because the effect was only  
temporary.**   
Source: TALKS WITH SRI RAMANA MAHARSHI Book   
Devotee: Bhagavan, it is said that Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa put his palm on  
the head of Swami Vivekananda and that the latter had transcendental  
experience. Could you not do some such thing for me.   
Bhagavan smiled and said: Yes, scriptures speak of such dikshas (initiations)  
and hastha diksha is one of them. **But that too is a limitation. When a  
mighty river runs overflowing its banks, why divert it into a particular  
channel? Let all those who are thirsty drink to their heart 's content and  
capacity.**

2) Talks With Ramana Maharshi Book  
http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/forum/index.php?topic=4872.0   
Even kavyakanta for that matter is not fully realised which means he is not  
always having pure consciousness.   
Quote  
Though a sincere sadhak, Sastri laid his hands on too many pots.   
Politics, Spiritual upliftment of Indians through mantra japas,   
Congress committee work, visiting various holy places, (he had   
visited 55 temples or holy places in India). His Sankalpas were   
many and strong. When Bhagavan Ramana was informed of his   
passing away, and when someone at that time, asked Him, whether   
Sastri had attained liberation, Bhagavan Ramana said: "How can   
it be, he had many sankalpas.

Sri Ramakrishna said: "God has form and He is formless too. Further, He is beyond both form and  
formlessness. No one can limit Him."   
No can can limit the Universal Consciousness.   
If someone thinks that only recluse can get Self-Realisation, a Lahiri  
Mahasaya is born.   
If someone thinks that only devotees of Siva can get God-Realisation, a  
Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is born.   
If someone thinks that only men can get God-Realisation, a Maa Anandamayi is  
born.   
If someone thinks that God cannot be realised through idol worship, a  
Ramakrisha is born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realised through idol worship, a Ramana  
Maharshi is born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realized through rituals, a Buddha is  
born.   
If someone thinks that God can only be realized in India, a Jesus Christ is  
born.   
If someone thinks that only economically sound people can have realization, a  
Nisargadatta Maharaj is born.   
If someone thinks that only grown-ups can get self-realization, a Jnana  
Sambandar is born.   
If someone thinks that only learned people can get self-realization, a Sarada  
Devi is born.   
If someone thinks a learned people can never get Self-realization, a  
Shankaracharya is born.   
If someone thinks that one can get self-realisation only by satsangs of a  
personal guru, A J. Krishnamurthy is born.   
Whenever there appeared to be a limiting opinion about Universal  
Consciousness, it reappears in a form and shows that it is beyond that limit  
also.   
The Universal Consciousness is beyond all forms.   
However for devotees It is amenable to all forms.   
It is the Krishna of Krishna devotees.   
It is the Shiva of Shiva devotees.   
It is the Ramakrishna of Ramakrisha devotees.   
If is the Ramana of Ramana devotees.   
It is the Christ of Christ devotees.   
It is the Buddha of Buddha devotees.   
So Sri Ramakrisha said: "God has form and He is formless too. Further, He is beyond both form and

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent.   
The universal consciousness cuts across all barriers. That is why   
it is universal, limitless, beyond names and forms. But a person   
who has realized this Advaita Siddhi sees in every form and name   
the Consciousness.   
Saint Jnana Deva, who was in and out a Panduranga (Krishna)   
bhakta had this Advaita Siddhi towards the end of his life. He   
stopped going to the temple, sat simply on the banks of Chandrbhaga river and  
whatever devotees gave him, he was   
eating. Once devotees placed a couple of roti (bread) pieces   
and some jaggery on a leaf and left. Soon a dog came and grabbed   
one roti and was running away. The devotees were aghast not   
knowing what to do? Jnana Deva ran behind the dog, caught it   
and said: O Panduranga, you have taken only the roti. How will   
you eat this dry food. Why not you take this jaggery also?   
Bhagavan Ramana once had a monkey which was stoned and beaten   
up. He used to nurse it everyday. Soon it became alright. On   
seeing the wounds healed up, He rejoiced. The same was the case   
with another dog also. Sri Arunachala Pancharatnam Verse 5: Unnaikkandu ellam unnruvai   
Anniyamil anbu seyym annon.....   
He who, with Heart to you surrendered,   
Beholds for ever you alone.   
Sees all things as forms of you   
And loves and serves them as none other   
Than the Self, O Arunachala!   
Triumphs because he is immersed   
In you whose being is pure bliss.   
Thank you, silentgreen.   
Arunachala Siva.

How can mind become Self?   
mind is mithya.   
Self is Truth.   
So one cannot become the other.   
There is really no difference between normal and universal consciousness.  
There is only one: Consciousness.   
like the space in a pot and space outside. .. we have artificially marked it  
as universal consciousness and normal consciousness.   
There is just Consciousness. what is normal consciousness is also the  
universal.

Dear srkudai,   
We begin saying that the world is unreal. It is for the purpose of   
continuing our seeking the Self. Once the Self is realized, the world   
is Real, Brahma Swarupam. Similarly, the mind is mithya, seemingly   
real on seemingly unreal for the purpose of sadhana. Once the   
self realization takes place it becomes the Brahman.   
*   
Bhagavan Ramana has said: The inherent nature of the Self is Bliss. Some kind of knowledge   
has to be admitted, even in the realization of the supreme bliss.   
It may be said to be subtler than the subtlest.   
The word Vijnana [clear knowledge] is used both to denote the realization of  
the Self and knowing the objects. The Self is wisdom. It functions in two  
ways. When associated with ego, the knowledge is objective [vijnana]. When  
divested of the ego, and the universal Self is realized, it is also called  
Vijnana. The word raises a mental concept. Therefore, we say that the Self  
realized sage knows by his mind, but his mind is pure. Again we say that by  
the vibrating mind is impure and the placid mind is pure. The pure mind is  
itself Brahman. Therefore it follows that Brahman is not other than the mind  
of the Sage.   
*   
To a question as to what is meant by Jnana and Vijnana, Bhagavan Ramana has  
answered in that context: These words may mean differently according to the  
context. Jnana = Samanya Jnana or Pure Consciousness. Vijnana = Visesha  
Jnana. Visesha Jnana may be: a) wordly [relative knowledge]; and b]  
Transcendental - Self realization.   
*   
Guru Vachaka Kovai Verse 1106 states: The pure mind of a Jnani, which exists and shines as the witness, is a mirror  
that reflects even the impure thoughts that arise in his presence, in those  
whose minds are completely warped. Thus,   
he mystifies the minds of others in his presence, by giving the impression  
that he is a deluded person.   
*   
Muruganar also accepted this concept of the impure and pure mind,   
and called them as Chittarivu [small knowledge] and Perarivu [grand  
knowledge].   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian garu,   
Bhagavan Ramana says, When the indefinable power of Brahman separates itself  
from Brahman and, in union with the reflection of consciousness (Chidabhasa)  
assumes various forms, it is called the **impure mind**. When it becomes free  
from the reflection of consciousness (abhasa), through discrimination, it is  
called the **pure mind**.   
But there are no answers to questions like   
why does we assume various forms i.e have impure mind??   
how did karma started in the beginning?   
why god created the universe ??   
Where does maya come from and how did it originate?   
But when these kind of questions were asked by some devotees ramana's typical  
answer was to ask to whom these doubts arise? His typical brahmastram :-)

Dear Subramanian,   
That is not like that.   
What is mithya is asat. it cannot become SAT.   
Look at the following statements: The Post is the Ghost.   
The Ghost came from Post.   
The Ghost is unreal.   
Mind is the Ghost. Self is SAT. The Ghost does not "Become" Post. The Ghost is  
not there at all. There was always the post.   
So now, that does not mean, the "Ghost-Like" Appearance vanishes. IT  
continues; but you are not confused that it is Ghost.   
You only see Self.   
This is what Bhagavan said when he said "I have no thoughts". Not that the  
thoughts are not appearing etc. But that they are like the   
Ghost imagined on the pole. They continue to appear. .. but we know there is  
only Consciousness.   
Love!

Where were the thoughts during sushupti?   
Why then the thoughts arise again after waking from sleep?   
As long as there is 'I' thought, so long there will be mind, thoughts.   
When the I is merged, thoughts, Mind, all are naught.   
This is the essence of Dakshinamurthy. the Universal consciousness is Pure  
without a pinch of 'I-ness' \- no mind !!   
It is simple awareness, where there is no 'I' arising,   
That is consciousness.   
When there is I thought popping out, there is mind.   
As long there is mind, there is Jagart Swapna Sushupti.   
Consciousness is beyond these three states, that implies, destruction of mind,  
which itself is I thought.   
Consciousness is (state) where there is no one who can own anymore the thought  
of consciousness. So long there is mind, there is owner to thoughts.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

so is there no consciousness when there are thoughts?   
consciousness IS.   
thoughts or no thougts. how does it matter. Infact that there is a thought  
itself is a proof that there is Consciousness.   
And infact, even now Consciousness is without thoughts. Consciousness is ever  
without thoughts: As even space is without clouds. Clouds float in space; but  
space is without clouds.   
So presence or absence of clouds is not a problem for Space.

Consciousness ever is, no doubt about it,   
its as simple as the difference between Sri Ramana Maharshi and us...   
Curds is found in Milk itself, can we drink milk thinking it as curds? there  
is difference, Milk is milk, curds is curds, though both are in essence one  
and the same.   
When there is curds, it is no more Milk.   
Thats the point

Dear srkudai,   
Yes. I agree Consciousness is both Bhagavan Ramana and we. But   
our consciousness, is more often than not, mind-consciousness,   
ego-consciousness and world consciousness. Bhagavan Ramana is   
ever, eternally unchanging Pure Consciousness. It is pure because   
it is without mind/ego and the world. Even we taste this Pure   
Consciousness, with our mind curling up with the Self in deep sleep.   
If we are denied, even these few hours of sleep everyday, we shall all go mad,  
because the mind and the world is too much with us.   
Murugnar covers these aspects in his Guru Vachaka Kovai verses: Verse 967: Iswara, the Atma Swarupam, while remaining beyond   
mind-consciousness and shining free from attributes and limitations, assumes  
thee two [attributes and limitations] through pure maya, and then appears in  
the very visible form of the physical Guru in order to bestow His grace on  
devotees. His grace is only   
the Being-Consciousness that shines unbroken as 'I-I' in the stillness [that  
is experienced ] when the ego subsides in the Heart,   
its Source, by enquiry, with its attention turned towards the Self.   
Verse 985: In truth, only the Self, Pure Consciousness, causes the  
appearances of all imaginary differences by appearing as the illusory limited  
consciousness. Therefore, true Jnanis who have known and attained through  
enquiry the Self that shines equally   
in everything, all those other things are wholly Self [tanmaya].   
Verse 1009: The eternal state, the refuge where one rests free   
from the weariness of wandering hither and thither in distress, is the  
wondrous turiya firmament, Sivam, the Self Supreme, which flouishes as the  
undivided being consciousness and is revealed by   
the Jnana Guru.   
Verse 1010: If you abide unshakeably in the Self, that state will destroy the  
bond created by sankalpas, like a snake shuffling of its slough. When you  
persevere, abiding in such nishta [Self abidance] to the very end, that which  
manifests is the absolutely empty firmament of Pure Consciousness.   
Verse 1036: Since the dualistic differences do not, in truth, exist, the Self  
is only the being that is perfectly Pure Consciounsess which is entirely free  
from any trace of knowledge and ignorance. In that Self, the Brahma Swarupam  
that is intense Prajnana, know that there is not even a trace of ignorance.   
Verse 1037: If the Self does not exist as being-consciousness, how can the  
diverse vijnana differences [knowledge of specific things] arise in it?  
Therefore that Brahman, the Self is not only free from ignorance, but is  
itself the Swarupam, the Transcendental Consciousness.   
Verse 1046: It exists as the extremely subtle light of being consciousness;  
it is without the rising of the ego that objectively   
knows 'alien' objects as 'this'. Trying to know it, the intellect, the jiva  
bodha, grows exhausted and laments, 'I have not known it'.   
It is concentrated mauna. Such is the Self, being consciousness.   
Verse 1058: Because of the excellence of the Swarupam, the oneness in which  
the seer himself becomes the seeing, one's   
real nature is the most exalted. The 'I' nature, the mauna-light   
in which the ego, the seer 'I' has completely died, is the Self,   
Consciousness the Supreme.   
Verse 1059: The Swarupam that is the abode of the bliss of consciousness is  
the vast ocean and deep ocean of intense   
peace. Those who dive deep within by merging their minds in the Heart, will  
attain the eternal and inexhaustible treasure of he grace of the Self.   
Verse 1064: You should know that 'I' the form of consciousness, by enquiring  
'Who am I?' with calm deliberation, and then get absorbed in your Swarupam,  
consciousness. What purpose is served instead by separating yourself from  
that consciousness, deluding yourself by taking yourself to be the chidabhasa,  
the mind-form dwelling in the ruinous sense objects and suffering?   
Verse 1115: The Jnani knows the entire world that appears in consciousness as  
Pure Consciousness alone. Realizing that the world has no independent reality  
apart from Consciousness, he will abide calmly in the Self. He is the wealthy  
and fortunate one.   
Verse 1117: The Swarupam alone exists in the Swarupam, the nondual fullness  
that is Pure Consciousnes and supreme grace.   
Within it the differences of the 'I' [the seer] and 'this' [the seen]   
do not exist. Therefore, those whose minds have dived deep in that fullness  
will not suffer and lament in the false life of duality that is an imaginary  
appearance.   
Verse 1222: That which shines as the residue is the peace that is wholly  
consciousness. That indeed is the eternal Sivam. That residue, the  
consummate supreme, is aham _, the ego-free mauna that is the culmination of  
liberation.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 You have put it nicely. There being only consciousness. .. we see its reflection in the mind. .. the reflection is seen as changing due to ripples and we think consciousness is changing. its purely the reflection that is changing.   
Consciousness is every Self.   
there is really no mind-consciousness. the mind functions in the presence of  
consciousness and we seem to somehow associate mind forms with consciousness  
... this we should stop.   
its like my mind is calm and i feel i am calm.   
my mind is full of thoughts, i think i have thoughts.   
just a point that needs consideration: if mind is full of agitations, how can  
we say i am agitated, since i am consciousness and not the mind!!

Dear everyone,   
The discussions came for the purpose of knowing and understanding   
the Universal Consciousness. I shall illustrate Universal Consciousness with  
three examples.   
1\. Swami Vivekananda [after his return from America] was staying   
in Belur Math. During a night, he had no proper sleep. He was turning from  
side to side during the night, and this was noticed by some devotees, who were  
lying in the adjacent room. In the morning, they asked Swami for the reasons  
for restless sleep. Swami Vivekananda then explained: "I think there is  
something seriously wrong somewhere in the world. I could sense people crying  
and running!" The morning newspapers carried a headline story where it was  
reported that there was an earthquake in South America and thousands had been  
killed and some more thousands had been injured. The book of SRK Math has  
described the story and also called it as Universal Consciousness. Not  
everyone gets such a sense of a danger happening elsewhere in the world. This  
is   
Pure Consciousness which pervades the whole universe.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana was sitting in the Hall. Devotees were   
vociferously discussing the war news. Nazi forces had captured   
Paris in 4 days and were relentlessly bombing London. [Eagles   
Over London]. The defeat of Allied Forces was expected to happen soon. At  
that time, Russia [later Soviet Union] had not participated   
in the war as yet. Bhagavan Ramana said: 'Eh, but Russia....' He   
did not continue the sentence. Within 6 months, Russia had joined the war,  
and an angry Nazi forces moved towards Russia and were   
nearing Stalingrad. But the Nazi forces could not put up with the   
biting cold of Russia and were limping with handicaps of fever, shivering, and  
other problems of food etc., The Nazi forces thus   
lost the battle of Stalingrad. Soon Russia started their march towards Berlin  
and the Allied forces including Russia invaded Germany and Berlin was  
bombarded. The Allied Forces won the   
second world war. Bhagavan through His universal consciouness,   
could visualize this scenario but did not want to say anything in   
detail.   
3\. Once Kavyakanta said that the town of Tiruvannamalai is like   
a Sri Chakra and soon a town-ship would evolve around this Asramam. This was  
smilingly concurred with by Bhagavan too.   
In another 15 years, Ramana Nagar developed. The Westerners   
built cottages on either side of the Asramam.   
The Universal Consciousness is Pure Consciousness, where the   
Pure Mind pervades the whole universe. Our consciousness which   
is impure, ego-covered, cannot visualize such things concerning the   
whole universe.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 these are powers. they belong to the mind. coz they pertain to the mithya world.   
There is absolutely no difference between universal consciousness and normal  
consciousness.   
Love!

well said udai garu.   
There is no difference between universal consciousness and normal  
consciousness.   
Subramanian garu,   
You said vivekananda has pure consciousness.Can you please let us know if he  
had pure consciousness always?   
Once bhagavan ramana when asked about swami vivekananda he said as below   
Quote  
30th September, 1936   
 **Talk 252.**   
D.: Sri Ramakrishna touched Vivekananda and the latter realised Bliss. Is it  
possible?   
M.: Sri Ramakrishna did not touch all for that purpose. He did not create  
Atma. He did not create Realisation. **Vivekananda was ripe.He was anxious to  
realise. He must have completed the preliminary course in his past births.  
Such is possible for ripe persons only.**   
D.: Can the same miracle be worked for all?   
M.: If they are fit. Fitness is the point. A strong man controls the weaker  
man. **A strong mind controls the weaker mind. That was what happened in the  
case cited. The effect was only temporary. Why did Vivekananda not sit quiet?  
Why did he wander about after such a miracle? Because the effect was only  
temporary.**   
Source: TALKS WITH SRI RAMANA MAHARSHI Book   
Devotee: Bhagavan, it is said that Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa put his palm on  
the head of Swami Vivekananda and that the latter had transcendental  
experience. Could you not do some such thing for me.   
Bhagavan smiled and said: Yes, scriptures speak of such dikshas (initiations)  
and hastha diksha is one of them. **But that too is a limitation. When a  
mighty river runs overflowing its banks, why divert it into a particular  
channel? Let all those who are thirsty drink to their heart 's content and  
capacity.**

Even kavyakanta for that matter is not fully realised which means he is not  
always having pure consciousness.   
Quote  
Though a sincere sadhak, Sastri laid his hands on too many pots.   
Politics, Spiritual upliftment of Indians through mantra japas,   
Congress committee work, visiting various holy places, (he had   
visited 55 temples or holy places in India). His Sankalpas were   
many and strong. When Bhagavan Ramana was informed of his   
passing away, and when someone at that time, asked Him, whether   
Sastri had attained liberation, Bhagavan Ramana said: "How can   
it be, he had many sankalpas.

Dear prasanth,   
I brought Swami Vivekananda and Kavyakanta Ganapati Sastri   
only to show their universal consciousness. I am not sure whether   
he had it permanently or temporarily. But Kavyakanta, as Bhagavan   
Ramana said in Verse 80 of AAMM, had the glimpse of transcendence,   
of pure nirvikalpa samadhi. He had this glimpses on many occasions   
in Tiruvannamalai.   
Arunachala Siva.

For Bhagavan everything was happening on itself like a cloud in the sky. It is  
the truth. Because He understood the truth and He was (is now also) witnessing  
whereas due to ignorance we think I am eating, sleeping, walking and I am  
suffering. We are not witnessing the happenings. Is it? This is my  
understanding.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. Bhagavan Ramana was "experiencing" the future as if it is   
"present", because He ever lives in the 'present'. Actually, it is   
not 'visualizing' that is "seeing something happening in future".   
He never saw anything, because He is the Eye of the eye.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Who am I?: "To keep the mind ever   
abiding in Atma is true Jnana Dhrishti. Knowing what is happening in a far  
off place, or knowing someone else's mind, or knowing the past, present and  
future are not Jnana Dhrishti.   
Arunachala Siva.
