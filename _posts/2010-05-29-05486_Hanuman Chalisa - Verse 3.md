**Verse 3**   
 _Jai Hanuman gyan gun sagar   
Jai Kapis tihun lok ujagar_   
 **Meaning** :  **Victory to thee, O 'Hanuman! Ocean of Wisdom-All hail to you O'Kapisa!  
(fountain-head of power,wisdom and Shiva-Shakti) You illuminate all the three  
worlds (Entire cosmos) with your glory.**   
 **Commentary** : Here god is glorified which reminds us that bhakthi bhava towards god is very  
important.It is only by the power of the god that all the three worlds are  
illuminated.   
Here three worlds that are referred are devaloka (world of the celestials),  
manusyaloka(this world of ours), and naraka (hell).   
The first has nothing but pleasure; in the second it is a mixture of happiness  
and sorrow; and in the third there is nothing but pain and sorrow. According  
to our sastras a man who has committed terrible sins goes through torments of  
hell before taking lowly birth again in this world.   
It is only here that we have some freedom and we may earn merit or demerit by  
our actions. We may use our hands to perform puja - or we may use them to hurt  
others. We may sing the praises of Isvara - or we may speak ill of people. We  
have the power to do good and evil in this world. For each of our faculties of  
action ( karmendriya ) God has given us this twin capacity.   
Other worlds are like hotels where the denizens eat what we harvest here.  
There you may enjoy the fruits you have merited here by your actions in  
proportion to the punya you have earned or the papa you have piled up.   
In Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam's 50 divine thoughts it says   
Bhakti alone can give us the capacity to put up with sorrows. Temples are the  
agencies for developing that Bhakti. Hence, the need for temples at all  
places. All offerings to the deities in the temples are tokens of our  
gratitude to God.   
As known Sri RamaKrishna Paramahamsa has shown outstanding bhakthi bhava  
towards Divine Mother Kali.   
 **Bhagavan Sri Ramana has made it quite clear that people who have had no  
literary education could also attain the highest knowledge through both the  
ways enumerated above,but people of an emotional nature will benefit  
themselves more by bhakti and people of a reflective mood will have better  
appeal to jnana.**   
He says,The path of devotion is the easiest of all. Meditate on God or on some  
mental or material image of Him. This will slow down your mind and it will get  
controlled of its own accord."   
In "Ellam Ondre" Chapter III Verse 9 says,   
Practice with faith in the period of ignorance is called Bhakti; the same,  
with knowledge, is called Jnana. Of the two divisions of Bhakti, the one is  
devotion to God with name and form, and the other is karma which is love for  
all. Of the two divisions of Jnana, the practice of the true way shown by the  
Master is called yoga and the resulting state is called Jnana. It is natural  
for all to believe in something which is not seen and then to find it. Those  
who do not believe can never find. Therefore, the believers will gain  
something sometime or other and the unbelievers never gain anything. You can  
believe even for the simple reason that faith in God is not harmful. Thereby  
you can share the good effects. **This world is meant only for creating faith  
in you. This is the purpose of creation. Have faith and you can reach God.**

I met some people who say we must have faith on us instead of other things.  
They do not agree to have faith on God. I think it is always better to have  
faith on God, through Him we will have faith on us firmly and slowly this  
faith which leads us to understand that we and God are one. This is the safe  
path.
