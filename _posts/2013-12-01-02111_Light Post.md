## Eka Jiva and what is this concept all about?

Below is the Q & A that happened on David Godman forum. June 2, 2010 at 10:34  
PM   
The question is simple and answer has ten points. But I want the learned  
members to give some background on the ten scriptures pointed out here.   
 **The Question**   
david do you know about any texts which propound the eka jiva doctrine in  
detail?kindly list the same if you can.   
**David Godman Replies**   
I consulted a friend who is an expert on this and he sent me the following  
reply: Well, the Whoâs Who of recent scholars (i.e. 1920âs and later) from  
Hiriyanna, Suryanarayana Shastri, V. Iyer (Swami Siddheswaranandaâs mentor)  
onwards to Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, Warrier etc have certainly rubbished eka-jiva  
as solipsistic nonsense. Even T.M.P. Mahadevan seems to belong to this camp,  
though in his writings, perhaps due to Sri Bhagavanâs influence, he only  
expresses skepticism towards, rather than outright rejection of eka-jiva. In  
fact, the later Acharyas openly propounding eka-jiva have been somewhat  
derisively dubbed as âneo-Advaitinsâ by this lot (now of course, the term  
has moved-on to new connotations). Personally, I have found it shocking that  
such learned men could close their minds so easily to a teaching obviously at  
the very core of Advaita. But to be fair to them, eka-jiva, undoubtedly, is  
the most difficult of concepts to really understand without considerable  
spiritual advancement as an accompaniment.   
I believe some confusion may also have arisen because the technical term  
âeka-jivaâ itself seems to have been formalized only in the 15th â 16th  
Century, thoâ the ideas it represents form the core of Advaita right from  
the beginning. And there is confusion also because doctrinal Advaita supports  
both eka-jiva & aneka-jiva at different levels; the former being the  
âhigherâ view, with aneka-jiva or multiple jivas being acceptable at the  
empirical level. And then there is some muddying of waters because of the term  
âeka-atmaâ, as used in the Mandukya.   
But the indisputable, and largely unknown, fact is that virtually all the  
Great Acharyas of Advaita, ancient & medieval, staunchly support eka-jiva. I  
believe that the Upanisads (esp. Mandukya + Karika), the Brahma Sutras & Sri  
Sankara himself propound eka-jiva if studied properly. Sri Sarvajnatman in his  
great work Samsksepa-Sariraka, itself a seminal work of Advaita, says so in so  
many words. [And we know that the Yoga-Vasista propounds dristi-sristi  
(therefore implying eka-jiva) in many verses].   
Here is a representative list of post-Sankara writers who propound eka-jiva  
(and dristi-sristi): 1\. Samsksepa-Sariraka by Sri Sarvajnatman, disciple of Sri Suresvara, and  
said to have been initiated by Sri Sankara himself, and thus from Sri  
Sankaraâs times. But scholars place him much later at around 1000 CE because  
he has commented on a particular doctrine said to be authored by Sri  
Vimuktatman below.   
2\. Ista-Siddhi by Sri Vimuktataman, (1000 CE by scholars).   
3\. Advaita-Siddhi by Sri Madhusudana Saraswati (1500âs CE). Sri Madhusudana  
Saraswati was an acknowledged genius the likes of whom have been rare even  
amongst the Great Acharyas. He proves that dristi-sristi necessarily has to  
imply eka-jiva also, and the 2 cannot be separated.   
4\. Siddhanta-Bindu by Sri Madhusudan Saraswati   
5\. Vedanta-Siddhanta-Muktavali by Sri Prakasananda (1500âs CE)   
6\. Vedanta-Tattva-Viveka by Sri Narasimhasrama (1500âs CE)   
7\. Siddhantalesasangraha by Sri Appaya Diksitar (late 1500âs CE)   
Also   
8\. Pancapadika with Vivarana by Sri Prakakastman, again said to be a disciple  
of Sri Sankara, but scholars place him at around 1000 CE.   
9\. Khandanakhandakhadya by Sriharsa (1100âs CE)   
10\. Citsukhi by Sri Citsukha (1200âs CE)   
Can personally vouch that the first 6 propound eka-jiva & dristi-sristi; the  
7th is sort of an encyclopedia of all the extant Advaita ideas. The last 3  
also apparently support eka-jiva, but I havenât studied them yet and thus  
cannot confirm the same from personal knowledge.

Dear Krishnan,   
Eka Jiva means that there is only Atma. There is no Paramatma and Jivatma  
business here. The life in Jiva is only a reflection   
of Ekatma, as the sunlight falling in each water filled pot. Each pot shows  
the surya bhimba and the real Sun which is one   
is elsewhere. See Sri Bhagavan's Ekatma Panchakam. A Brahma Jnani sees all  
the living beings as one Jiva (Eka Jiva) shining   
within the Ekatama (the only Atma)   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Krishna, eka-jiva vada and drishti-srishti vada are the Indian equivalent  
of the Western solipsism. It suggests that even in the phenomenal level there  
is only one jiva which imagines that there are other jivas, world and God. I  
can only say that I don't agree that all Advaita Sages are proponent of eka-  
jiva vada. This is just David Godman's presumption. If I (the jiva) imagine  
Ishvara (meaning that He is just imagination in my mind) then I am ruling my  
and other jivas karma which is absurd. Sri Shankara would never accept such  
theory. Bhagavan has accepted eka-jiva vada for advanced sadhakas as good  
working theory, to make them more dispassionate towards goal but He clearly  
declared that drishti-srishti vada is also wrong and He taught only ajata-vada  
(nothing is created). But we can generally say that Bhagavan is proponent of  
eka-jiva vada. This is what He has said in Guru Vachaka Kovai: Quote  
> Let highly mature and courageous aspirants who have a bright and sharp  
> intellect, firmly accept that soul [jiva] is only one [eka] and thereby be  
> established deep in the heart [by enquiring 'Who am I, that one jiva?']. It  
> is only to suit immature minds that scriptures generally say that souls  
> [jivas] are many [nana].  
I can only disagree that Sri Shankara has taught eka-jiva vada. This is just  
not true in my view. What Subramanian has said is ekatma-jiva vada which is  
different theory from eka-jiva vada. Eka-jiva vada is total denial of  
everything outside jiva's mind. It says that there are not other minds or  
souls and everything is creation of the jiva's mind.

Dear Hari,   
Only Ekatma Bhavam can bring about Eka Jiva experience. See Sri Arunachala  
Pancharatnam, Verse 5 of Sri Bhagavan.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian, I was talking about the general understanding of eka-jiva  
vada, not just Bhagavan's view. And eka-jiva vada is definitely = drishti-  
srishti vada = western solipsism.

And all this city's breathtaking domes.   
I am the music in all those choirs   
I am the strand of bliss in all lifes.   
I am the lies in all those sinners   
I am the agony of all those deaths.   
I am the magician of million illusions   
I am the essence of all things real   
I am the trickster with a bag of tricks   
I am the author of all the learned tomes.   
I am the creator of all the galaxies   
I am the director who makes them work flawlessly.   
I am all the army of the Goddess   
I am all the reason behind rationality.   
I am the creator of the illusion that's me.   
I am the traveller in the path of wisdom   
I am the flame of unifying knowledge   
in all things ever created.

silentgreen/Nagaraj/Friends,   
 _The touch of Earth is always reinvigorating to the son of Earth, even when  
he seeks a supraphysical Knowledge. It may even be said that the supraphysical  
can only be really mastered in its fullnessâto its heights we can always  
reachâwhen we keep our feet firmly on the physical. âEarth is His  
footing,â (pAdOsya viswA bhootAni-Ravi)says the Upanishad whenever it images  
the Self that manifests in the universe. And it is certainly the fact that the  
wider we extend and the surer we make our knowledge of the physical world, the  
wider and surer becomes our foundation for the higher knowledge, even for the  
highest, even for the Brahmavidya._

To all the above wonderful posts, I add this of Tagore titled "Aanandadhara  
Bahiche Bhubane": Streams of Bliss are flowing across the Universe,   
Day and Night so many Nectar-like essence (of that Bliss) are overflowing the  
endless Sky,   
The Sun and the Moon drink handfuls of that (and Shine),   
And its undecaying Illumination remains always Luminous. ..   
... and fills the Earth with eternal Life and Light,   
(O Friend) Why are you sitting enclosed within your own thoughts?   
Why are you immersed within your little self?   
Look around expanding your heart,. ..   
... considering the little sorrows as trivial,. ..   
... and Fill your empty Life with that Bliss of Love, O Friend, fill your  
empty Life with that Bliss of Love.
