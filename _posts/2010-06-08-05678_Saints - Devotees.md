## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Hanuman Chalisa - Verse 12 And 13  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 11, 2010, 04:53:46 AM

**Verse 12**   
Bhima roop dhari asur sanghare   
Ramachandra ke kaj sanvare   
**Verse 12 Meaning**   
With over-whelming might you destroyed the Asuras (demons) and performed all  
tasks assigned to you by Shri Ram with great skill.   
 **Verse 13**   
Laye Sanjivan Lakhan Jiyaye   
Shri Raghuvir Harashi ur laye   
**Verse 13 Meaning**   
 **You brought Sanjivan (A herb that revives life) and restored Lakshman back  
to life, Shri Raghuvir (Shri Ram) cheerfully embraced you with his heart full  
of joy.**   
 **Commentary :**   
In Verse 12 tulasidas tells that lord hanuman performs with great skill/zest  
all tasks assigned by Lord Shri Rama.   
God-Guru's grace is much required if we are to progress in this spiritual life  
and to eradicate ignorance in us.   
As known with ramakrishna paramahamsa's grace narendra has become swami  
vivekananda and has revived hinduism and can easily say that he is one of the  
most influential hindu saints in 20th century.   
When he asked his master ramakrishna whether he as seen god,master said in  
return "Is there anyone who has not seen god?" which impressed vivekananda and  
be became a great disciple of bhagavan ramakrishna.   
As guru ramana says,   
As a lion seen in a dream by an elephant, awakens him; so the Guru, who is a  
sage, awakens the disciple from the dream of ignorance.The cause of all  
miseries is the impure vasana, the belief that holds the body to be I.   
The grace of the Guru is like an ocean. If you come with a cup, you will only  
receive a cupful.It is no use complaining of the niggardliness of the ocean;  
the bigger the vessel, the more you will be able to carry.It is entirely upto  
you.   
In Verse 13 tulasidas describes that Lord Hanuman has brought Sanjivan (A herb  
that revives life) and restored Lakshman back to life which made Lord Rama  
happy.   
Miracles do happen with guru's grace and we have seen many incidents in past  
regarding miracles.   
In Mahabharata war lord krishna saved arjuna and other pandavas manytimes with  
his miracles else pandavas would have lost the war.

## Hanuman Chalisa - Verse 10 And 11  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: June 08, 2010, 01:33:31 PM  
---  
Verse 10   
Prabu charitra sunibe ko rasiya   
Ram Lakhan Sita man Basiya   
 **Verse 10 Meaning**   
 _You are an ardent listener, always so keen to listen to the narration of  
Shri Ram 's Life Stories. Your heart is filled with what Shri Ram stood for.  
You therefore always dwell in the hearts of Shri Ram, Lakshman and Sita._   
 **Verse 11**   
Sukshma roop dhari Siyahi dikhava   
Vikat roop dhari lanka jarava   
 **Verse 11 Meaning**   
 _You appeared before Sita in a Diminutive form and spoke to her in humility.  
You assumed an awesome form and struck terror by setting Lanka on fire._   
 **Commentary** : In Verse 10 Tulasidas reminds that Lord Hanuman always listens with love and  
devotion to narrations of Shri Ram's Life Stories.   
Similarly Guru Ramana Maharshi was inspired by Periya Puranam which describes  
the legendary lives of the sixty-three Nayanars, the canonical poets of Tamil  
Shaivism.   
Ramana Maharshi before his self-realisation in Madurai read only Periya  
Puranam and few parts of Bible.   
So it is always adviced to devotees to read and discuss your favourite god's  
life history and his teachings.   
Ramana Maharshi's devotees Mastan Swami and Desur Akhilandamma would make a  
bundle of provisions, such as rice and pulses, and put them on his head.  
Loaded in this way, they would start on our journey of forty miles to  
Arunachala from desur. They would walk slowly and leisurely, telling each  
other stories of Bhagavan.   
So we need to take inspiration from Mastan Swami and Desur Akhilandamma in  
this regard.   
So here total surrender to guru/god is suggested.   
In Verse 11 Tulasidas reminds that Lord Hanuman was in a state of humility  
when spoke to goddess Sita Devi but when required and when his guru/god is in  
danger then lord hanuman would not hesitate to assume awesome form and destroy  
the evil and save the guru/god.   
Ramana Maharshi Devotee Perumalswami though very strong was very humble in the  
presence of guru ramana maharshi but when required and if he sees any trouble  
for his guru he used to fierce back so strongly on the wicked people.   
 **Below is one incident in which Perumalswami protects his guru**   
In 1916, an attempt was made by some drunken pandarams (sadhus) to take away  
the Sri Bhagavan from Tiruvannamalai. They came to Virupaksha Cave and  
solemnly informed the Swami, âWe are sadhus from Podigai Hill, the sacred  
Hill in which the ancient Agastya Rishi is still doing his tapas,as he has  
done for thousands of years. He has ordered us to take you first to the  
Siddhasâ conference at Srirangam and thence to Podigai, to give you regular  
diksha, (initiation) after extracting those salts from your body which prevent  
the attainment of higher powers.â   
The situation was evidently serious. The Swami,with his rule of equanimity  
maintained silence and awaited developments. Meanwhile, a strong and  
resourceful disciple of his, Perumalswami, hit upon a remedy. Accosting the  
newcomers,Perumalswami said, âWe have received intimation of your visit and  
we have been commissioned to place your bodies in crucibles(melting pot) and  
place the crucibles over the fire. What do you say?â and he also told a  
fellow disciple Mastan, âGo and dig a deep pit for preparing the fire for  
those people.â The visitors were dumbfounded and promptly retreated.   
But unfortuntely later this same guy Perumalswami for selfish reasons had a  
tiff with guru ramana for different reasons.

Yes. As Tulasidas said Lord Hanuman listens with dovotion and love of Sri  
Ram's story, I have seen when Ramayanam is read or doing pravachanam, near the  
photo of Ram, one plank will be placed and covered with red silk cloth. They  
say it is the seat offering to Lord Hanuman to sit and listen the Ramayana.

That is excellent ramanaduli garu. That shows the devotion(bhakti) aspect to  
the highest level.

It is truely said, Hanuman is Balavan (most powerful) Bhudhiman. He knows all  
sastras but He never shows infront of Rama. In tamil He is called sollin  
chelvan. i.e. He knows how to where to what to say the word.   
Once I heard from the pravachanam. I do not know whether this incident is in  
Ramayana or not. But it shows how He is devoted to Ram. After the  
Pattabhishekam, Sita was very much pleased for the service of Hanuman so she  
presented her pearl mala to Hanuman. He received it but He did not put on His  
neck instead He started biting each pearl and was seeing. Sita got angry then  
she asked why He was spoiling her gift. Hanuman told her, He was searching  
whether there is Ram inside it.   
The Pandit told He wanted to see Ram every where, in every particle. Otherwise  
it does not matter for Him how much it is costly. In this way we must see Ram  
in every atom. That bhavam we must have.   
In Ramayana there are so many people who were drawn to Ram. Dasrat, Kowsalya  
even Kaikeyi also. Then there comes all rishis, His public, Guhan, Sabari.  
Vibhishna. But among all these people Hanuman stands first. It is for Bhakti  
only. He is an symbol for bhakti. We must have that type of bhakti. In Kamba  
ramayana we can see His bhakti. Let us pray to grant that type of bhakti to  
attain our Gods or gurus.

Adding to this same thread, in Vishnu temples we can see Hanuman but in some  
shiva temples also we can see   
Hanuman in pillar. People do pujas to this Hanuman. I was told that Shiva took  
Hanuman avatar to serve Narayana.There is no difference in Shiva and Narayana.

Dear grhluna,   
I found that reading the biographies of saints is like doing parayana  
(circumbulation of mountain or some holy place). Normally all biographies are  
available in the internet. However it still helps to put it in one place,  
because internet is such a huge collection of resources. There is no well-  
defined sequence I follow but put them as and when it occurs to me. Swami  
Sivananda is also in my agenda.

## Re:[34]Thiruvalluvar  
Author: silentgreen         Date: April 16, 2010, 10:52:01 AM  
---  
**Thiruvalluvar** : About two thousand years ago there flourished in Mylapore, Madras, a born  
Siddha and a born poet by name Valluvar or, as he is more commonly known,   
**Thiruvalluvar** , which only means, the devotee of the Valluva caste.  
Valluvas are Pariahs (now called Harijans) and their vocation was proclaiming  
the orders of the king by beat of drum. There is a tradition that  
Thiruvalluvar was the son of one Bhagavan, a Brahmin, and Adi, a Pariah woman  
whom he had married.   
Thiruvalluvar was born at Madurai, the capital of the Pandyas. He is regarded  
as an Avatara of Brahma. His wife **Vasuki** was a chaste and devoted lady, an  
ideal wife, who never disobeyed the orders of her husband, but always carried  
them out implicitly. Thiruvalluvar showed people that a person could lead the  
life of a Grihastha or householder, and at the same time, lead a divine life  
or a life of purity and sanctity. He showed people that there was no necessity  
to leave the family and become a Sannyasin to lead a divine life of purity and  
sanctity. All his wise sayings and teachings are now in book form and known as  
 **Thirukkural** . These sayings are all in couplets. Here are some of them:  Just as the alphabet A is the beginning of all letters, so also, God is the beginning for this universe.   
 Learn the Shastras completely and then act according to their injunctions.   
 The Anicha flower will fade by smelling, but guests are more sensitive if the hosts turn their faces a bit.   
 Death is like sleeping in the burial ground;   
 birth is like waking in the morning.   
These couplets are 1,330 in number. They contain the essence of the Vedas, the  
Upanishads and the six Darshanas. Thirukkural is regarded as a universal  
Bible. It is another Gita, Koran or Zend Avesta.   
Some aspirants repaired to Thiruvalluvar and enquired: "O sage, which Ashrama  
of life is betterGrihastha or Sannyasa?". Thiruvalluvar did not give any  
answer. He simply kept quiet. He wanted to teach them the glory of Grihastha  
Ashrama by example.   
Thiruvalluvar was taking cold rice in the morning. He said to his wife: "Vasuki, the rice is very hot. Bring a fan to cool it". Thiruvalluvars wife  
was drawing water from the well when Thiruvalluvar called her. She at once  
left the rope and ran to him with a fan to cool the rice. She did not say to  
her husband: "How can the cold rice be hot? Why do you want a fan now?". She  
simply obeyed his commands. The vessel that contained water was hanging half-  
way in the well unsupported, on account of her Pativrata Dharma Shakti. The  
aspirants noticed this phenomenon and the noble conduct of Vasuki and were  
simply struck with amazement.   
About midday, on another occasion, Valluvar called his wife and said, "Bring a  
lamp immediately, O Vasuki! I am stitching the cloth. I cannot see the eye of  
the needle. I cannot pass the thread properly". Vasuki did not say to her  
husband: "It is broad daylight now. Why do you want a lamp? You can see the  
eye of the needle clearly". But she implicitly obeyed his word. The aspirants  
were much inspired by the ideal life of sage Thiruvalluvar and the exalted  
conduct of Vasuki. They did not speak a word to the saint. They took leave of  
the saint and quietly left the place with profound satisfaction. They were  
deeply impressed by the practical and exemplary life led by Thiruvalluvar and  
Vasuki. They learnt the lesson that the life of an ideal householder was in no  
way inferior to that of an ideal Sannyasin who was treading the path of  
Nivritti and austerity in the Himalayan caves and that each was great in its  
own place, time and circumstances.   
Dear readers! Such ladies sit enthroned in the hearts of their husbands. No  
doubt they are hard to find, because such women never advertise themselves;  
but there must be many in our land of Rishis and sages; and unless we maintain  
such a high level of moral purity, we will all be going down in these days of  
modern civilization and scientific advancement. If the husbands of the present  
day behave like Thiruvalluvar, the wives will say, "My husband has become  
senseless. He wants to fan the rice when it is so cold! He wants a light when  
there is broad sunlight". The wives will rebuke their husbands and fight with  
them.   
That house wherein the wife serves the husband with sincere devotion and  
observes **Pativrata Dharma** is heaven on earth. That house wherein the wife  
fights with the husband and disobeys his orders is a veritable hell on earth.  
Ladies who practise Pativrata Dharma need not go to temples. They need not  
practise any Vrata or penance. Service to the husband becomes worship. They  
can realise God through service to their husbands. Husbands also should be  
ideal persons with noble qualities. Husbands are the Gurus for their wives.  
The wives need not get any initiation from any Acharya. Glory to such exalted  
ladies who practise Pativrata Dharma!   
\-- _Swami Sivananda_

Dear silentgreen,   
Very nice.   
Vasuki's highest chastity is too great to describe.   
Once she was pulling water from a deep well and the bucket   
was half way up to the parapet. Tiruvalluvar called her suddenly   
for some urgent help. She rushed back into the house from the   
back yard. It is said that the bucket half-pulled was simply   
static there at the height left by her without falling down into   
the well.   
Such women, one can see only in some Indian villages or in   
puranas today.

Shri Sivananada is originally from a town called Pathamadai,   
near Tirunelveli, in the deep south of Tamil Nadu. He went   
to Rishikesh and other places and he finally settled down at   
Rishikesh and the Ashram was commenced. Sivananada

Author: silentgreen         Date: April 28, 2010, 12:45:41 PM

**Swami Sivananda (1887 - 1963)**   
 **Swami Sivananda** was born on **8th of September, 1887** in the village of  
**Pattamadai** in South India. His father Sri P.S. Vengu Iyer was a great  
devotee of **Lord Shiva** and mother Srimati Parvati Ammal was a god-fearing  
lady. His boyhood name was **Kuppuswamy**.   
Boy Kuppuswamy was intelligent and mischievous. In his boyhood itself he  
showed signs of Tyaga (renunciation) and love for fellow-beings. He used to  
pity the poor, feed the hungry at the door, and make his father throw a pie  
into the hands of pauper passing by. He often got cakes and sweetmeats from  
his mother and distributed them liberally to his younger companions, dogs,  
cats, crows, and sparrows, himself not eating a bit. He used to bring flowers  
and bael leaves for his father's Siva Puja.   
At the Rajah's High School, Ettayapuram, where he studied, Kuppuswamy always  
topped the class and won prizes every year. He had a sweet voice and wonderful  
memory. After the completion of the First Arts Examination, Kuppuswamy went to  
the Medical School in Tanjore to study medicine. He used to be tremendously  
industrious and never went home during the holidays. He would spend the entire  
period in the hospital. He had free admission into the operation theater.  
Kuppuswamy was first in all subjects. He possessed more knowledge than doctors  
with covetable degrees, and in the first year itself he could answer the  
papers which the final year students could not. Kuppuswamy completed the  
course and earned the title of M.B.,C.M. He practiced at Tiruchi.   
Later he got an offer from Malaya from Mr. Robbins to work in the hospital of  
a rubber estate. The young doctor worked very hard. Dr. Kuppuswamy was very  
kind, sympathetic, humorous, witty, and sweet-speaking. Hopeless cases came to  
him, but success was sure. Everywhere people declared that he had a special  
gift from God for the miraculous cures effected in the patients and acclaimed  
him as a very kind and sympathetic doctor with a charming and majestic  
personality. In serious cases, he kept vigil all night. In his private  
practice, Dr. Kuppuswamy used to attend to the poor and often not charge them  
even visiting or consulting fees. Instead he would give them money for special  
diet or to cover their own expenses after discharge from hospital. He gave  
money like water. Once a poor man, drenched to the skin, came to the doctor at  
night. His wife was in birth pangs. The doctor went there at once to her aid,  
and after attending to her, stayed outside the hut in spite of the heavy rain.  
Only after the save delivery of the child did the doctor return home the next  
morning.   
In spite of his busy life, Dr. Kuppuswamy served the Sadhus, Sannyasins, and  
beggars. He attended marriage functions, parties, and other social gatherings.  
Once a Sadhu gave him a book " **Jiva Brahma Aikyam** " by Sri Swami  
Satchidananda. It ignited the dormant spirituality in him. He began to study  
the books of **Swami Rama Tirtha, Swami Vivekananda, Sankara, Imitation of  
Christ, the Bible, and literature of the Theosophical Society**. He was very  
regular in his daily worship, prayer and Yoga Asanas. Study of sacred  
scriptures like the Gita, the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata, and the Ramayana was  
done with great devotion. Sometimes he conducted Nandan Charitam and sang  
Bhajans and Kirtans. He practiced **Anahat Laya Yoga** and **Swara Sadhana**.   
Nothing could tempt the doctor. His heart was as pure as the Himalayan snow.  
His immense philanthropy and spirit of service and renunciation endeared him  
to all. People lovingly called him the "Heart of Love". As days passed, he  
reflected more and more and wanted to renounce the world. His heart was  
purified through loving service. At last, Dr. Kuppuswamy, enjoying a lucrative  
practice, renounced the world like Prince Siddartha, in 1923. He left Malaya  
for India.   
At Madras he proceeded to the house of a friend and left his luggage there. He  
began his pilgrimage. At **Benares**, he had the Darshan (vision) of Lord  
Visvanath. He visited Mahatmas (great souls) and temples. At Dhalaj, a village  
on the bank of the Chandrabaga river, he met a postmaster and lived with him.  
He acted as the postmaster's cook, and when the latter arrived home in the  
evening, the doctor was ready to shampoo his legs in spite of his  
remonstrances! It was the postmaster who suggested **Rishikesh** when the  
aspiring doctor wanted a place for solitary meditation.   
Dr. Kuppuswamy reached **Rishikesh** on the 8th of May, 1924. On the 1st of  
June, 1924, there came His Holiness **Sri Swami Visvananda Saraswati**. The  
doctor saw a Guru in the monk and the monk saw a Chela (disciple) in the  
doctor. After a brief exchange of words, Dr. Kuppuswamy was initiated into the  
Sannyas order by Swami Visvananda. Swami Vishnudevanandaji Maharaj, the Mahant  
of Sri Kailas Ashram, performed the Viraja Homa ceremonies. The Guru named the  
doctor Swami Sivananda Saraswati. Swami Visvananda wrote the necessary  
instructions about Sannyas Dharma from Benares. Swami Sivanandaji stayed at  
Swargashram for Sadhana.   
Swami Sivananda dressed to clothe himself, ate to live, and lived to serve  
humanity. A small dilapidated Kutir (hut), not resorted to by others and  
infested with scorpions, protected him from rain and sun. Living in that  
Kutir, he did intense Tapas (austerities), observed silence, and fasted. Often  
he fasted for days on end. He would keep a good stock of bread in his room,  
and for a week have this, together with Ganges water. He would stand up to the  
hips in the ice-cold Ganges in winter mornings and commence his Japa, coming  
out only when the sun appeared. He would spend more than twelve hours in daily  
meditation. With all his intense Tapas, Swamiji did not neglect service of the  
sick. He visited the huts of the Sadhus with medicines, served them, and  
shampooed their legs. He begged food on their behalf and fed them with his own  
hands when they fell sick. He brought water from the Ganges and washed their  
Kutirs. He attended upon cholera and small-pox cases. If necessary, he kept  
vigil through the night by the side of the bed of the ailing Sadhu. He carried  
sick persons on his back to the hospital. With some money from his insurance  
policy that had matured, Swamiji started a charitable dispensary at  
Lakshmanjula in 1927. He served the pilgrims and saw Narayana in them. Swamiji  
practiced all the various Yogas and studied the scriptures. After years of  
intense and unbroken Sadhana, he enjoyed the bliss of Nirvikalpa Samadhi. He  
had come to the end of his spiritual journey.   
He used to gather bits of paper and used envelopes, and stitch them into  
little notebooks. He entered some self-instructions in them. Some of the  
instructions found in them read thus: "Give up salt, give up sugar, give up  
spices, give up vegetables, give up chutnies, give up tamarind". In another we  
read: Serve Bhangis, serve rogues, serve inferiors, remove faecal matter,  
clean clothes of Sadhus - take delight, carry water". In another page: "Do not  
revenge, resist not evil, return good for evil, bear insult and injury". On  
some neat little pages we again read: "Forget like a child any injury done by  
somebody immediately. Never keep it in the heart. It kindles hatred. Cultivate  
**Maitri** (friendship), **Karuna** (compassion), **Daya** (mercy), **Prema**  
(love), **Kshama** (forgiveness)". In another paragraph we see: "Develop good  
manners, extreme politeness, courtesy, etiquette, good demeanour, nobility,  
gentleness, mildness. Never be rude, harsh, or cruel. There is nothing to be  
hated in the world. Hatred is ignorance. All contempt for anything or being  
must be removed through love and Vichara (enquiry)".   
Swamiji traveled the whole length and breadth of India during his Parivrajaka  
(wandering monk) life. He visited important places of pilgrimage in the South,  
including **Rameswaram**. He conducted Sankirtan and delivered lectures. He  
visited Aurobindo Ashram and met Maharishi Suddhananda Bharati. At **Ramana  
Ashram**, he had Darshan of **Sri Ramana Maharishi** on the Maharishi's  
birthday. He sang Bhajans and danced in ecstasy with the Bhaktas of Ramana.  
Swamiji went on a trip to **Kailas-Manasarovar** and **Badri**.   
He returned after the pilgrimage, to Rishikesh, and in the year **1936** sowed  
the seed of **The Divine Life Society** on the bank of the holy Ganga. From a  
small beginning the Society grew imperceptibly and it is now the headquarters  
of a world-wide Organization having a large number of Branches both within the  
country and outside. He got the Divine Life Society Registered as a Trust in  
the year 1936, with the main objects of dissemination of spiritual knowledge  
and selfless service of humanity.   
Swami Sivananda's Yoga, which he has significantly called the ' **Yoga of  
Synthesis** ', effects a harmonious development of the 'hand', 'head' and  
'heart' through the practice of Karma Yoga, Jnana Yoga and Bhakti Yoga.   
On the 14th of July **1963**, the Great Soul Swami Sivananda entered  
Mahasamadhi (departure of a Self-realized saint from his mortal coil) in his  
Kutir on the bank of Ganga, in Shivanandanagar.

**Poems on Mother Kali**   
\- _by Ramprasad_   
Who in this world   
can understand what   
Mother Kali really is?   
The six systems of philosophy   
remain powerless to describe Her.   
She is the inmost awareness   
of the sage who realizes   
that Consciousness alone exists.   
She is the life blossoming within   
the creatures of the universe.   
Both macrocosm and microcosm   
are lost within Mother's Womb.   
Now can you sense   
how indescribable She is?   
The yogi meditates upon Her   
in the six subtle nerve centers   
as She sports with delight   
through the lotus wilderness   
of the pristine human body,   
playing with Her Consort,   
Shiva, the Great Swan.   
When anyone attempts to know Her,   
the singer of this song laughs.   
Can you swim across   
a shoreless ocean?   
Yet the child in me still   
reaches out to touch the moon.   
O wavering mind,   
awaken your upward-flowing awareness.   
Become the sublime warrior Goddess Kali,   
who moves with graceful power   
 through the vast landscape of the body.   
Her divine form, like a black storm cloud   
 illumined by the sun,   
she stands unveiled,   
her long hair falling free like monsoon rain.   
Be lost in awe of her, O mind,   
for you will never comprehend her.   
She dwells as the primal lotus of conscious energy   
 and also as the thousand-petal blossom,   
complete enlightenment.   
She is none other than primordial bliss,   
this great swan ever swimming   
 through the lotus jungle of the subtle body.   
Gaze intently into the blazing heart of joy   
 and you will perceive my blissful Mother,   
matrix of all phenomena.   
The vision of Kali   
 kindles the fire of unitive wisdom,   
burning down conventional barriers,   
pervading minds and worlds with light,   
revealing her exalted beauty   
 as universal flower garden   
and universal cremation ground,   
where lovers merge with Mother Reality,   
experiencing the single taste of nonduality.   
This ardent poet of the Goddess cries: "Every lover longs only   
 to gaze upon the unique Beloved.   
Why close your eyes?   
Why disappear into formless trance?"

I think Sri Ramakrishna used to sing Rama Prasad's poems in   
melting devotion.

## Re:[40] Saints / DevoteesThruvalluvar/vasuki

Adding to the greatness of Vasuki there is another story. Once one siddha  
Kokannavar came to Vasuki for food. As she was busy in serving her husband  
Thruvalluvar she came little bit late to this siddha and offered food. He got  
angry for attending late. So he looked as if to burn her. Immedietly vasuki  
told him do you think am i a crane which was burnt by you. The siddha was  
surprised at this comment because he burnt a crane as it put his droppings on  
his body when he was meditating. But it happened far away from vasuki's place.  
When she could know this, she might be very powerful than siddha. He felt  
ashamed for his behaviour and went away to meditate further. Simply vasuki was  
a devoted wife and got enlightened. Thruvalluvar's samadhi is in Mylapore.   
In some books say Thruvalluvar belonged to weaver's community. Thruvalluvar  
gave a treasure to the man kind. i.e. Thrukkural

There are several stories about Tiruvalluvar's birth and community.   
Some say he is a Brahmin and some others say that he belongs   
to Seniyar, weaver's community. Because of his secular nature,   
DMK took him as their favourite poet. In Chennai and other places   
of Tamil Nadu, the transport buses used to have a photograph of   
him, (only a drawing), with a book and the writing instrument on his hands.  
DMK carefully made the portrait in such a way, there is   
a upper cloth across his chest so that there is no upaveedam,   
sacred thread, on his chest!   
He did not write anything about moksham in his Tirukural. He   
had the belief that if dharma, artha and kama are properly   
followed by one, the liberation will come automatically. But there   
are 10 couplets about God in the beginning of Tirukural. There   
he mentions God in a very indirect manner without giving scope to   
guess who is that God. For example, he says God is of 8 characteristics. ( a  
la Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram). He again says   
one should hold god's feet to come out of births and deaths, again   
a Hindu concept. Some used to say that in spite of all these descriptions, he  
was a Jain. Nothing is known clearly. Later   
Tamil poets consider him as a Saivite.   
There are 10 commentaries by 10 different scholars on his   
Tirukural. All of them belong to roughly between 4th century   
and 11th century. There are umpteen modern commentaries too.   
The commentary of Parimelazhagar is considered the best.   
Arunachala Siva.
