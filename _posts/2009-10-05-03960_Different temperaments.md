**Different temperaments**   
One day a master sat in front of his students on a weighing scale and started  
doing japa and meditation. After sometime he became absorbed in joyous ecstasy  
and started saying I feel lighter, lighter  along with some mantras. This  
continued for sometime after which the master came down to the normal plane.   
He asked one of his students: What did you like most?   
The student replied: When you were saying lighter, lighter . .. I was  
looking at the balance to see whether your weight was really changing.   
The master said, Good observation. You better be a scientist.   
He asked the second student: What did you like most?   
The student replied: I was noting down all the mantras you were uttering. I  
want to get the same joyous absorption like you. So I want to try them out.   
The master said, Good observation. You better pursue sadhana.

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent. There is one sentence, I think it was used by J.D.   
Salinger in one of his novels: The unbearable lightness of Being!   
The Being is the lightest and it is the heaviest also. Siddhas,   
Yogis with supra-normal powers, are said to have 8 such powers.   
One is feeling the lightest and the other is feeling the heaviest.   
But a person in pursuit of Jnana, should not be attracted by any   
of these powers which are also Maya's games. He must   
only seek the Being.   
Bhagavan Ramana says that all these Siddhis are also dreams.   
They do not give you any benefit. Nor do they last long.   
You also made a beautiful point on the perceptions of different   
disciples. One is scientific and the other is seeing within, spiritual.  
Science and Spirituality cannot go together.   
Once a speaker was giving a discourse on Srimad Bhagavatam.   
He was telling that Krishna in all, had 8 wives. One listener   
stood up and asked "What are there names?" Are the names   
important? What is the purport behind this figure 8? They   
are 8 powers, supra-normal powers. That is all the symbolism. One who wants  
the names of 8 wives of Krishna is interested   
only in details. All details are only for science. An inward-looking person  
in pursuit of the Self would never bother about details.   
Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram of Sri Sankara also covers this powers, in one of  
its stanzas.   
Arunachala Siva.
