Seshadri Swamigal ("Saint with a golden hand")   
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seshadri_Swamigal   
Sri Seshadri Swamigal, well known as the **" Saint with a golden hand", is one  
of the greatest Indian saints who lived Thiruvannaamalai.  
He is worshipped as a religious guru by many Hindus throughout the world.   
Sri Seshadri Swamigal was born on January 22, 1870 in a small village near  
**Kanchipuram** in South India in the renowned family of Kamakoti. He studied  
Vedas (Hindu religious literature) at a very young age. _An incident in his  
childhood reveals the greatness of his power when his mother took him to a  
temple fair and he touched an idol from a seller who had all the idols sold  
out like hotcakes, which were not getting sold out earlier.   
This gave him the name "Thanga Kai" (golden hand)._ His parents died when he  
was still in his teens. Just before his mother died, she asked him to sing  
'Ambe Sive' (a composition of his grandfather's) and then, in the moments  
before she died, she called out, "Arunachala! Arunachala! Arunachala!" The  
word Arunachala struck a deep cord in Sheshadri Swamigal. Though he had never  
been to Arunachala, he sketched the five peaks of the holy hill on a board and  
from then on worshipped Arunachala every day.   
Having no worldly attachments, he became a sanyasi (ascetic) and came to  
Tiruvannamalai in 1889 at age nineteen and remained there for forty years  
until he died in the year 1929.   
When Ramana Maharshi came to Tiruvannamalai seven years after Seshadri  
Swamigal's arrival, Seshadri was immediately aware of the young swami's state  
of Self-abidance and he felt a motherly love for him. Sri Ramana spent his  
time then immersed in the bliss of the Self in the thousand-pillared hall in  
the front portion of the Arunachaleswara Temple. Urchins, not understanding  
his state, pelted him with stones. Sri Seshadri tried to protect the young  
swami who seemed quite unaware of his body and surroundings, but the urchins  
continued their harassment. To avoid this unwanted attention, Sri Ramana moved  
into the Patalalingam, an underground vault in the temple. He remained there,  
in deep meditation, for many day, oblivious to the ants, vermin, and  
mosquitoes who were feasting on him. Sri Seshadri found him there and asked  
his (Sri Seshadri's) devotee Venkatachala Mudaliar to lift "his child" out.  
**He cleansed Ramana 's blood-oozing wounds and revealed Ramana as a [saint]  
to the world.**   
Seshadri Swamigal's behavior was quite eccentric and unpredictable. He acted  
like a mad man at times to fend off worldly people, but to earnest seekers he  
was extremely gentle and considerate.   
Sri Seshadri blessed his devotees and helped cure their illnesses with his  
wonderful touch. While roaming the streets of Tiruvannamalai, he would  
sometimes enter a shop and dump the cash from a cashbox or throw the articles  
from the shops. The shops he entered used to do good business on that day and  
so shop keepers would eagerly await his arrival. To this day, the shops in  
Tiruvannamalai have his photos as a symbol of good luck and prosperity.   
Sri Seshadri was a great worshipper of Shakti.   
Sri Seshadri died in January 1929, at the age of 59. His body was not cremated  
but buried, as is the custom in the case of a saint. It is believed that  
Bhagavan Ramana Maharishi was present at the place silently observing the  
rituals till it was completed.   
**It is often quoted that the devotees called Sri Seshadri "Periya Seshadri"  
(elder Seshadri) and Sri Ramana Maharishi as "Chinna Seshadri" (younger  
Seshadri).**

Seshadri Swamigal was a upasaka of Mother. He deliberately roamed   
like a mad man, since he did not want people to crowd around him.   
He used to abuse, even bodily hurt some people. If true devotees   
come near him, he used to behave like a child. Akhilandamma who   
was a Bhagavan Ramana's devotee, also revered Seshadri Swamigal   
and had even given him a bath and food, many times. Seshadri   
Swamigal truly understood the self realized state of Bhagavan   
Ramana and both have met each other on a few occasions. Seshadri Swamigal  
himself has wondered at Bhagavan Ramana's thoughtless   
state, and has said: I am getting a salary of Rs 1000/-. My younger brother  
is getting a salary of Rs 10,000/-. Should you not get   
at least a salary of Rs 100/- [meaning that devotees should do   
good karmas and at least earn some merit, if not liberation.]   
Seshadri Swamigal used to go to bazaar shops the scatter the   
toffees, toy baloons, and other things. The shopkeepers would   
keep quiet. Because if he had touched, then trade would go on a glorious  
scale! That is why he is called Thanga Kai - Golden Hand.   
For Seshadri Swamigal's Maha Samadhi, Bhagavan Ramana referred to Tirumoolar's  
Tirumandiram and told Swami's devotees, as to how to make a Samadhi pit etc.,  
He also went there and attended the ceremonies for 6 hours.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear prasanth,   
Seshadri Swamigal before he left Kanchipuram for Tiruvannamalai,   
his mother who was quite ill hit his chest three times saying,   
Arunachala, Arunachala, Arunachala and then she passed away.   
Seshadri Swamigal took it as Mother's Upadesa and quickly left   
for Tiruvannamalai.   
Seshadri Swamigal had a lot of siddhic powers. He has exhibited   
this with various devotees. As Bhagavan Ramana said: "These   
siddhis will come only when there is a mind to work on them."   
All the same, Bhagavan Ramana had great regard for Seshadri   
Swamigal. Once on the Hill, Seshadri Swamigal was intently looking   
at Bhagavan Ramana. Bhagavan Ramana also looked at him.   
Finally, Seshadri Swamigal said: "I am not able to understand what   
It thinks!" He knew that Bhagavan Ramana had no thoughts at all.   
Arunachala Siva.

Seshadri Swamigal 's biography came in Tamizh first in 1939.   
This was done by one Kuzhumani Narayana Sastrigal from Vellore.   
He was a devotee of both Seshadri Swamigal and Bhagavan Ramana.   
He has himself acknowledged in his Tamizh book, that B. V.   
Narasimha Swami [the author of Self Realization] had given him,   
quite of a lot of details and anecdotes, some 150 pieces.   
The book was translated into English by one S.A. Subramanian,   
and published first by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan in 1998.   
Arunachala Siva.
