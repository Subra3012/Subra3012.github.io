## Sri Bhagavan's Advent Day - 01.90.2014

Venkataraman's changed mode of life caused friction. School work was more  
neglected than ever, and, even though it   
was not now for games but for prayer and meditation, his uncle and elder  
brother increasingly critical of what seemed   
to them an unpractical attitude. From their point of view, Venkataraman was  
simply the adolescent son of a middle   
class family who should pull his weight and equip himself to earn money and  
help the others.   
The crisis came on August 29th, some six weeks after the Awakening. (The  
exact date has been fixed as 10th   
July 1896, by Gayatri Devi Vasudev, niece of famous astrologer B. V. Raman).  
Venkataraman had been given an   
exercise in Bain's English Grammar to copy out three times. It was the  
forenoon and he was sitting upstairs in   
the same room with his elder brother. He had copied it out twice and was  
about to do so for the third time when   
the futility of it stuck him so forcibly that he pushed away the papers and  
sitting cross legged, abandoned himself   
to meditation.   
Annoyed at the sight Nagaswami, the elder brother chided him. He rose to the  
feet and decided to leave the house   
there and then and go forth renouncing everything. For him that meant  
Tiruvannamalai and the holy Hill,   
Arunachala.   
However, he knew that it was necessary to use a guile, because authority is  
very strong in a Hindu household   
and his uncle and brother would not let him go if they knew. So he said that  
he had to go back to school to attend   
a special class on electricity.,   
His brother said, 'Then take five rupees from the box downstairs and pay my  
college fees on the way.'

Venkataraman's aunt was downstairs. She gave him a meal. Then he took the  
five rupees from the box. There was an   
atlas there and he opened it and found that the nearest station is Tindivanam.  
But the atlas was an old one and did not   
show that a branch line had already been constructed to Tiruvannamalai.  
Estimating that three rupees would be enough   
for the journey, he took only so much. He wrote a letter to his brother to  
allay anxiety and left the two rupees with it.   
The letter ran: I have set out in quest of my Father, in accordance with His command. It is  
on a virtuous enterprise that this has   
embarked, Therefore, none grieve over this act, and let no money be spent in  
search of this. Your college fees have   
not been paid. Two rupees are enclosed herewith.   
The whole incident illustrates Sri Bhagavan's saying that his soul, loosened  
from its anchorage to the body, was still   
seeking permanent anchorage in the Self with which he had realized his  
Oneness. The subterfuge about the electricity   
class, harmless though it was, would not have been possible later. Neither  
would the idea of a quest, for he who has   
found does not seek.   
It was about noon when he left home. However, late though, he was, the train  
had not yet arrived when he reached   
the station. There was a table of fares and he looked up the third class fare  
to Tindivanam and found it to be two   
rupees and three annas. He bought a ticket leaving himself three annas  
change. Had he looked a few lines lower down   
he would have seen the name Tiruvannamalai and that the fare to it was exactly  
three rupees!

The events of the journey are symbolical of the arduous journey an aspirant  
(sadhaka), make to his goal. First there   
was the favor of Providence in granting the money and allowing the train to  
be caught, although he started out late.   
Then the provision made was exactly what was needed to reach the destination  
but the heedlessness of the traveller   
lengthened the journey and caused hardships and adventures on the way.   
Venkataraman sat silent among the passengers, lost in the exultation of his  
quest. Several stations passed thus.,   
A white bearded Maulvi who had beeen enlarging on the lives and teaching of  
the saints turned to him: 'And where are you going, Swami?'   
'To Tiruvannamalai.'   
'So am I' replied the Maulvi.   
'What! To Tiruvannamalai?'   
'Not exactly but to the next station.'   
'What is the next station?'   
'Tirukoilyur'   
Then, suspecting his mistake, Venkataraman, exclaimed in surprise. 'What! You  
mean the train goes to Tiruvannamalai?'   
'A strange passenger, you' rejoned the Maulvi. 'And where did you buy a ticket  
to?'   
"To Tindivanam'.   
'Oh dear! There is no need to go so far at all. We get out at Villupuram  
Junction and change there for Tiruvannamalai   
and Tirukoilur.'   
Providence having given him the needed information, Venkataraman sank once  
more into the bliss of Samadhi. By   
sunset the train had reached Tiruchirapalli and he began to feel hungry, so he  
spent half an anna on two country pears,   
koyya pazham, that is huge. To his surprise his appetite was sated almost at  
the first bite though up till then he had always   
eaten heartily. He continued in a blissful state of waking sleep until the  
train reached Villupuram at 3 O clock in the morning.   
He remained at the station till day break and then wandered out into the town  
to look for the road to Tiruvannamalai,   
deciding to walk the rest of the way. However the name board was not found.   
Feeling tired, he entered a hotel and asked for food. The hotel keeper told  
him and immediately lapsed into meditation.   
The meal came, and after eating it, he proffered two annas in payment. But  
the hotel keeper must have been struck   
by this fine looking Brahmin youth with long hair and gold ear rings sitting  
there like a sadhu. He found that Venkataraman   
had not enough money, he refused to accept any payment. He also explained  
that Mambalapattu, a name that Venkataraman   
had seen on a sign post, was on the way to Tiruvannamalai. Venkataraman  
thereupon returned to the station and bought   
a ticket for Mambalapattu, which as far as his remaining annas would take him.   
He reached Mambalapattu in the afternoon and from there set out to walk. By  
nightfall, he had gone ten miles. Before him   
was the temple of Araiyanainallur built on a large rock. The long walk, most  
of it in the heat of the day, had tired him   
and he sat down by the temple to rest. Shortly after that, someone came along  
and opened it for the temple priest   
and others to make puja. Venkataraman entered and sat down in the pillared  
hall, the only part that was not yet   
quite dark. He immediately beheld a brilliant light pervading the whole  
temple. Thinking it must be an emanation from the   
image of the God in the inner sanctuary, he went to look but found that it was  
not. Nor was it any physical light. It disappeared   
and he sat down in meditation.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.

He was soon disturbed by the cook calling out that it was time to lock up the  
temple, as the puja was finished. Thereupon,   
he approached the priest and asked if they had anything for him to eat but  
was told that there was nothing. He then asked   
to be allowed to stay there till morning but was also refused. The pujaris  
said they were going to Kilur about three quarters   
of a mile away, to perform puja at the temple there as well, and that after  
that he might get something to eat, so he accompanied   
them. As soon as they entered the temple, he was again plunged in the  
blissful absorption called Samadhi. It was 9 O clock   
by the time the puja was finished and they sat down to supper. Again  
Venkataraman asked. It seemed at first that there would   
be nothing for him, but the temple drummer had been impressed by his  
appearance, and devout manner and gave him his share.   
He wanted water to drink with it, and, holding his leaf plate with rice, was  
shown the way to the house of a Sastri nearby   
would give him water. While standing in front of the house, waiting for it,  
he stumbled on a few paces and then collapsed   
in sleep or faint. A few minutes later, he came round to find a small crowd  
looking on curiously. He drank the water, gathered   
up and ate some of the rice that has spilled, and then lay down on the ground  
and slept.   
Next morning, Monday, August 31st, was Gokulashtami the birth anniversary of  
Sri Krishna and one of the most auspicious   
days in Hindu calendar. Tiruvannmalai was still twenty miles distant.  
Venkataraman walked for some time, looking for the road   
to it and and began to feel tired and hungry. Like most Brahmins at a time  
when ancient times still held more away than   
they do today, he wore gold ear rings, and in his case, they were set with  
rubies. He took them off in order to raise money   
on them and finish the journey by train. But the question was, where and with  
whom?

He stopped at random at a house which turned out to be one Muthukrishna  
Bhagavatar and asked for food. The sister of   
Bhagavatar, must have been deeply impressed by the appearance at her door of a  
Brahmin youth of beautiful countenance   
and shining eyes on the day of Krishna's birth; she gave him a large cold  
meal and although, as in the train two days ago,   
his appetite disappeared after first mouthful, she stood over him in true  
motherly fashion and made him finish it.   
There remained the question of ear rings. They must be worth twenty rupees  
but he wanted a loan of four on them   
to cover any more expenses he might have on his way. To avoid arousing  
suspicion he gave the pretext that he was   
on a pilgrimage and his luggage had got lost, leaving him destitute.  
Muthukrishna Bhagavatar examined the ear rings   
and, judging them to be genuine, advanced four rupees. However, he insisted  
on taking the youth's address, and giving   
his own so that they could be redeemed, at anytime. The good couple kept with  
him till noon and then gave him lunch   
and packed up for him a parcel of sweets that had been prepared for puja to  
Sri Krishna, but not yet offered to Him.   
As soon as he left the house, he tore up the address, having no intention of  
ever redeeming the ear rings. Finding   
that there was no train to Tiruvannmalai, till next morning, he slept at night  
at the station. No man can end his journey   
till the allotted time. It was morning of September 1st, 1896, three days  
after leaving home, when he arrived at   
Tiruvannamalai Station.

With quick steps, his heart throbbing with joy, he hastened straight to the  
great Temple. In mute sigh of welcome, the   
gates of three high compound walls and all the doors, even that of the inner  
shrine stood open. There was no else inside.   
So he entered the inner shrine alone and stood overcome before His Father  
Arunachala. He embraced the Lingam and there   
in the bliss of the Union, was the quest achieved and the journey ended.   
Leaving the Temple, Venkataraman wandered out into the town. Someone called  
out to ask him whether he wanted his   
tuft removed. The question must have been inspired, for there was no outer  
sign that Brahmin youth renounced or intended   
to renounce the world. He immediately consented and was conducted to the  
Ayyankulam Tank where a number of barbers   
plied with their trade. There he had to his head completely shaved. Then,  
standing on the steps of the tank, he threw away   
his remaining money -- a little over three rupees. He never handled money  
again. He also threw away the packet of sweets   
which he was still holding. 'Why give sweets to this block of a body?' He  
took of the sacred thread that is a sign of caste   
and threw it away, for he who renounces the world renounces not only home and  
property but caste also and all civil status.   
Then he took off the dhoti he was wearing, tore off a strip to serve him as a  
loin cloth, and threw the rest away.   
So he returned to the temple, having completed the acts of renunciation. As he  
approached it he recollected that the Scriptures   
enjoin a bath after having one's hair cut, but he said to himself, 'Why give  
this block of a body the luxury of a bath?'   
Immediately there was a short and sharp shower so that before entering the  
Temple he had his bath!   
He did not re-enter the inner shrine. There was no need. Indeed, it was three  
years, before he went there again.   
He took his abode in the thousand pillared hall, a raised stone platform, open  
on all sides, the roof supported by a forest   
of slender, sculptured pillars and there sat in the Bliss of Being.   
Sri Bhagavan's Advent is complete!   
It was Tuesday, 1st Sept. 1896.   
concluded.   
Arunachala Siva.

the day I started my Yoga journey in the late 90s and ever thankful to my Yoga  
Guru Swami Sivananda for putting me on this path and guiding me through his  
grace. On this day I want to share the experience of Former President of India  
Dr.Abdul Kalam when he met Swami Sivananda in Rishikesh in 1958 utterly  
dejected because he was not selected for the Airforce. How Swami Sivananda  
consoled him and gave him hope and told him to defeat his defeatist tendency  
is mentioned here by Dr.Kalam himself and this message is not just to  
Dr.Kalam but to all of us. **

**_Trials, difficulties, troubles and sufferings are necessary for your  
purification and to strengthen your will and power of endurance. Face them  
bravely and come out triumphantly. Press on. Strive on with all your will;  
only then is the grace of God bestowed. God helps those who help themselves.  
If bad thoughts enter your mind, simply ignore them. Offer a prayer to the  
Lord and substitute divine thoughts by studying the sacred books. The  
spiritual fire should be generated day after day. Hold fast to the ideal. Keep  
the flame of aspiration ever bright. Scorn mundane delights and strife.  
Dedicate your life to God. Meditate. Scale the spirit 's steepest height and  
reach the peak of eternal wisdom and bliss divine. Nothing is able to daunt  
the firm and resolute aspirant or turn him from a course which he considers to  
be right, or which he holds to be his duty. Be brave and courageous. You must  
pass with one breath over the mountain of difficulties. The atman cannot be  
attained by a life of weakness and error.   
You have infinite strength within you. Be strong. Look within. Meditate. Tap  
the source. Have an indomitable will, backed by an abiding faith. You are  
bound to succeed in everything. God is the light of lights. He is knowledge.  
He is the knower. God is the same from age to age. God never changes; he is  
ageless. God has no opposite. God is truth, beauty, goodness. God has no  
religion; He is the source of all religion. God is one. God is peace. God is  
universal harmony. God is love and law. As a lamp cannot burn without oil, so  
man cannot live without God. Creation reveals that God is dharma  
(righteousness). God is the bestower of grace which is boundless and  
inexhaustible._**

**Gayatri Japa**   
by Swami Sivananda ? In The divine Life Society**   
"Let us meditate on Isvara and His Glory who has created the Universe, who is  
fit to be worshipped, who is the remover of all sins and ignorance. May he  
enlighten our intellect. "   
The aspirant prays to Mother Gayatri, "O Beloved Mother! At the present moment  
I have taken my body as the self owing to Avidya or ignorance, through my  
impure intellect. Give me a pure intellect which will enable me to know my  
real nature. Give me light and knowledge. "   
This is the Brahma-Gayatri Mantra. Gayatri is the 'Blessed Mother' of Vedas.  
There is no milk superior to cow's milk. Even so there is no Mantra superior  
to Gayatri. As Omkara or Pranava is for Sannyasins, so is Gayatri for  
Brahmacharis and householders. The fruits that are attained by meditation on  
Omkara can be attained by meditation on Gayatri. The same goal that is reached  
by a Paramahamsa Sannyasin can be reached by a Brahmachari or a householder by  
meditating on Gayatri.   
 **Get up at 4 a. m. in Brahmamuhurta and start Japa and meditation on Gayatri  
(Panchmukhi or five-faced Devi seated in lotus flower), sitting on Padmasana,  
Siddhasana or Virasana, facing North or East.**   
Burn incense in the room. In summer you can take a bath. In winter you can  
simply wash your face, hands and feet and do achamana only. Continue the Japa  
for two hours or more.   
Have another sitting at night between 7 and 8 p. m. **Constantly feel that you  
are receiving light, purity and wisdom from Gayatri.** This is important. Keep  
the image of the Gayatri at the Trikuti, the space between the eye-brows by  
closing the eyes and concentrate there, or keep the image in the lotus of the  
heart and concentrate there.   
You will have Darshan of Gayatri.   
 **It is better if you do Japa of Gayatri 3000 to 4000 times daily. Your heart  
will be purified rapidly. If you are not able to do this number, you can do  
1008 times daily. If you find it difficult to do this number also, do at least  
108 times daily, 36 times at sunrise, 36 times at noon, 36 times at sunset.**   
There is special, mysterious spiritual force or wonderful magnetic power at  
Sandhi or junction of the time, sunrise and sunset. The mind will be elevated  
quickly. It will be f **illed with Sattva.   
Concentration will come by itself without any effort at this time. **If you  
find it difficult to get up at Brahmamuhurta, get up before sunrise & Performa  
the Gayatri Mantra.

**Plunge into Sadhana. Start it from today. Regular meditation alone will give  
you the actual realization of the Atman. Get up in the early morning and  
meditate. Withdraw the mind and the senses from the world. Direct the gaze  
within. Do Japa. Pray. There is a great spiritual power in the Lord 's name.  
Have faith. Practise. You will yourself realize this. Be regular in your Japa.  
Meditation will come by itself. The Lord will lead you along the royal road to  
His lotus-feet. Cling to the divine name. It is the supreme saviour in this  
Kali Yuga (present age) **~Swami Sivananda

_This idea of complete self-sacrifice is illustrated in the following story: After the battle of Kurukshetra the five Pandava brothers performed a great  
sacrifice and made very large gifts to the poor. All people expressed  
amazement at the greatness and richness of the sacrifice, and said that such a  
sacrifice the world had never seen before. But, after the ceremony, there came  
a little mongoose, half of whose body was golden, and the other half brown;  
and he began to roll on the floor of the sacrificial hall. He said to those  
around, "You are all liars; this is no sacrifice." "What!" they exclaimed,  
"you say this is no sacrifice; do you not know how money and jewels were  
poured out to the poor and every one became rich and happy? This was the most  
wonderful sacrifice any man ever performed." But the mongoose said, "There was  
once a little village, and in it there dwelt a poor Brahmin with his wife, his  
son, and his son's wife. They were very poor and lived on small gifts made to  
them for preaching and teaching. There came in that land a three years'  
famine, and the poor Brahmin suffered more than ever. At last when the family  
had starved for days, the father brought home one morning a little barley  
flour, which he had been fortunate enough to obtain, and he divided it into  
four parts, one for each member of the family. **They prepared it for their  
meal, and just as they were about to eat, there was a knock at the door. The  
father opened it, and there stood a guest. Now in India a guest is a sacred  
person; he is as a god for the time being, and must be treated as such. So the  
poor Brahmin said, 'Come in, sir; you are welcome,' He set before the guest  
his own portion of the food, which the guest quickly ate and said, 'Oh, sir,  
you have killed me; I have been starving for ten days, and this little bit has  
but increased my hunger.' Then the wife said to her husband, 'Give him my  
share,' but the husband said, 'Not so.' The wife however insisted, saying,  
'Here is a poor man, and it is our duty as householders to see that he is fed,  
and it is my duty as a wife to give him my portion, seeing that you have no  
more to offer him.' Then she gave her share to the guest, which he ate, and  
said he was still burning with hunger. So the son said, 'Take my portion also;  
it is the duty of a son to help his father to fulfil his obligations.' The  
guest ate that, but remained still unsatisfied; so the son's wife gave him her  
portion also. That was sufficient, and the guest departed, blessing them. That  
night those four people died of starvation.** A few granules of that flour had  
fallen on the floor; and when I rolled my body on them, half of it became  
golden, as you see. Since then I have been travelling all over the world,  
hoping to find another sacrifice like that, but nowhere have I found one;  
nowhere else has the other half of my body been turned into gold. That is why  
I say this is no sacrifice."   
This idea of charity is going out of India; great men are becoming fewer and  
fewer. When I was first learning English, I read an English story book in  
which there was a story about a dutiful boy who had gone out to work and had  
given some of his money to his old mother, and this was praised in three or  
four pages. What was that? No Hindu boy can ever understand the moral of that  
story. Now I understand it when I hear the Western idea ? every man for  
himself. And some men take everything for themselves, and fathers and mothers  
and wives and children go to the wall. That should never and nowhere be the  
ideal of the householder.   
Now you see what Karma-Yoga means; even at the point of death to help any one,  
without asking questions. **Be cheated millions of times and never ask a  
question, and never think of what you are doing.** Never vaunt of your gifts  
to the poor or expect their gratitude, but rather be grateful to them for  
giving you the occasion of practicing charity to them. **Thus it is plain that  
to be an ideal householder is a much more difficult task than to be an ideal  
Sannyasin; the true life of work is indeed as hard as, if not harder than, the  
equally true life of renunciation.**_

_It is necessary in the study of Karma-Yoga **to know what duty is**. If I  
have to do something **I must first know that it is my duty, and then I can do  
it.**   
-   
 **Any action that makes us go Godward is a good action, and is our duty; any  
action that makes us go downward is evil, and is not our duty.** From the  
subjective standpoint we may see that certain acts have a tendency to exalt  
and ennoble us, while certain other acts have a tendency to degrade and to  
brutalise us. But it is not possible to make out with certainty which acts  
have which kind of tendency in relation to all persons, of all sorts and  
conditions. There is, however, only one idea of duty which has been  
universally accepted by all mankind, of all ages and sects and countries, and  
that has been summed up in a Sanskrit aphorism thus: **?Do not injure any  
being; not injuring any being is virtue, injuring any being is sin.?**_

_The one point we ought to remember is that **we should always try to see the  
duty of others through their own eyes, and never judge the customs of other  
peoples by our own standard.** I am not the standard of the universe. I have  
to accommodate myself to the world, and not the world to me. So we see that  
environments change the nature of our duties, and doing the duty which is ours  
at any particular time is the best thing we can do in this world. Let us do  
that duty which is ours by birth; and when we have done that, let us do the  
duty which is ours by our position in life and in society._

_One-sidedness is the bane of the world. The more sides you can develop the  
more souls you have, and you can see the universe through all souls - through  
the Bhakta (devotee) and the Jnani (philosopher). Determine your own nature  
and stick to it. Nishtha (devotion to one ideal) is the only method for the  
beginner; but with devotion and sincerity it will lead to all._

Disciple: What ideal should we follow now?   
Swamiji: You have now to make the character of Mahavira your ideal. See how at  
the command of Ramachandra he crossed the ocean. He had no care for life or  
death! He was a perfect master of his senses and wonderfully sagacious. You  
have now to build your life on this great ideal of personal service. Through  
that, all other ideals will gradually manifest in life. Obedience to the Guru  
without questioning, and strict observance of Brahmacharya--this is the secret  
of success. As on the one hand Hanuman represent the ideal of service, so on  
the other hand he represents leonine courage, striking the whole world with  
awe. He has not the least hesitation in sacrificing his life for the good of  
Rama. A supreme indifference to everything except the service of Rama, even to  
the attainment of the status of Brahma and Shiva, the great World-Gods! Only  
the carrying out of Shri Rama's behest is the one vow of this life! Such  
whole-hearted devotion is wanted. Playing on the Khol and Kartal and dancing  
in the frenzy of Kirtana has degenerated the whole people. They are, in the  
first place, a race of dyspeptics--and if in addition to this they dance and  
jump in that way, how can they bear the strain? In trying to imitate the  
highest Sadhana, the preliminary qualification for which is absolute purity,  
they have beenswallowed in dire Tamas. In every district and village you may  
visit, you will find only the sound of the Khol and Kartal! Are not drums made  
in the country? Are not trumpets and kettle-drums available in India? Make the  
boys hear the deep-toned sound of these instruments. Hearing from boyhood the  
sound of these effeminate forms of music and listening to the kirtana, the  
country is well-nigh converted into a country of women. What more degradation  
can you expect? Even the poet's imagination fails to draw this picture! The  
Damaru and horn have to be sounded, drums are to be beaten so as to raise the  
deep and martial notes, and with "Mahavira, Mahavira" on your lips and  
shouting "Hara, Hara, Vyom, Vyom", the quarters are to be reverberated. The  
music which awakens only the softer feelings of man is to be stopped now for  
some time. Stopping the light tunes such as Kheal and Tappa for some time, the  
people are to be accustomed to hear the Dhrupad music. Through the thunder-  
roll of the dignified Vedic hymns, life is to be brought back into the  
country. In everything the austere spirit of heroic manhood is to be revived.  
In following such an ideal lies the good of the people and the country. If you  
can build your character after such an ideal, then a thousand others will  
follow. But take care that you do not swerve an inch from the ideal. Never  
lose heart. In eating, dressing, or lying, in singing or playing, in enjoyment  
or disease, always manifest the highest moral courage. Then only will you  
attain the grace of Mahashakti, the Divine Mother.

All The World's A Stage   
All the world's a stage,   
And all the men and women merely players;   
They have their exits and their entrances,   
And one man in his time plays many parts,   
His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,   
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.   
Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel   
And shining morning face, creeping like snail   
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,   
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad   
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,   
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,   
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,   
Seeking the bubble reputation   
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,   
In fair round belly with good capon lined,   
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,   
Full of wise saws and modern instances;   
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts   
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,   
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;   
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide   
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,   
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes   
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,   
That ends this strange eventful history,   
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,   
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.   
As You Like It, Sri William Shakespeare

**_Not Here   
There's courage involved   
if you want to become truth.   
There is a broken-open place   
in a lover   
Where are those qualities   
of bravery and sharp compassion in this gruop?   
What's the use   
of old and frozen thought?   
I want a howling hurt   
This is not a treasury   
where gold is stored;   
this is for copper.   
We alchemists look for talent   
that can heat up and change.   
Lukewarm won't do.   
Halfhearted holding back,   
well-enough getting by?   
Not here.

**_I am the personification of Vedic wisdom, full of austerity,   
 the worshipable master of all the forefathers and a self-realized expert in  
the practice of yoga,   
 yet I could not fathom Him from whom I myself generated.   
 I am [therefore] devoted to the all-auspicious feet of the Lord of the  
surrendered souls,   
which stop the repetition of births and deaths and grant the vision of  
happiness.   
One surely cannot estimate the potency of His personal energies   
\- just like the sky that cannot see its own limit. Therefore, how can others  
know?   
Since neither I, nor you oh sons, nor the Destroyer have an idea of the true  
nature of His movements,   
one cannot expect that the other God-conscious ones would do any better.   
With one's intelligence bewildered by the illusory energy of what is created   
one is only able to see as far as one's abilty reaches.   
Srimad Bhagavatam   
Canto 2,Chapter 6   
Lord Brahma speaking to Sage Narada_**

**_Oceans (Where Feet May Fail)   
You call me out upon the waters   
The great unknown where feet may fail   
And there I find You in the mystery   
In oceans deep   
My faith will stand   
And I will call upon Your name   
And keep my eyes above the waves   
When oceans rise   
My soul will rest in Your embrace   
For I am Yours and You are mine   
Your grace abounds in deepest waters   
Your sovereign hand   
Will be my guide   
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me   
You've never failed and You won't start now   
So I will call upon Your name   
And keep my eyes above the waves   
When oceans rise   
My soul will rest in Your embrace   
For I am Yours and You are mine   
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders   
Let me walk upon the waters   
Wherever You would call me   
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander   
And my faith will be made stronger   
In the presence of my Savior   
I will call upon Your Name   
Keep my eyes above the waves   
My soul will rest in Your embrace   
I am Yours and You are mine.

**_O my God,   
our intoxicated eyes have blurred our vision.   
Our burdens have become heavy, forgive us.   
You are hidden, and yet from East to West You have filled the world with Your  
radiance.   
Your Light is more magnificent than sunrise or sunset,   
and You are the inmost ground of consciousness   
revealing the secrets we hold.   
You are an explosive force causing our damned up rivers to burst forth.   
You whose essence is hidden while   
Your gifts are manifest,   
You are like water and we are like millstones.   
You are like wind and we are like dust.   
The wind is hidden while the dust is plainly seen.   
You are the invisible spring, and we are Your lush garden.   
You are the Spirit of life and we are like hand and foot.   
Spirit causes the hand to close and open.   
You are intelligence; we are Your voice.   
Your intelligence causes this tongue to speak.   
You are joy and we are laughter,   
for we are the result of the blessing of Your joy.   
All our movement is really a continual profession of faith,   
bearing witness to Your eternal power,   
just as the powerful turning of the millstone professes faith in the river?s  
existence.   
Dust settles upon my head and upon my metaphors,   
for You are beyond anything we can ever think or say.   
And yet, this servant cannot stop trying to express Your beauty,   
in every moment, let my soul be Your carpet.   
Rumi

**_If there are a hundred religious books, they are but one chapter: a hundred different religions seek one place of worship.   
All these roads end in one House: all these thousand ears of corn are from one Seed.   
All the hundred thousand sorts of food and drink   
are but one thing if one looks to their final cause.   
When you are entirely satiated with one kind of food,   
fifty other kinds of food become displeasing to your heart.   
In hunger, then, you are seeing double,   
for you have regarded as more than a hundred thousand   
that which is but One.

**KALI THE MOTHER**   
The stars are blotted out,   
The clouds are covering clouds,   
It is darkness vibrant, sonant.   
In the roaring, whirling wind   
Are the souls of a million lunatics   
Just loose from the prison-house,   
Wrenching trees by the roots,   
Sweeping all from the path.   
The sea has joined the fray,   
And swirls up mountain-waves,   
To reach the pitchy sky.   
The flash of lurid light   
Reveals on every side   
A thousand, thousand shades   
Of Death begrimed and black ?   
Scattering plagues and sorrows,   
Dancing mad with joy,   
Come, Mother, come!   
For Terror is Thy name,   
Death is in Thy breath,   
And every shaking step   
Destroys a world for e'er.   
Thou "Time", the All-Destroyer!   
Come, O Mother, come!   
Who dares misery love,   
And hug the form of Death,   
Dance in Destruction's dance,   
To him the Mother comes.   
Swami Vivekananda

**MAHAKALI**   
Mahakali is of another nature.   
Not of wideness but of height, not wisdom but force and strength are her  
peculiar power. There is in her a overwhelming intensity, a mighty passion of  
force to achieve, a divine violence rushing to shatter every limit and  
obstacle.   
All her divinity leaps out in a splendour of tempestuous action; she is  
therefore swiftness, for the immediately effective process, the rapid and  
direct stroke, the frontal assault that carries everything, before it.   
Terrible is her face to the Asura, dangerous and ruthless her mood against the  
haters of the Divine; for she is the Warrior of the Worlds who never shrinks  
from the battle. Intolerant of imperfection, she deals roughly with all in man  
that is unwilling and she is severe to all that is obstinately ignorant and  
obscure; her wrath is immediate and dire against treachery and falsehood and  
malignity, ill-will is smitten at once by her scourge.   
Indifference, negligence and sloth in the divine work she cannot bear and she  
smites awake at once with sharp pain, if need be, the untimely slumberer and  
the loiterer. The impulses that are swift and straight and frank, the  
movements that are unreserved and absolute, the aspiration that mounts in  
flame are the motion of Mahakali.   
Her spirit is tameless, her vision and will are high and far-reaching like the  
flight of an eagle, her feet are rapid on the upward way and her hands are  
outstretched to strike and to succour.   
For she too is the Mother and her love is as intense as her wrath and she has  
a deep and passionate kindness. When she is allowed to intervene in her  
strength, then in one moment are broken like things without consistence the  
obstacles that immobilise or the enemies that assail the seeker.   
If her anger is dreadful to the hostile and the vehemence of her pressure  
painful to the weak and timid, she is loved and worshipped by the great, the  
strong and the noble; for they feel that her blows beat what is rebellious in  
their material into strength and perfect truth, hammer straight what is wry  
and perverse and expel what is impure or defective.   
But for her what is done in a day might have taken centuries; without her  
Ananda might be wide and grave or soft and sweet and beautiful but would lose  
the flaming joy of its most absolute intensities. To knowledge she gives a  
conquering might, brings to beauty and harmony a high and mounting movement  
and imparts to the slow and difficult labour after perfection an impetus that  
multiplies the power and shortens the long way.   
Nothing can satisfy her that falls short of the supreme ecstasies, the highest  
heights, the noblest aims, the largest vistas. Therefore with her is the  
victorious force of the Divine and it is by grace of her fire and passion and  
speed if the great achievement can be done now than hereafter.   
Sri Aurobindo

**_The temple of love is not love itself;   
True love is the treasure,   
Not the walls about it.   
Do not admire the decoration,   
But involve yourself in the essence,   
The perfume that invades and touches you-   
The beginning and the end.   
Discovered, this replace all else,   
The apparent and the unknowable.   
Time and space are slaves to this presence. _**

bangles ring on   
an ant?s   
wrist   
as they move the earth

law of

**_How humbe is God   
God is the tree in the forests that   
allows itself to die and will not defend itself in front of those   
with the ax, not wanting to cause them   
shame.   
And God is the earth that will allow itself to   
be deformed by man's tools, but He cries; yes, God cries,   
but only in front of His closest ones.   
And a beautiful animal is being beaten to death,   
but nothing can make God break His silence   
to the masses   
and say,   
"Stop, please stop, why are you doing this   
to Me? "   
How humble is God?   
Kabir wept   
when I   
knew.
