**The questioner says** : "I maintain that the physical body of the man sunk  
in samadhi as a result of unbroken contemplation of the Self, becomes  
motionless for that reason. It may be active or inactive. The mind fixed in  
such contemplation will not be affected by the body or the senses being  
restless. A disturbance of the mind is not always the forerunner of physical  
activity. Another man asserts that physical unrest certainly prevents  
nirvikalpa samadhi or unbroken contemplation. What is your opinion? You are  
the standing proof of my statement."   
 **Sri Ramana replied** : "Both of you are right, you refer to sahaja  
nirvikalpa and the other refers to kevala nirvikalpa. In the one case the mind  
lies immersed in the light of the Self (whereas the same lies in the darkness  
of ignorance in deep sleep). The subject discriminates one from the other ?  
samadhi, stirring up from samadhi, and activity thereafter, unrest of the  
body, of the sight, of the vital force and of the mind, the cognizance of  
objects and activity, are all obstructions for him.   
In sahaja, however, the mind has resolved itself into the Self and has been  
lost. Differences and obstructions mentioned above do not therefore exist  
here. The activities of such a being are like the feeding of a somnolent boy,  
perceptible to the onlooker (but not to the subject). The driver sleeping on  
his moving cart is not aware of the motion of the cart, because his mind is  
sunk in darkness. Similarly the sahaja jnani (liberated sage) remains unaware  
of his bodily activities because his mind is dead, having been resolved in the  
ecstasy of Awareness (Self)."

**The next day Sri Bhagavan said** : These people want some japa, dhyana, or  
yoga or something similar. Without their saying what they have been doing so  
far what more can be said to them? Again, why japa, its phalasruti, etc.? Who  
is it that makes the japa? Who gets the fruits thereof? Can they not look to  
the Self? Or again, even if instructed by others to do japa or dhyana, they do  
it for some time, but are always looking to some results, e.g., visions,  
dreams, or thaumaturgic powers. If they do not find them they say they are not  
progressing or the tapas is not effective. Visions, etc., are no signs of  
progress. Mere performance of tapas is its progress also. Steadiness is what  
is required. Moreover they must entrust themselves to their mantra or their  
God and wait for its Grace. They don?t do so. Japa even once uttered has its  
own good effect, whether the individual is aware or not.

Suppose a child, who is good in drawing and is really very slow in learning  
grammar, then how would the child feel, if it be told, you are bad, and to  
somebody, if we tell he is bad in grammar and keep reminding him about his  
badness to others, then that child would only develop complex and become an  
un-confident person.   
Instead if we focus on the child's abilities of drawing, and praise the child  
to others about his drawing skills, then that child would blossom as great  
flower and would only have positive vibes around him, and he would make others  
smile and happy.   
In the same way, instead of picking up the matters that are in black, from the  
scriptures of all religions, if we picked up the good quotes that makes ones  
faith higher and better that that is Dharma. Not picking the ones that are  
black and in doubt!   
Interpretations are many! Isn't it ridiculous that in one of the Ramayana,  
RAMA IS PORTRAYED AS THE VILLAIN AND RAVANA HAS BEEN PORTRAYED AS THE HERO!   
Recently, a movie was made in Hindi "Raavan" which portrayed Rama in bad shade  
and Ravana as the better person. Such kind of mentality should never be  
encouraged in the name of knowing what is right and wrong, absolutely not at  
the cost of goodness!   
Lets focus only on the positive. Negative spirituality should never be  
encouraged, that which questions ones faith, should be abhorred and be  
rejected as poison.   
**We should make it a habit to never point out the weakness, where ever, what  
ever it may be, including scriptures. Always pointing out the GOOD THINGS in  
everything is the SANATHANA DHARMA way!**

At least Lal Kishan Advani is quite truthful. He has said: All Moslems are  
not terrorists but all terrorists [caught by government   
of India, so far] are Moslems. Dr. Zakir Naik is insane when he says that all  
Moslems should become terrorists.   
The very act of violence is in the blood of most of the Moslems., That is  
why, there is no democracy in almost 99% of Moslem nations.   
Most of them are dictatorships, giving one revolution after another, with no  
stability in government. One dictator leaves his post only   
on his assassination and another dictator comes only to be assassinated after  
a few years. Or some of them are ousted by   
public outrage. This has happened recently with Egypt's Mubarak and Libya's  
Mohammar Gadaffi. Sudan is now erupting.

Subramanian Sir,   
Falsehood spreads like virus. Such people are virus really - They have their  
own interpretations of Quran, and in the name of Jihad, they do all nonsense.  
Some countries, they kill person, if they are found doing some silly mistakes,  
they are killed, by throwing stones and what not!   
But, what I felt is, instead of referring to these incidents, if we ourselves,  
pick some verses from Quran and look for its meaning and essence, then, we  
will see the true essence of those verses, We should never take some  
commentary blindly! after all a commentary is mind's work and that  
commentators personal agenda would be incorporated in that work. That is why,  
I have been stressing, instead of quoting, who criticized what, and what has  
been criticized, if we quote "quotable quotes" that is great dharma, great  
Yajna, great sacrifice especially in this kali yuga!   
 **When we talk about Muslims, instead of talking about Gaddafi, Osama Bin  
Laden and Mubarak, Zakir Naik, WE CAN TALK ABOUT DR. APJ ABDUL KALAM, Akbar,  
etc...** that would make our muslim brethren feel secured, and would stop the  
hatred for them in our heart also (which is most important - that is what is  
happening) instead if we keep talking about the negative evils, that makes  
them rebel, and hate feelings creeps within ourselves! Because of some, many  
are hurt, the community is branded. just because some small drop of  
controversies and evil spreads like virus! When one is hurt what needs is not  
criticisms but words of "Hitham" Good positivity, Hope, happiness!   
 **Talk only good, for it is really for thyself alone!** when we talk bad  
about others, it creates hatred in us!   
We should have that positive dimension... and positive outlook. The world  
needs that now. This is what i stress upon.. this is more important i felt.   
similarly to the Christians and other Hindus as well. Everybody!   
The Avatar of Kabir Shirdi Sai Baba throws much light on these aspects! by  
doing this, we are doing Dharma. Dharmo Rakshati Rakshatah

Nagaraj garu,   
That 2009 movie raavan you are talking about is directed by Mani Ratnam sir.   
I think He wants to highlight dravida samskruthi which is very bad.   
We all know how much extent some tamilians like periyar nand his wife went by  
throwing lord rama's idols in fire and praising ravana.   
Even so called Mr Karunadhi also famously questioned Lord rama by asking "who  
is lord rama and from which engineering college did he gradudated.." thanks to  
mature tamilian like Subramanian swamy he made sure Mr karunanidhi know the  
basics.

Dear friends, I am afraid that every religion possesses element of fanaticism.  
Even in Hinduism - vaishnavism, saivism, shaktism, ganapatya. All of them like  
christianity and islam teach that their views are "right" and only their God  
is real or supreme. From my observations vaishnavas are the most intolerant  
among hinduists. Like they have a patent for Krishna or Rama and all other  
Gods are inferior and unimportant. May be the situation with the other  
denomination is the same. I cannot say. I have faced only with Hare Krishna  
community personally because I am not from India. They are so intolerant. The  
only difference from the christianity of the Middle Ages is that they didn't  
kill anybody in the name of their faith. They call others stupid, ignorant and  
so on. It's a part of every religion and culture.   
Dear friends, brothers and sisters. Let they do what they are predestined to  
do. What they do is not their choice. Don't hate anybody, say ill to none!  
Don't judge! Be tolerant, patient and positive. Follow what you believe and go  
ahead! On this occasion I will quote two of my favorite Bible quotes: Quote  
> âDo not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will  
> not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. Give, and it will be  
> given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running  
> over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be  
> measured to you.â   
> Luke 6:37, 38  
Quote  
> Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together.  
> One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: > âTeacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?â Jesus replied: > ââLove the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and  
> with all your mind.â This is the first and greatest commandment. And the  
> second is like it: âLove your neighbor as yourself.â **All the Law and  
> the Prophets hang on these two commandments**.â   
> Matthew 22:34-40

Dear prasanth,   
You should be knowing some truths about answers given to Periyar and  
Karunanidhi: 1\. When K asked what engg college Rama studied, one simple reader of the  
Hindu asked him: What engineering college   
Karikal Chozhan studied, since he has built Grand Anicut in Thanjavur  
district, a dam which has no seen any major repairs   
since 1000 years! What engg college did King Raja Raja study, to build  
Thanjavur Big Temple, in which the single tower   
in the middle is an architectural marvel. This temple is also 1000 years old.   
2\. Periyar had a Vinayaka Temple inside his house!   
3\. When Karunanidhi was arrested by Jayalalitha during her earlier tenure  
about 10 years back, in the midnight, and when   
police pushed him to the downstairs to get into the jeep, he cried, Ayyo,  
Muruga, they are going to kill me. Muruga save me!   
This video clipping was shown in Sun TV!   
4\. For attaining bail for Kanimozhi, her mother Rajathi, one of the three  
wives of K is going for Navagraha Pradakshina every   
day in Chennai in an obscure temple, without anyone knowing it.   
5\. Poor Raja has not such godly supporters for him to do archana and  
pradakshina for Navagraha!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Prashant ji, just want to point out that Dravida Samskara is not what  
what Mani Ratnam portrayed or what Periyar or Karunanidhi portray, that is  
wrong. Dravida Samskara is Vedic Samskara.   
Equating Dravida with DMK party or ADMK party and periyar or karunanidhi is  
wrong. What these people portray is far from the true spirit of Dravida.   
Another myth is the Aryan-Dravidian theory. Some westerner interpretted the  
Aryans as white skinned and Dravidians as black skins, and in the vedic  
mantras there are many versed that portray fight between the whites and black  
which really meant the fight between the Asuras and Suras (Devas) **actually a  
fight between the Good and Bad within oneself,** but the westerners  
interpretted this as white and black and created an artificial divide between  
the Aryans and Dravidians. This did not exist before 200 years.   
Dravidian samskara goes back to Agastya, Murugan, Cholas, Pandyas. Not Mani  
Ratnam, Karunanidhi or Periyar....   
True Dravidian Samskara, you can find in the Nayanmar stories, from the very  
many tamil stories.

Dear Ramana,   
That is beautifully conveyed - "Tolerance" has to be our (a Sadhaka) staple  
diet.   
There is one beautiful verse of wisdom in sanskrit -   
**प िण्डे पिण्डे मतिर्भिन्ना कुण्डे कुण्डे नवं पय: जातौ जातौ नवाचारा: नवा वाणी मुखे मुखे  
 **Varied is the intellect in different people; varied is the (taste in) water  
from different sources; varied are the customs for different descents; varied  
are the speech from different visages.**   
 **Each person (pinDah) has different aptitude / opinion (no two brains are  
alike). water in different ponds differ. different casts / communities have  
their own ways of life. ( they have their own rules and regulations etc.) each  
mouth speaks different language. There is a diversity in this world. No two  
things are same. This to some extent explains our (Sanatana Dharma) tolerance  
towards different religions / cultures. we accept that all cant be same. By  
this we alow other to be 'different' and follow their own way.**   
 **ध र्म यो बाधते धर्मा न स धर्मः कुधर्मकः ।   
अविरोधात्तु यो धर्मः स धर्मः सत्यविक्रम ॥**   
 **That faith (dharma) which opposes another faith is not a real faith. Its  
fake. That faith which believes in univeral tolerance is the real faith.**   
Salutations to Bhagavan

Very profound verse indeed, Nagaraj! Thank you! This reminded me about a part  
of Dhammapada of Lord Buddha. He has said: Quote  
> "Look how he abused me and hurt me,   
> How he threw me down and robbed me."   
> Live with such thoughts and you live in hate.   
> "Look how he abused me and hurt me,   
> How he threw me down and robbed me."   
> Abandon such thoughts, and live in love.   
> In this world   
> Hate never yet dispelled hate.   
> Only love dispels hate.   
> This is the law,   
> Ancient and inexhaustible.

Excellent quote ramana ! here are some more nice quotes of sai baba -   
Live together, revere each other, let not the seeds of envy and hate grow and choke the clear stream of Love.  
There is only one royal road for the spiritual journey...Love Be Silent yourself, that will induce Silence in others.  
Love all men without distinction, Know that mankind is a single community.   
\- Ego lives by getting and forgetting;   
\- Love lives by giving and forgiving;   
\- Love is expansion;   
\- Self is contraction;   
\- Self is lovelessness;   
\- Love is selflessness.

Thank you, Nagaraj! And because this topic is about Christianity and Advaita I  
want to post this symbol and we never to forget one of its most profound  
meanings which is "Kill the ego and be free": « _Last Edit: October 29, 2011, 11:01:21 PM by ramana1359_

well said subramanian garu and yes that is a slapping reply by the hindu  
reader.   
nagaraj garu yes you are right sir few people like mani ratnam etc are mis-  
intrepreting dravida samsruthi and thanks for letting us know about the truths  
sir.   
Dear ramana,   
Those bible quotes are great but honestly i feel the depth which sanatana  
dharma scriptures have is missing in other scriptures like bible,quran etc.   
All other scriptures don't really touch on root causes of misery like  
desires,ego,attachment,5 elements in nature,3 gunas etc etc.   
If you read scriptures like bhagavad gita you will know from where i am coming  
from.   
Other scriptures like bible and quran are probably good for starters like they  
say "Do Good See Good Be Good" to all and your neighbours etc etc but don't  
really stress on why we should do good etc.   
If one is serious and want to understand within then sanatana dharma is the  
final destination is my personal opinion.

This article gives details regarding Jesus In India   
http://www.sol.com.au/kor/7_01.htm   
However there is one theory which says that there is no historical evidence  
whatsoever about the life and death of jesus.   
They say jesus appears to be a mythical figure created to destabilise Judaism.   
Anyways there are various theories and we donot know what is real and i  
suggest we stop discussing about other gods and their teachings and  
concentrate on bhagavan ramana.

Prasanth, it seems you are not inclined to Jesus and Muhammad teachings. If I  
am right there is nothing wrong with it.   
We cannot ignore and the stigma the church has put on Jesus' pure teachings,  
nor the muslim's fanatical interpetation of the Quran over the centuries. But  
it doesn't mean that they are wrong or inferior. Their teachings were  
according to the spiritual maturity of the community they have spoken of. The  
cows can have different colors of the skin but they all give white milk. The  
mature spiritual seeker will behave properly, speak truthfully, act rightly no  
matter what his/her religion is. Christianity is not only the church.  
Gnosticism and mystical christianity are counterparts of Hindu's Advaita.  
Sufism is the muslim accordance of nonduality. The differences and the names  
come from the mind - our dear friend and the greatest enemy.

Dear ramana sir,   
I 100% agree with you andi.   
As you said their teachings were according to the spiritual maturity of the  
community they have spoken of.
