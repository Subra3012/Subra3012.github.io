**Need for daily self analysis   
Daily self-analysis or self-examination is an indispensable requisite. Then  
alone can you remove your defects and can grow rapidly in spirituality. A  
gardener watches the young plants very carefully. He removes the weeds daily.  
He puts a strong fence around them. He waters them at the proper time. Then  
alone they grow beautifully and yield fruits quickly. Even so, you should find  
out your defects through daily introspection and self-analysis and then  
eradicate them through suitable methods~Swami Sivananda**

Advice to spiritual aspirants - retire periodically from worldly atmosphere   
The life of a spiritual aspirant in the world is verily like a fierce struggle  
and fight with deadly serpent. Samsara or worldly life is a terrible and  
deadly serpent. Man must keep constant and alert watchfulness lest the  
Samsara-sarpa take you unawares. Keep the twin eyes of Viveka (discrimination)  
and Vichara (enquiry) wide open. At times the man becomes poisoned in the  
course of his Vyavahara (worldly activities). He must retire periodically from  
the worldly atmosphere and take recourse to Satsanga (association with the  
wise), Sadhana, seclusion and silent meditation~Swami Sivananda**

**Here is an excellent view from Swami Satyananda ( Disciple of Swami  
Sivananda and also founder of Bihar School of Yoga ) on Swami Sivananda 's  
Innocent Faith and Purity   
Swami Sivananda was not intellectual; he was purely a bhakta, with a very  
innocent mind. If anyone came to him or wrote to him with problems, at once he  
would ask everybody to please sit down, close their eyes and repeat the mantra  
for that person's recovery. He had such faith that immediately after the  
mantra was repeated, he would have us write a letter saying, 'We have  
conducted the mantra prayer for you and now you will be alright.'   
Unless you have faith, you cannot believe in this. We are all intellectuals.  
We know all the mantras, but we have no faith in them. If we practise a mantra  
for someone who is sick, we will not dare to write and tell him, because we  
cannot be sure he has gotten better. Whereas faith leaves no room for doubt,  
knowledge has fissures in it. I am not against intellect, but at the same time  
its limitations must be pointed out.   
Faith is very innocent but it is so powerful that the miracles you see in the  
lives of the great saints are a product of that innocence. Innocence is not  
childishness; it is the blossoming of the purity in man's structure. To be  
innocent you don't have to do anything or be anything. Rather, whatever you  
have acquired you have to throw away: knowledge, proceeds, wealth, power,  
status and political and religious background. You have to believe, 'I am  
nothing.' When this attitude takes hold within you, it becomes the centre of  
faith and in Swami Sivananda I found this faith in absolutely living form.**

Note : Most of the messages of Swami Sivananda here will be directed to the  
Mind, Body and not to Atma ( which is what Bhagavan Ramana always points to )  
.This should not be seen as a contradiction as Swami Sivananda's advise to  
aspirants is to first prepare the mind and body before you focus on Atma and  
the reasons are given below . **   
 **When it comes to Swami Sivananda 's Teachings, I wish to point out that his  
teachings will be a combination of Yoga and Vedanta. He combined the  
teachings of both Yoga and Vedanta and in fact he started the first Yoga  
Vedanta Forest Academy in Rishikesh to train spiritual aspirants in the  
Science of Yoga & Vedanta. He used the Science of Hatha Yoga, Raja Yoga and  
also Bhakti Yoga to basically prepare the body, mind & heart to make it fit  
to receive the Atma Jnana i.e preparing the body ( Hatha Yoga ), mind ( Raja  
Yoga ) and heart( Bhakthi Yoga ) . In fact his entire mission was to prepare  
a spiritual aspirant fit enough for Atma Jnana. In traditional terminology  
this qualification is called "Sadhana Chatusthaya- Four Fold Qualifications "  
.   
But at the same time Swami Sivananda knew that few aspirants are very ripe and  
they do not need this preliminary steps and are fully qualified for Atma Jnana  
and he used to pick those people and send them to Swami Tapovan for receiving  
Atma Jnana. In his book "Sadhana Chatushtaya ", Swami Sivananda has mentioned  
in the end of the book that there are few people who may feel that going  
through all these preliminary disciplines are too time consuming and they just  
want to go ahead with the direct path and Swami Sivananda has welcomed that  
approach also. He considered such aspirants to be highly mature and they are  
fit for the direct path from the start itself.   
This is what Swami Sivananda has said in conclusion : "A first class student can adopt this method, because he had cultivated the  
four means in his previous birth. A mediocre student will not be able to think  
of Brahman at the very outset. How can one think of Brahman when the mind is  
filled with impurities, when it is turbulent and the senses are jumping and  
revolting ? Absolutely impossible. He may sit for thinking on the Self, but  
he will be building castles in the air and thinking of other objects. He will  
mistake deep sleep for samadhi. Many are delued in this manner. They do not  
have any spiritual progress. They can have no idea of Brahman. It is only the  
mind that is rendered pure by the practice of Viveka, Vairagya, Sama, Dama  
etc that can have the definite conception of Brahman. Ideas of Brahman cannot  
be lodged in a restless, impure mind. "- Swami Sivananda  
**The reason why I am sharing the above message is that I have myself gone  
through the Yoga Training of Swami Sivananda through the institution of one  
of his senior disciple by name Swami Vishnu devananda who was the founder of  
the International Sivananada Yoga Vedanta Centres worldwide (  
www.sivananda.org and this institution should should not be confused with the  
Divine Life Society / Sivananda Ashram at Rishikesh whose website is  
http://www.sivanandaonline.org/public_html/ ) I did get lot of benefit from  
the same and sharing here some of the good things that I learned from those  
Yoga Sadhanas.

**This is the Mother River Ganga in Rishikesh, Ram Jhula area. The Sivananda  
Ghat is visible. The Sivananda Ashram is much above this . Just like you  
cant separate Arunachala from Bhagavan Ramana, you cant separate Mother Ganga  
from Swami Sivananda. Swami Sivananda's room was on the banks of River Ganga  
adjoining the Ghat. He did not stay in the Ashram but used to go from his  
room up to the Ashram only to Give Talks, Satsangh and supervise the works.   
This is my favorite spot to sit silently during my annual trips to Rishikesh.

**Disciples of Swami Sivananda.   
Swami Sivananda had many disciples but beauty of Swami Sivananda was that he  
shaped some of his disciples to become powerful spiritual lights the world  
over guiding many people . Many of the disciples of Swami Sivananda went all  
over the world and set up institutions carrying his message indifferent forms  
. Some of his notable disciples are : 1) Swami Krishnananda ( a great Vedantic speaker, spiritual writer and  
spiritual guide and who too took over the Divine Life Society in Rishikesh  
after Swami Sivananda's Samadhi ) http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/index.html   
2) Swami Chidananda ( a great Saint and a spiritual guide to many people and  
who also took charge of the Divine Life Society after Swami Sivananda's  
MahaSamadhi ).   
3) Swami Chinmayanada ( a great Vedantic Teacher who started the Chinmaya  
Missions world over. Swami Sivananda was his diksha guru but then later Swami  
Sivananda sent him to Swami Tapovan for Vedantic studies )  
.http://www.chinmayamission.com/   
4) Swami Venkatesananda - a great teacher, speaker and write of spiritual  
books. He is popular for his book on Yoga Vashishta.   
http://www.swamivenkatesananda.org/   
5) Swami Satyananda - again a great Yogi and who started the Bihar School of  
Yoga. He reviewed the Kriya Yoga Sadhana and Many Yoga Sadhana. Bihar School  
of Yoga has published many books on Yoga Sadhana.   
http://www.biharyoga.net/   
6) Swami Satchidananda - a great Yogi who started the Integral Yoga Institute  
in America . His book on Patanjali Yoga Sutra is quite popular.   
http://iyiny.org/ Dr.Dean Ornish who wrote the book "Reversing the Heart  
Disease " was a student of Swami Satchidananda and that book deals with how to  
reverse heart disease through the science of Yoga.   
7) Swami Vishnu devananda - a great Yogi who founded the International  
Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres world over with Head Quarters in Quebec,   
Canada http://www.sivananda.org/. He was a master of Hatha Yoga & Raja Yoga  
and famous for his books "Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga ", "Meditation &  
Mantras ", & commentary on Hatha Yoga Pradipika. He was the first one to  
structure the Yoga Teachings in the ancient Gurukula method of learning  
through his Yoga Teachers Training Courses, Advanced Yoga Taechers Training  
Courses, Sadhana Intensives etc . He did not believe much in giving lectures  
or writing books and wanted people to get immersed in Yoga Sadhana practically  
. He is my Yoga Guru. Even though I have not met him personally I went through  
all the levels of Yoga training in his institute and was fortunate to be  
trained and guided by his direct disciples. The Practical Yoga training that  
I received at the Sivananda Ashrams of Swami Vishnu devananda was the best  
thing that happened in my life.   
8 Swami Chaitanyananda - http://chaitanyadham.tripod.com/ a great Vedantic  
Teacher who remained quite reclusive in the Himalayas in his Uttar Kashi  
Ashram. He was one of the few people ( along with Swami Chinmayananda )  
selected by Swami Sivananda to undergo Vedantic studies under Swami Tapovan.   
Though very reclusive he was well known among the spiritual community in  
Himalayas and was also called as Uttar Kashi Swami. I was blessed to have his  
darshan when he came down from the Himalayas after many decades of stay there  
and had wonderful conversations with him. He cleared many of my spiritual  
doubts, knocked out all the stupid and wrong opinions I had about the  
Vedantic Tradition and other matters pertaining to spirituality and made be  
aware that Yoga Sadhana without Vedantic Study is incomplete and I understood  
the same after I started attending the Vedantic Classes of Swami  
Paramarthananda, a great Vedantic Teacher ( belonging to the Arsha Vidya  
Group of Teachers ).   
The list goes on but these are the most popular ones that I am aware of. **

**HOW GRACE WORKS   
In the beginning we see God's Grace working behind a veil and understand it  
vaguely. As we become purified and our faith in Him increases, we see clearly  
how His Grace works. Then our losses, failures and sorrows have little  
meaning. We see them as opportunities for making our contact with God more  
intimate.   
?Sri Swami Sivananda**

**Law of Retribution   
by Swami Sivananda   
Every wrong action or crime brings its own punishment, in accordance with the  
law of retribution. The law of causation, the law of action and reaction, the  
law of compensation and the law of retribution-all these operate together. He  
who robs another man robs himself. He who hurts another man hurts himself  
first. He who cheats another cheats himself first. Every wrong action causes  
punishment first in the inner nature or soul and externally in circumstances  
in the form of pain, misery, loss, failure, misfortune, disease, etc.   
Man is ignorant. He is swayed by impulses, wrath, passion, attachment, pride  
and repulsion. He does various sorts of wicked actions. His intellect becomes  
perverted. He loses his memory. His understanding gets clouded by selfishness  
and greed. He does not know what he is exactly doing. Later on he repents.  
Discipline of the Indriyas is necessary. He should remember the law of  
causation, the law of action and reaction, and the law of retribution at every  
step, at every moment of his daily life. He should control his emotions and  
impulses through the practice of Pranayama and meditation. Then only will he  
not do any wrong action.   
Remember that God is neither partial nor unjust. You suffer on account of your  
own wicked actions. Sow the seeds which will bring pleasant fruits and which  
will make you happy herein and hereafter. Do not sow the seeds which will  
bring unpleasant fruits and which will make you miserable and unhappy in this  
life or hereafter. Be cautious in doing your daily duties. Watch every  
thought, word and action. Go to the root and purify the thoughts first.  
Prayer, Japa, meditation, study of philosophical books, pure food, Vichara and  
Satsanga will purify your mind and eradicate ignoble and wicked thoughts.  
Observe the vow of silence, you will then be able to control your speech.  
Practise Yama and Niyama, Ahimsa, Satyam, Asteyam, Brahmacharya and  
Aparigraha. Develop Sattvic qualities. Slowly eradicate negative qualities. By  
these practices you will not be able to do any wrong action. The force of  
Sattvic habits will goad you on to do virtuous actions only.   
Orthodox Christians and theologians believe that God settles and fixes the  
destiny of a man before his birth. This is not logical and tenable. The  
hypothesis falls to the ground on account of its unsound nature. Man becomes  
like a piece of straw that is tossed about hither and thither in the wind. He  
has no independence and freedom. This makes God partial, unjust and whimsical.  
The moral responsibility and liberty of a man are destroyed. The man becomes  
like a prisoner whose hands and legs are tied with chains. Why should God make  
one happy and another unhappy? Is He so whimsical and eccentric? Why should  
one get His Grace before he is born? Is he so biased? If God is all-merciful  
why can He not make all equally noble, virtuous, happy, good, moral and  
spiritual? Why is one born blind? Why should a sinner be responsible for his  
actions? Is he pre-ordained to sin? Why should he suffer owing to the whim of  
such a Creator? Questions like these remain a puzzle if you accept the theory  
of 'pre-ordination and Grace'. The doctrine of Karma alone will give  
satisfaction. It is sound. It appeals to reason. It throws a flood of dear  
light. Everyone reaps the fruits of his own actions. Man can do and undo his  
destiny by his own thoughts and character. He is a free agent. He may be a bad  
man in this birth, but he can change his thoughts, habits, tendencies and  
character and can become a good man or a saint in the next birth. He has free  
will. He can choose between two alternatives at every step. The theory of  
'preordination and Grace' cannot be accepted. It falls to the ground as it is  
unsound and untenable.   
The doctrine of Karma only can explain the mysterious problem of good and evil  
in this world. The doctrine of Karma only can bring solace, contentment and  
strength to the afflicted and the desperate. It solves our difficulties and  
problems of life. It gives encouragement to the hopeless and the forlorn. It  
pushes a man to right thinking, right speech and right action. It brings a  
brilliant future for that man who lives according to this universal law. If  
all people understand this law correctly and discharge their daily duties  
carefully they would rise to sublime heights in the ladder of spirituality.  
They will be moral and virtuous and have a happy, peaceful and contented life.  
They can bear the burden of Samsara with patience, endurance and strength of  
mind. There will not be any room for complaint when they see inequalities in  
birth, fortune, intelligence and capacities. There will be heaven on earth.  
All will rejoice even in suffering. Greed, jealousy, hatred, anger and passion  
will vanish. Virtue will reign supreme everywhere. We will have a glorious  
Satyayuga now with peace and plenty everywhere. Blessed is the man who  
understands and lives in the law, for he will soon attain God-consciousness  
and become one with the Law-giver. Then the law will no longer operate on him.

**On The Bhagavad Gita by Swami Krishnananda**   
 **The whole gospel of the Bhagavadgita is nothing but the technique of the  
blending of knowledge and activity. We usually think that knowledge means not  
doing anything and activity means working without knowledge. Sri Krishna tells  
us that knowledge does not mean understanding without work, nor work means  
activity without knowledge. It is very difficult to understand what knowledge  
and action are. Action is the outward expression of knowledge, and knowledge  
is the inner reality of action. This may be said to be the central theme of  
the Bhagavadgita.- Swami Krishnananda**

**HOW TO ACQUIRE GOOD SAMSKARAS   
From the book "Mind Its Mysteries & Control by Swami Sivananda " in Chapter  
-14 Samskaras   
Try to acquire some good spiritual Samskaras in this birth at least, if you  
are not able to   
devote all your time in spiritual pursuit. Do some kind of meditation for a  
short time at least daily,   
say for half an hour in the morning and evening. Have a meditation room. Make  
some kind of Japa   
of any Mantra. Study the Gita regularly. Have Satsanga. Visit Rishikesh,  
Nasik, Varanasi,   
Haridwar, Prayag once a year for a week?s stay. Have the Darshana of Mahatmas.  
By doing so, you   
will acquire some spiritual Samskaras which will be a valuable spiritual asset  
for a new, good life.   
You will have a very good birth. You will be placed in suitable environments  
in the next birth for   
unfolding the Divinity that is lurking in your heart, for practice of Yoga.  
All opportunities and   
facilities will be given to you by God, through His grace (Isvara-Kripa) for  
your spiritual Sadhana.   
Even by a little systematic spiritual practice (Yogabhyasa and Vedantic  
Sadhana), you can change   
your mentality, your old vicious Samskaras. You can cut short several future  
births. By practice for   
three years, you can free yourself from the clutches of births and deaths. You  
are bound to become a   
Sannyasin. Why not now in this very birth? Why don?t you cut short the cycle  
of unnecessary births   
and consequent miseries? How long do you want to be a slave of the world, a  
slave of passions and   
Indriyas? Wake up now. Do Sadhana and get immortality.   
Udharet-Atmana-Atmanam   
Rouse the self by the Self.   
New, healthy Samskaras can be implanted by new, healthy suggestions. Suppose  
your brain   
is a plank in which are driven nails which represent the ideas, habits and  
instincts which determine   
your actions. If you find that there exists in you a bad idea, a bad habit, a  
bad instinct,?a bad nail, as   
it were, in the plank of your mind?you should take another, viz., a good idea,  
habit or instinct,   
place it on the top of the bad one and give a hard tap with a hammer. In other  
words, you should   
make a healthy, useful suggestion. The new nail will be driven in perhaps a  
fraction of an inch while   
the old one will come out to the same extent. At each fresh blow with the  
hammer, that is to say, at   
each fresh suggestion, the one will be driven in a little further and the  
other will be driven out just   
that much until, after a certain number of blows, the old habits will be  
completely replaced by the   
new habits, new ideas. It demands, doubtless, strenuous efforts. It needs  
constant repetition of the   
new, healthy suggestions. Habit is second nature. But, pure, irresistible,  
determined will is bound to   
succeed eventually.   
When you repeat OM or the Mahavakya of the Upanishads Aham Brahma Asmi once,   
one Samskara of the idea that I am Brahman or the Absolute? is formed in the  
subconscious mind.   
The object in doing Japa or silent repetition of OM 21,600 times daily is to  
strengthen this Samskara**

**Man is the Master of his destiny**   
 **" You sow an action and reap a habit; a habit sown results in character.  
You sow a character and reap a destiny. Man is the master of his destiny. You  
yourself make your destiny. You can undo it if you like. All faculties,  
energies and powers are latent in you. Unfold them and become free. There is a  
certain definite connection between what is being now done by you and what  
will happen to you in the future. Sow always the seeds which will bring  
pleasant fruits and which will make you happy herein and hereafter." ~Swami  
Sivananda**

_This idea of complete self-sacrifice is illustrated in the following story: After the battle of Kurukshetra the five Pandava brothers performed a great  
sacrifice and made very large gifts to the poor. All people expressed  
amazement at the greatness and richness of the sacrifice, and said that such a  
sacrifice the world had never seen before. But, after the ceremony, there came  
a little mongoose, half of whose body was golden, and the other half brown;  
and he began to roll on the floor of the sacrificial hall. He said to those  
around, "You are all liars; this is no sacrifice." "What!" they exclaimed,  
"you say this is no sacrifice; do you not know how money and jewels were  
poured out to the poor and every one became rich and happy? This was the most  
wonderful sacrifice any man ever performed." But the mongoose said, "There was  
once a little village, and in it there dwelt a poor Brahmin with his wife, his  
son, and his son's wife. They were very poor and lived on small gifts made to  
them for preaching and teaching. There came in that land a three years'  
famine, and the poor Brahmin suffered more than ever. At last when the family  
had starved for days, the father brought home one morning a little barley  
flour, which he had been fortunate enough to obtain, and he divided it into  
four parts, one for each member of the family. **They prepared it for their  
meal, and just as they were about to eat, there was a knock at the door. The  
father opened it, and there stood a guest. Now in India a guest is a sacred  
person; he is as a god for the time being, and must be treated as such. So the  
poor Brahmin said, 'Come in, sir; you are welcome,' He set before the guest  
his own portion of the food, which the guest quickly ate and said, 'Oh, sir,  
you have killed me; I have been starving for ten days, and this little bit has  
but increased my hunger.' Then the wife said to her husband, 'Give him my  
share,' but the husband said, 'Not so.' The wife however insisted, saying,  
'Here is a poor man, and it is our duty as householders to see that he is fed,  
and it is my duty as a wife to give him my portion, seeing that you have no  
more to offer him.' Then she gave her share to the guest, which he ate, and  
said he was still burning with hunger. So the son said, 'Take my portion also;  
it is the duty of a son to help his father to fulfil his obligations.' The  
guest ate that, but remained still unsatisfied; so the son's wife gave him her  
portion also. That was sufficient, and the guest departed, blessing them. That  
night those four people died of starvation.** A few granules of that flour had  
fallen on the floor; and when I rolled my body on them, half of it became  
golden, as you see. Since then I have been travelling all over the world,  
hoping to find another sacrifice like that, but nowhere have I found one;  
nowhere else has the other half of my body been turned into gold. That is why  
I say this is no sacrifice."   
This idea of charity is going out of India; great men are becoming fewer and  
fewer. When I was first learning English, I read an English story book in  
which there was a story about a dutiful boy who had gone out to work and had  
given some of his money to his old mother, and this was praised in three or  
four pages. What was that? No Hindu boy can ever understand the moral of that  
story. Now I understand it when I hear the Western idea ? every man for  
himself. And some men take everything for themselves, and fathers and mothers  
and wives and children go to the wall. That should never and nowhere be the  
ideal of the householder.   
Now you see what Karma-Yoga means; even at the point of death to help any one,  
without asking questions. **Be cheated millions of times and never ask a  
question, and never think of what you are doing.** Never vaunt of your gifts  
to the poor or expect their gratitude, but rather be grateful to them for  
giving you the occasion of practicing charity to them. **Thus it is plain that  
to be an ideal householder is a much more difficult task than to be an ideal  
Sannyasin; the true life of work is indeed as hard as, if not harder than, the  
equally true life of renunciation.**_

_It is necessary in the study of Karma-Yoga **to know what duty is**. If I  
have to do something **I must first know that it is my duty, and then I can do  
it.**   
-   
 **Any action that makes us go Godward is a good action, and is our duty; any  
action that makes us go downward is evil, and is not our duty.** From the  
subjective standpoint we may see that certain acts have a tendency to exalt  
and ennoble us, while certain other acts have a tendency to degrade and to  
brutalise us. But it is not possible to make out with certainty which acts  
have which kind of tendency in relation to all persons, of all sorts and  
conditions. There is, however, only one idea of duty which has been  
universally accepted by all mankind, of all ages and sects and countries, and  
that has been summed up in a Sanskrit aphorism thus: **?Do not injure any  
being; not injuring any being is virtue, injuring any being is sin.?**_

_The one point we ought to remember is that **we should always try to see the  
duty of others through their own eyes, and never judge the customs of other  
peoples by our own standard.** I am not the standard of the universe. I have  
to accommodate myself to the world, and not the world to me. So we see that  
environments change the nature of our duties, and doing the duty which is ours  
at any particular time is the best thing we can do in this world. Let us do  
that duty which is ours by birth; and when we have done that, let us do the  
duty which is ours by our position in life and in society._

_One-sidedness is the bane of the world. The more sides you can develop the  
more souls you have, and you can see the universe through all souls - through  
the Bhakta (devotee) and the Jnani (philosopher). Determine your own nature  
and stick to it. Nishtha (devotion to one ideal) is the only method for the  
beginner; but with devotion and sincerity it will lead to all._

Disciple: What ideal should we follow now?   
Swamiji: You have now to make the character of Mahavira your ideal. See how at  
the command of Ramachandra he crossed the ocean. He had no care for life or  
death! He was a perfect master of his senses and wonderfully sagacious. You  
have now to build your life on this great ideal of personal service. Through  
that, all other ideals will gradually manifest in life. Obedience to the Guru  
without questioning, and strict observance of Brahmacharya--this is the secret  
of success. As on the one hand Hanuman represent the ideal of service, so on  
the other hand he represents leonine courage, striking the whole world with  
awe. He has not the least hesitation in sacrificing his life for the good of  
Rama. A supreme indifference to everything except the service of Rama, even to  
the attainment of the status of Brahma and Shiva, the great World-Gods! Only  
the carrying out of Shri Rama's behest is the one vow of this life! Such  
whole-hearted devotion is wanted. Playing on the Khol and Kartal and dancing  
in the frenzy of Kirtana has degenerated the whole people. They are, in the  
first place, a race of dyspeptics--and if in addition to this they dance and  
jump in that way, how can they bear the strain? In trying to imitate the  
highest Sadhana, the preliminary qualification for which is absolute purity,  
they have beenswallowed in dire Tamas. In every district and village you may  
visit, you will find only the sound of the Khol and Kartal! Are not drums made  
in the country? Are not trumpets and kettle-drums available in India? Make the  
boys hear the deep-toned sound of these instruments. Hearing from boyhood the  
sound of these effeminate forms of music and listening to the kirtana, the  
country is well-nigh converted into a country of women. What more degradation  
can you expect? Even the poet's imagination fails to draw this picture! The  
Damaru and horn have to be sounded, drums are to be beaten so as to raise the  
deep and martial notes, and with "Mahavira, Mahavira" on your lips and  
shouting "Hara, Hara, Vyom, Vyom", the quarters are to be reverberated. The  
music which awakens only the softer feelings of man is to be stopped now for  
some time. Stopping the light tunes such as Kheal and Tappa for some time, the  
people are to be accustomed to hear the Dhrupad music. Through the thunder-  
roll of the dignified Vedic hymns, life is to be brought back into the  
country. In everything the austere spirit of heroic manhood is to be revived.  
In following such an ideal lies the good of the people and the country. If you  
can build your character after such an ideal, then a thousand others will  
follow. But take care that you do not swerve an inch from the ideal. Never  
lose heart. In eating, dressing, or lying, in singing or playing, in enjoyment  
or disease, always manifest the highest moral courage. Then only will you  
attain the grace of Mahashakti, the Divine Mother.
