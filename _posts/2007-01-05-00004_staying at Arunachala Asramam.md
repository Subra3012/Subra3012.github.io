## staying at Arunachala Asramam

I have checked out both of these new web-sites and note that no-where does it  
mention whether it is still possible to stay at Arunachala Ashramam as in the  
past.   
Can one still do this ? (I haven't been there yet). And will the ashram still  
send-out taxis to the airport as in the past ?   
Thank you,   
Jozia

I think, you better contact Shri Ramanashramam authority. Here is the link to  
"Contact Us" page from the new site: http://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/contactus.html   
That's what I did when I last visited the Ashramam.

in our hearth there is our asram. Rome is very far from Arunachala, but Ramana  
is really present, time and space indipendent
