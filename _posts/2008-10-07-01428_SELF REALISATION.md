Dear sir   
When do the "I" ness i.e. ego the false "I" starts in the system. I forgot  
mine. Now when I see in babies. at the age of 2 they are starting to feel. At  
2 they say this is my doll. She is my mom. Till that time they are pure  
without any stain. That is why we say children and Gods are same.   
This false "I" grows like any thing.It helps for survival in the maya jagat.  
The false "I" grows till it gets self realisation.   
But those who born brahma jnani this false "I" never grow. Am I correct.   
Ramanadli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 False "I"starts with identity with the body.It never gets self realisation.When the identity to the body and mind is nullified   
forever Self reveals spontaneously.This is the so called "self realisation".

Dear Ramanaduli, As Dr. Raju said, the 'I' ness starts the moment   
you identify yourself as the body. In the morning as you wake up,   
you become aware of your body, which was absent during the sleep,   
and with that the 'I'ness, the false ego starts its game.   
Arunachala Siva.

No no sir! Discussing lives of Saints is not just reading from books   
its very enlightening to discuss lives of these saints and see the Scriptures  
revealed through them.   
I think we can discuss. They express scriptures through their lives. ill start  
a small discussion thread on Sri Ramakrishna paramahamsa shortly and if all of  
you are ready to participate, will show how such a discussion can be fruitful   
Love!

Dear Sankar and non duel, What I meant was that the life stories   
of saints can be read from books. After reading such books, the   
purport of the happenings in their lives can be discussed.   
Yesterday, srkuadi, wrote about Sri RK. Now, unless one   
knows about Sri RK and Saradhamani, Sri RK and Mathur Babu,   
or Sri RK and Bhairavi Brahamani, one cannot appreciate the   
the incidents and the purport of such incidents. Hence I   
suggested about reading the books containing the life histories   
of such books.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear sirs   
When I was going through this old mails, I came to know some meber want to  
write about saints life. Our India is punya boomi. It is the heart for the  
whole world to give jnana and spiritualism. From Kashmir to Kanyakumari and  
from east to west we got plenty of saints who took avatar whenever it was  
needed.like samuvami uge uge. Among the saints, some spread bhakti margam like  
meera, some are pure advaitans, They roamed from village to village and they  
sang lots of folk songs, in their respectful languages. Some were sanskrit  
scholars their deciples recorded all in songs form.From south there are so  
many saints. as Subrahmaniyan ji told 63 nayanmar from saivam and 12 Alwars  
from vaishnavam. So we can discuss state by state. There are muslim babas, and  
sufis are also there. We are so fortunate to take birth in India.The tamil  
literature is called Deiva Thamizh. The literature itself contains lots of  
poems about the creator.There are so many siddas who wrote poems and did  
miracles lot still they live around Thruannamalai. Bhagavan also mentioned and  
saw them in His period. If you start this topic. This thread wil be  
everlasting flower in the spiritual garden. We get more chance to know many  
things

Dear Ramanaduli, Thanks for the post. The thread was started   
by Sankar asking for the life stories of saints. I told him that these   
stories can be read from suitable books. We can only discuss   
certain aspects of such stories. The srkudai, started about Sri   
Ramakrishna. I have no problem in narrating the strories. But   
these, as you have said, will be a long serial. Let us see what Bhagavan   
wills.   
Arunachala Siva.
