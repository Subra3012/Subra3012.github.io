There are mantras for invoking various deities. So i was wondering if there  
are mantras for remembering / bringing to the conscious mind / invoking the  
deity of Arunachala....   
Best wishes

The name "Arunachala" by itself is a mahamantra. Saying it once is equal to  
saying OM NAMAH SIVAYA 1 crore times. Even Bhagavan has acknowledged it (Read  
David Godman's website for more info)   
Arunachala = Aruna + achala = Light(knowledge) + unwavering = Illumines your  
SELF.   
Arunachala = A + runa(bondage or karma) + achala = Removes bondage and you  
become fixed in your SELF   
You look at it from any angle it all means the same.   
Mantras help us to get concentrated mind (ekagrata chitta). We have to go  
beyond mantras to be our true SELF.   
Bhagavan says "I" is the greatest of all mantras. Catch the false "I" and it  
will invoke "Arunachala" within you.

Sambhamurthy

Let Arunchala burn all our runa-loan-karma which grows again and again with

Dear vinita,   
Excellent. Arunachala Siva is a Maha mantra. It has helped me   
and many others. And Bhagavan has said it. So, it should help   
you too. A Runa means the Effulgence which burns up all runa,   
debts (of birth, karma, and miseries due to adi bhoudika and adi daivika).   
Arunachala Siva.

Runam means disease also. Is not it.Inastrology they say, 6th place is  
pointing runam. In tamil they we have got 6 enemies. (AARU PAGAIVARGAL)   
but if we surrender to skanda who has got 6 faces, (Aaru Mugan) we can be  
saved. In many places, they mentioned Bhagavan is skanda,   
So He will wipe all the runam for those who surrender to Him and He would  
shower good gunam.

Runam means disease, debts and our dues [like our pitru   
karmas]. Skanda with six faces, will vanquish our six   
diseases or debts. He cleared the debts of devas, when   
Surapadma was ruling over them, and got them back the   
devaloka. Surapadma is the most diabolic rascal, against   
whom Hiraynakashyap, Ravana and Kamsa cannot even   
hold a candle! In his reign, devas went to get fish from   
oceans, Brahma had to stop all births, and Vishnu had   
to remain as a doorman! [Skanda Puranam].   
Arunachala Siva.
