There are mantras for invoking various deities. So i was wondering if there  
are mantras for remembering / bringing to the conscious mind / invoking the  
deity of Arunachala....   
Best wishes

thankyou for reminding that Arunachala is a mahamantra in itself.   
i liked the interpretation of A - Runa too.   
"DççÆivç: Mçí<çb $çÝCç: Mçí<çb Mç$çá: Mçí<çb lçLçÌJç ®ç~   
Hçávç: Hçávç: Hç´JçOç&ílç lçmcççlçd Mçí<çb vç kçÀçj³çílçd~~   
Agni (fire), Rna( runa-loan), shatru (enemy), if remain even in small   
trace (shesham) will grow again(punah punah pravardheta), so finish them   
completely (tatah shesham na karayet)".   
Let Arunchala burn all our runa-loan-karma which grows again and again with  
non-mindfullness.

Dear vinita,   
Excellent. Arunachala Siva is a Maha mantra. It has helped me   
and many others. And Bhagavan has said it. So, it should help   
you too. A Runa means the Effulgence which burns up all runa,   
debts (of birth, karma, and miseries due to adi bhoudika and adi daivika).   
Arunachala Siva.

Runam means disease also. Is not it.Inastrology they say, 6th place is  
pointing runam. In tamil they we have got 6 enemies. (AARU PAGAIVARGAL)   
but if we surrender to skanda who has got 6 faces, (Aaru Mugan) we can be  
saved. In many places, they mentioned Bhagavan is skanda,   
So He will wipe all the runam for those who surrender to Him and He would  
shower good gunam.

Runam means disease, debts and our dues [like our pitru   
karmas]. Skanda with six faces, will vanquish our six   
diseases or debts. He cleared the debts of devas, when   
Surapadma was ruling over them, and got them back the   
devaloka. Surapadma is the most diabolic rascal, against   
whom Hiraynakashyap, Ravana and Kamsa cannot even   
hold a candle! In his reign, devas went to get fish from   
oceans, Brahma had to stop all births, and Vishnu had   
to remain as a doorman! [Skanda Puranam].   
Arunachala Siva.
