Dear Senthivel,   
All books of Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi, are available in Sri   
Ramanasramam, Tiruvannamalai, 606 603. Some of Bhagavan   
Ramana's works are also available in audio. But the voice is   
not His.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear sankar, God is within, it is Sat-Chit-Ananda, according to   
Sankara. It is simply I-I for Bhagavan Ramana. Bhagavan has   
said that I-I is more potent than Om. Arunachala Siva.
