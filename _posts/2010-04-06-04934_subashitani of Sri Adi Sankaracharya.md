## TAT TVAM ASI subashitani of Sri Adi Sankaracharya

Sri Adi Sankaracharya's subashitani is a collection of some simple verses  
which reveal the Truth. Such verses are very useful aids for meditation. All  
one has to do, is pick the verse and see its meaning and be it!   
Quote  
mata nasti pita nasti nasti bandhu sahodarah   
artham nasti grham nasti, tasmat jagarat jagarata   
There is no mother, no father, no relative, no siblings.   
no money, no house, therefore remain awake!   
Please observe how Sankara uses such simple verses to reveal the Truth. When  
someone listens to such statements one might understand or may miss it  
altogether! If understood, one finds oneself released.   
Its like the story of a king who dressed himself like a beggar and then forgot  
his true nature. now, when someone goes to him and says "you do not have  
poverty, you do not have misery", that negation might seem foolish to him  
until he sees the Truth about himself.   
The common way people think is. .. they will know themselves by going into  
"Samadhi"... that is through meditation they will know themselves. And this is  
totally wrong. Meditation, Samadhi or even Self inquiry are not to know  
oneself. The beggar has to be told he is the king. And then he has to live it  
up. So the process of owning up his Kingdom involves meditation, samadhi etc.  
The meditation or samadhi are not for knowing that he is the king!   
he is the king, having known this... when one has to do "Nidhidhyasa", deep  
meditation... it means actually living it up. Scriptures state that one has to  
do sravanam... mananam and nidhidhyasam. Its like... the beggar should hear  
that he is the king. then he should understand that he is the king and then  
slowly start entering the kingdom, and owning up his kingdom! Samadhi,  
Meditaiton and inquiry are for owning up. not for knowing that he is the king!   
One has to know from a competent Guru and a competent Guru is one who has  
detachment, who has no other ulterior motives and who knows the scriptures in  
and out. only such a guru can help the disciple.   
so having known it, when the disciple wants to own up his True nature... these  
kind of statements are very useful aids.

Because people think that they will know their True nature through meditation,  
they try various techniques and are easily cheated into wrong means. As a  
result, these days, we have so many organizations which promise self  
realization through pranayama, mantra japa etc.   
There is really only one way... hear from a competent teacher and understand  
the import of the scriptures and then meditate on them or do self inquiry.  
that is the only way to find release. And a competent teacher must be an  
expert in scriptures. A competent teacher must have scriptural knowledge. Even  
Bhagavan Ramana did not know how to express himself until he heard scriptures  
like Ribhu Gita reveal the Self. only when he heard them did he understand  
that they were talking about what he is "Seeing"! so a teacher must be expert  
in scriptures. And also should have detachment! Only someone who saw the moon  
can reveal the moon to us! same way, only one who had the darshan of his Atman  
can reveal it! As such, such a teacher is nothing special. After knowing the  
Truth the teacher is given respect, but he is nothing special. Its just like  
any other subject. my teacher knows physics. he teaches it to me and  
thereafter, we are friends. we both know the truth and can teach it to others  
and we might have different methods of teaching. i need not keep worshiping  
the teacher's feet for my life time! same with this knowledge also.   
Now, when the verse says "you do not have a mother or a father"... it  
contradicts our normal experience. we have parents. no one is without parents!  
so the statement is contradicting the experience we have. This is because its  
talking from a different stand point. The a complete novice into spiritual  
tradition, this is a very strange statement. They do not "get" it. Coz they  
know they have parents. The statement seems like totally meaningless. Such  
people need to "question the teacher with devotion and a desire to know the  
Truth".   
Then, there are the so called "Spiritually Educated" and their plight is  
really worse. Coz they first need to know that they do not understand it! when  
they hear this statement. .. they will nod their heads "Yes! Yes!" and in  
truth, they did not understand. if we ask them, they reply "Coz I am not the  
body. I am Atma"! Now what is Atma ? why you are not the body? These are not  
properly understood. Atman is just a word for them and they too miss the  
point, but they do not even know that they have missed the point! This is  
really unfortunate.   
The ordinary person is atleast clear that the statement does not make sense to  
him. the so called spiritual person thinks that "He is Atman and he shall know  
that he is Atman by meditating!"!   
We will spend some time on understanding this "Knowing Atman through  
meditation" concept. Typically people who believe in this are people who think  
some "Experience" will make them know that they are Atman! Its very important  
to get out of this wrong notion.   
Love!

"you do not have a mother or a father"   
this is more of disowning the beggar nature. This disowning does not "Reveal"  
the Truth that we are king. As we know that we are the king, the disowning  
happens automatically.   
I have to understand my True Nature and then we will find out the Truth of  
this statement. Please see. Suppose there is a rose flower before me. how do i  
know it is there? I see it and therefore i know that it is there. the proof of  
the rose flower is in my seeing it. This is called Pratyaksha pramana. It is  
Pratyaksha, visible or perceivable and that is the proof.   
Suppose someone tells me that there is a rose flower in his bag. that is  
paroksha ! someone else told me, therefore i know about it.   
And then there is a third way of knowing. .. that is through inference. there  
is smoke, therefore there should be fire. inference.   
Now, the question is, how do i know about myself?   
Love!

The question is "How do i know about this Atma?"   
it cannot be through pratyaksha. .. For me to See myself, i should be already  
present!   
it cannot be paroksha, no one needs to tell me that i am.   
and it cannot be an inference.   
This means, No EXPERIENCE can Reveal me to MYSELF!   
Why? coz long before the Experience is there, I AM. All Experiences are  
dependent on my presence and they are limited in time and space.   
This is why some people run after "Experiences", they keep running. Coz, The  
Experiences are all transient. like a sense experience. The Sense experience  
gives us bliss. So we run after it. .. but being transient in nature, the  
experience loses its value very soon and we are left wanting for more. The  
same is the case with spiritual experiences. someone sees a God, say, and then  
he or she is in a very "spiritual mood", later the mood vanishes and one is  
left to face the world ! One cannot make the "spiritual mood" last for ever.   
And this is common problem we all face. I read Sri Ramakrishna. He says  
"Remain a celebate. Do not even look at the women". I am impressed. I try to  
remain. One day, two days or a week. .. and then the thought's novelity is  
lost. And just then my eyes fall upon a really beautiful woman... i lose. and  
then i blame myself for the slip.   
This wont help. This can happen with all philosophies.   
Experiences / Feelings. .. are not dependable and they cannot lead us to the  
Self.   
So lets get back to the question "How do i know myself, This Atma" ? We saw  
that all the known means to know the Self or Atma are futile. We have seen  
that pranayama, meditation, self inquiry cannot help us. they can give us some  
experiences at best. or they can purify the mind. but they cannot reveal the  
Self.   
So what is the way out? This is where our Scriptures come to our rescue. They  
say, the point is. .. we really do not need some technique to "Reveal The  
Self". Self is always Self Luminous. Self cannot be Revealed. But Self needs  
to be Recognized! Please see the difference here.   
Self being Self Luminous is shining now. God being Omnipresent, is here now.  
But the problem is we do not recognize it. We do not recognize God coz of  
various reasons. The beggar [in the story we talked about] need not become the  
king. The Beggar is already the king. he has to recognize that he is the king.  
He has to see for himself how he is the king.   
The reason why he thinks he is not the king is ignorance. and ignorance can  
only be removed by knowledge. not by meditation or inquiry. yes, not even by  
inquiry. Only by Knowledge. First Knowledge is required that he is the king  
and then he should start living like the king. That is where inquiry comes  
into picture. And inquiry is a powerful techinque. But since it is a karma...  
one has to "do something", it works only to purify the mind and lead it to  
samadhi stithi. it helps only for vasana skhaya [essentially loosening the  
grip of vasanas or inherent tendencies or habit patterns]. That is where self  
inquiry helps. Self knowledge has to be obtained from a competent guru.   
So Lets proceed to understand.   
Love!

In Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi Composition Of Sankaracharya's Atma Bodha  
(Knowledge of the Self ) also discusses that only by atma-gnanam can destroy  
ignorance.   
2\. **Of all the means to liberation, knowledge is the only direct one** Â as  
essential as fire to cooking; without it, liberation cannot be gained.   
3\. Not being opposed to ignorance, karma does not destroy it. **On the other  
hand, knowledge destroys ignorance as surely as light does darkness.**   
44\. True, the Self is always here and now; yet it is not apparent, owing to  
ignorance. **On ignorance being destroyed the Self seems as if it were gained,  
like the necklace on oneÂs own neck.**   
49\. In order to be liberated while yet alive, t **he sage should completely  
avoid the adjuncts** (upadhis), and thus gain the real nature of Being-  
Consciousness-Bliss, like the maggot that turns into a wasp.   
66\. Like gold freed from dross, the jiva (sadhaka) has all his impurities  
burnt away by the fire of knowledge bursting into flames fanned by **sravana,  
manana and nidhidhyasana** (hearing, reflection and contemplation) and now he  
shines forth by himself.

I agree with this statement   
 **44\. True, the Self is always here and now; yet it is not apparent, owing  
to ignorance. On ignorance being destroyed the Self seems as if it were  
gained, like the necklace on one 's own neck.**   
Yet i also agree with the meher quote saying a guru is needed, as the gurus  
prescense is necessary to remove that ignorance   
In this life my mind had very little dust, but it was not removed until i met  
& surrendered to the guru   
A lot of beings nowadays are saying 'i don't need anything to wake up' which  
is very true spoken from the Self, but not at all true spoken from the ego   
Its usually spoken out of the attempt to avoid surrendering to a living master

Dear srkudai,   
In the evening, I once again read your post. I agree that the   
Self is self luminous and no efforts which are per se dual, will   
help. But to say that we do not need EXPERIENCE is, in my   
view, not correct. God or Guru gives the experience out of his   
abundant grace. This experience may no doubt, be temporary,   
as it happened in the case of Mastan Swami, Chadwick and Devaraja   
Mudaliar but this little spoon of experience helps the true seeker   
to bestow more and more self attention or recognition (as you   
put it) or Sraddha, more and more interest with faith and conviction.   
Sri Sankara says my Guru said: Sivoham, Sivoham... But I do not   
yet become Siva. But I have faith in Guru's words and I shall   
pursue. This is sraddha towards experience.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Sri Arunachala Akshara Mana Maalai: Verse 44: How is it, O Arunachala! You told me, "Turn and   
look within and ever seek the Self with the inner eye and you   
will see it?"   
Verse 45: Seeking you with my weak mind, I have come back   
empty handed, aid me, O Arunachala!   
This is for the weak minded.   
The alternate meaning is: Verse 45: Seeking you in the infinite Self, I regained my own   
Self, O Arunachala!   
This is for the strong minded with Sraddha.   
The words dheeramil means without strong attention.   
The words theeramil means with strong attention that knows no   
 boundary.   
Since in Tamil, there is only one 'tha' which can also be pronounced   
as 'dha', the original verse gives room for 2 interpretations.   
Muruganar says that both the meanings should be contemplated.   
Then comes the beautiful verse about the Grace of God or Guru: Verse 47: O Lord Arunachala, let me, EVEN ME, merge in your   
true body, where only those of pure mind and speech merge.   
"Even me" indicates Guru's help and grace. Experience is essential,   
it may be for a short trice of time, but it helps to get the permanent   
abidance where there is nothing but Experience, the experience   
of Sat Chit Anandam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 Thank you for the elaborate post.   
Thats the reason why i requested you to comment. This is a point, discussing  
on which, we can be benefited.   
So when i say "Experience is not needed". What it means "SELF" is not "A  
Experience", it is the "Substratum of All Experiences".   
That means, "An Experience" is not "Spiritual Experience". .. "All Experiences  
are Spiritual" coz every experience has God or Self as the Substratum.   
Unfortunately, we have classified certain experiences as Spiritual and certain  
other experiences as unspiritual. And consequently, we miss the seemingly  
normal experiences which are really "Very Spiritual"! And certain others are  
there who seem to think seeing a bird Fly is spiritual but watching a movie or  
vehicle in the street is not! So they are able to find god in one experience  
and not in the other. that means they did not find god. they found experience.   
Every moment, Every Experience points to God/Self. Coz without Self no  
experience is possible! Every experience... be it the most materialistic  
experience. .. is spiritual.   
We do not need Experiences. .. coz there are so many experiences already! We  
do not need to see God as "A Particular Form", Coz God is already in the  
Silence which is every moment within and without us!   
The moment I identify God with a particular form. .. i miss God in the Silence  
All Around! I miss god in the normal man walking towards me in the morning ! I  
miss God in the Trees, the Birds, The Mountains, the Oceans, Sands. ..   
I miss God at all those places and "Seem to Search For him in Temples &  
Meditations"!   
And because we treat only seeing "Light" in meditation as really spiritual. ..  
When i see the clouds, the trees or the birds. .. or the motor vehicle on the  
busy road. .. its all a disturbance! We classified certain things as  
disturbances and certain others as "illuminating". .. coz of lack of  
Knowledge.   
The purpose of Knowledge is to "illuminate All Experiences" and that does not  
mean a particular experience will make us see all experiences as  
"illuminations". one can wait for such an experience for ever... but that is  
not going to happen. Coz, unfortunately, all experiences are "limited" in  
scope.   
you can find many people who have wonderful experiences and yet remain  
unillumined!   
When I was a kid, I knew a relative who saw God! And then when i saw her  
cursing a rickshaw puller ! I was astonished! Today I know why she misses God  
in Him?   
Its the same thing with all sense experiences. A sense experience is a glimpse  
of God! Coz where else can we get "Bliss" ? Deep Sleep is a glimpse of God!  
but one does not get illumined by them. Even as, someone may have experiences  
of Samadhi, and still remain unillumined! All knowledge is becoz of Samadhi.  
For example, if a great scientist discovers something new, its due to samadhi  
on the subject. Sa-vikalpa Samadhi. If i am able to experience bliss, its coz  
i drift into samadhi.   
just walking into an A/C room from outside. .. all thoughts vanish for a  
moment! And that is samadhi!   
unfortunately none of them illumine coz Samadhi is to be practiced AFTER  
knowing that I AM SELF... through sravanam and mananam. Only then will someone  
be able to see that the Samadhi is Sva-svarupa... irrespective of states of  
mind and body.   
Please comment   
Love!   
Silence

Yes, the Self is substratum of all experience, but Guru's   
grace is essential to get a glimpse of it so that one could   
pursue with sraddha. This experience is definitely not like   
an experience of eating an ice cream. It is beyond description.   
Chadwick came running from his cottage, with his wet towel,   
he was in the middle of a bath, and asked Bhagavan Ramana: "Bhagavan! Is it so simple?"   
Bhagavan said: Yes, it is.   
This is where, Chadwick who was a mature seeker,( I think he never   
went home back,) could get the experience that led him to the   
substratum, as you have put it.   
Abiding in the Substratum is the real experience.   
Na nirodha na chotpattir   
Nabaddho na cha sadhakaha   
Na mumukshur na vai mukta   
Ityesha paramarthata.   
 Gaudapada Karika, II.32.

Gaudapada arrived at Mars!

yes guru's grace is very much necessary and as ramana says power cannot be  
denied.   
Quote  
once KAVYAKANTHA Ganapathi Sastri, Kapali Sastri and his wife Parvathammal,  
enter the hall. They all bow before the Maharshi and take their seats. Many  
others are present.   
Kapali: When after a long struggle and development (by sadhana) one attains  
siddhi, is the attainment due to his effort or to the action of the Spirit or  
Power which is the object of his upasana?   
 **Maharshi: It is the action of the Current.**   
Kapali: So it is not the aspirant's actions that make him get siddhi, but it  
is the act of the Current?   
M: **Yes**.   
Kapali: Is it That which drew Bhagavan from Madurai to Tiruvannamalai?   
M: Yes. You see in the letter left at home at the time of leaving, I first  
wrote "By His command." And then added above it "In search of my Father." It  
is He that drew me. I wrote that and left. Also, finding funds was not due to  
my efforts. My brother of his own accord told me, "You had better take and pay  
my school fees at the school," and out of the five rupees given for that I  
took three rupees for the train to Tindivanam. Judging the distance from an  
out-of-date atlas of India, Tindivanam was the nearest railway station to  
Tiruvannamalai. Again, the train which usually leaves at 11.45 a.m. was  
unusually late. I left home after 12 noon for the station and was still there  
in time to catch it.   
The correct information about my destination was given to me by an old Muslim  
with a silvery white flowing beard, one or two stations after we left Madurai.  
"Where are you going swami?" he queried. "To Tiruvannamalai and so I have  
gotten a ticket to Tindivanam," I replied. "You are a strange passenger to go  
to Tindivanam in route to Tiruvannamalai. I am also going there," he said and  
added, "and we should change trains at Villupuram. You should not go to  
Tindivanam at all." He informed me that he was going to Tirukoilur, but  
strangely I did not find him when after some time I looked for him in the  
carriage. After that, I did not think of him at all.   
Kapali: That must have been Siva. Why call him a Muslim?   
[There was a pause in the conversation as Bhagavan remained silent.]   
 **Kapali** : Had the chastisement, "What work is there here for a person who  
is like this?" been uttered to Bhagavan before the day he left Madurai?   
 **Maharshi** : **Yes. But earlier it had produced no effect. On that day it  
was sufficient to make me leave home. The time had come for that.**

Once guru's grace is obtained then sravana, manana and nidhidhyasana should  
be practiced.

Dear Subramanian,   
Its not an experience but the knowledge that i am not this body but the  
Self... that liberates. And this knowledge if of mind alone!   
A particular experience may help one recognize this Self. Having heard about  
it some people may not gain sufficient conviction. So they benefit from the  
practice of Samadhi. After Practicing samadhi a few times one might gain  
enough conviction !   
Annamalai Swami had a wonderful experience when Ramana hugged him. But then,  
he still had to practice. There is no alternative.   
So as such its not the experience. .. but the conviction that is needed. That  
conviction can be gained if through a Guru's grace one has experience of  
Samadhi, after sufficient understanding of the Truth or that can be gained by  
nidhidhyasam.   
Love!   
Silence
