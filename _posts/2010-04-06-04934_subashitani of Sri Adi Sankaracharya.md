## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Ramana Maharshi's humorous comparision between relatives and disease

**20th January, 1946**   
When the personal attendants of Bhagavan were advised by doctors to give him  
food containing vitamins to relieve the pain in the legs they began doing so  
and were also massaging his legs with some special ointment. They were thus  
serving him to the best of their ability. **Bhagavan used to say humorously,  
A guest comes to your house. If you are indifferent towards him he will go  
away early, but if you show great respect towards him, and are very attentive  
he will never go. So is disease. If you attend to the disease in the manner  
you are doing now, why should it go? If you take no notice of it, it will  
disappear of its own accord.**   
Sometime ago, a young man set up an establishment about a mile from the  
Ashram, on the road round the hill,saying he would cure diseases by giving  
vibhuti. People get mad over such things, dont they? People who were  
diseased,possessed and the like started going in crowds to see that Vibhuti  
Swami, and on their way, they used to come to our Ashram also. What is there  
at this Ashram? No vibhuti! No magic lockets! They used to have darshan and  
then go away.On such occasions, if any attendants happened to be massaging his  
legs with medicated oil, Bhagavan used to say in a lighter vein, **Excellent,  
this is also good in a way. When these people see me thus, they would say,  
this Swami himself is suffering from pains in the legs and is getting  
massaged by others. What can he do for us? and go away without coming  
anywhere near me. So far so good.**   
 _Two or three years back when Bhagavan had jaundice,he could not relish his  
food and felt a great dislike for food.For about a week or ten days he ate  
only popcorns and the like. As Echamma and Mudaliar Patti have a vow that they  
will not eat until Bhagavan takes at least a morsel of food cooked by them he  
used to take a few grains from the rice brought by these ladies and mixing  
them with popcorn,used somehow swallow that food so that their vratam or  
deeksha might remain unimpaired._   
Months passed by; the jaundice persisted. A reputed doctor from Madras was  
called. The result was the same. After all had come and gone, and after all  
medicines had been tried without success, **he cured himself of jaundice in no  
time with sonti (dry ginger),pippalu (ipecac) and other Ayurvedic herbal  
medicines. Let any one venture to ask him how the disease was cured!**

Dear prasanth,   
Bhagavan Ramana's rheumatic pain was always acute. Whenever   
He gets up, He used to massage His legs with His hands and then   
only could stand and walk. Once someone came and there was   
some discussion. His stroll in the Hill was a little bit delayed.   
The attendant was ready with His walking stick and kamandalu,   
water pot. Bhagavan then told the devotee: See, "the monkey   
owner is ready with his stick. It is now time for the monkey   
to stand and dance, so I have to go!" He laughed and quickly   
massaged His legs and stood up for the afternoon stroll on the   
Hill!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear amiatall,   
What you say is correct. But we are not Bhagavan. So the pain and   
disease really bother us. But at the same time, one cannot be   
hypochondriac, taking a saridon the moment there is a mild headache.   
One should avoid this and take medicines only when the disease and   
pain become unmanageable. In T'malai, I had serious knee pain because walking  
back and forth inside the Asramam, climbing the stairs in dining hall and  
walking a long distance inside the temple.   
Knees are my weakest portions in my body. However, I decided not   
to take any Tiger Balm, which I had carried and managed to overcome the pain  
after the day's sleep.   
Arunachala Siva.

Excellent description Udai Shankar Garu.   
Once bhagavan ramana said,   
There is only one state, that of consciousness or awareness or existence. The  
three states of waking, dream and sleep cannot be real. They simply come and  
go.   
We may roughly put it like this.Existence or consciousness is the only  
reality. Consciousness plus waking, we call waking.Consciousness plus sleep,  
we call sleep. Consciousness plus dream, we call dream.   
**Consciousness is the screen on which all the pictures come and go. The  
screen is real, the pictures are mere shadows on it.**

Dear Prasanth,   
Suppose i see a sweet. and lets say doctor adviced me not to eat it!   
Tomorrow i go to the doctor and he says "your sugar levels are bad"   
I say: "Yes doctor, its all because of that bakery fellow"   
Doctor: "what did he do ?"   
I: He put a Sweet, with nice colors on it   
D: Then?   
I: The Sweet is the cause for these sugar levels   
D: Did the sweet pull you towards it and force you to eat it? or did the  
bakery person do it?   
I: Neither!   
D: Then ?   
I: Its this mind sir!   
D: Did the mind pull the sweet towards you?   
I: Mind gave me a thought.   
Doctor turns towards another person who was also there. .. and asks "Did not  
the thought come to u as well?"   
He replies "Yes"   
so now doctor asks: "He too has the thought, but he did not eat. who is the  
culprit?"   
I: Its me!   
Please see, my friend, mind is innocent. its a lifeless entity... jada  
padartha. its job is to give u ur stored memories. if it does not do that  
there is trouble.   
so if one has no mind. .. he becomes totally like a rock. its useless.   
one needs to know how to handle ones mind. .. and not get rid of it!   
Love!

yes, i agree control of the mind and senses are very much required.   
Afterall Bhagavad Gita deals with this in many verses.   
Dear Udai Garu and Other Members,   
I have one more doubt.   
In the below link thread you said   
http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/forum/index.php?topic=4824.msg13193#msg13193   
To have no Raga-Dvesha. Not possible.   
To not come under the Sway of Raga-Dvesha is Realization.   
Even a Realized person has Raga-Dvesha. No one can say eating neem leaves is  
the same as eating ice cream.   
I will agree with the above statement completly as even ramana liked to eat  
the iddlies and chilly powder he requested during the last month of his life.   
But lets take any animal for example pig.   
I wonder if pig has any Raga-Dvesha with regards to food.We all know that pig  
generally eats human waste as food and releases the same.   
Now if lets say idly is given to pig will it have more raga towards this food  
is my doubt?   
If no,then can we say animals are better than us with regards to control of  
tongue in this context?   
if yes,then no problems as we can univerally declare that no one can escape  
from Raga-Dvesha atleast in regards towards food.

One cannot escape Raga-Dvesha.   
Animals have Raga-Dvesha too. Perhaps they have more gross kind of Raga-  
Dvesha: they cannot differentiate subtlities. One of my uncles had a Dog. ..  
which loved Music!   
No one. .. however much one practices. .. can say neem leaves are tastier than  
ice cream. Even if Ramana is asked. .. he would not say such a thing.   
But Ramana would not come under the Sway of Raga-Dvesha. That is the way to  
liberation.   
A/C is comfortable than sitting in hot sun in summers. This much no one can  
say no!   
Love!

Dear srkudai,   
Nice posts, all that you wrote today.   
Many think that since Sivam or Guru is ekam or advaitam, it should   
not appear as something other than non-moving; only as Matter.   
No. It can appear to dance too! Om Rachitachala Tandavaya   
Namah: says Sri Ramana Ashottaram, the dance of achalam!   
How can achalam dance? Achalam's effulgence, gives an appearance   
that it is dazzling and dancing!   
Arunachala Siva.

So Atman is Consciousness.   
And mind, body etc are the different Koshas. Meaning Seaths.   
Having understood this...Its like playing roles in a drama. One can play roles  
without forgetting that one is not the role. That is the fun. To the Parents I  
am a Son or a Daughter. That is a role. With parents I play that Role. I do  
not say "I am Brahman". I play the role and respect the limitations of Role.  
To wife I am a husband. That is another Role. And These roles are all  
relative. Just Coz i am Brahman. .. i should not take away other person's  
house saying "We both are Brahman" !! In the Relative world, the differences  
will continue. In the Absolute world, differences are impossible.   
And its not even possible to drop all these roles. Coz that is dependent on  
Prarabdha Karma once one is Realized. Whether one should be a king like Janaka  
or a renunciate like Ramana or Suka. .. its determined by Prarabdha Karma of  
the body-mind equipment. The Self itself has no karma. Please note that even  
though Ramana left his house and lived in solitude. .. a whole Ashram got  
built around him! That's prarabdha!   
So one cannot run away from roles. And one should not take oneself to be the  
Roles. Knowing that the relative roles are just like the roles in a Drama  
played in the Presence of Consciousness which has absolutely no roles... one  
can just play with the different roles. But one should not forget that one is  
not the Role, but the one playing these Roles.   
Its like Someone playing the role of Ravana in a drama. .. suddenly forgets  
who he is and takes himself to be Ravana! One can easily imagine the trouble.  
But once he knows himself. .. he need not stop playing the role of Ravana. he  
can not only play the role of Ravana but also the Role of Rama if needed. Both  
are just works of art for him! That is fun! The relative limitations of the  
roles are not my limitations. The roles cannot be perfect. I cannot be  
imperfect! This is the point!   
Its like playing a foot ball match. There are artificial rules created. Those  
rules make the game interesting. So too... Having known that i am none of the  
roles i play... when i play the roles... the limitations of the roles are just  
fun! Coz without limitations it wont remain a game!   
Having understood this one can play various roles in this world. One can play  
the role of a son w.r.t to Father or Mother. One can play the role of a  
Husband or Wife. Or a Brother Sister etc. All roles are beautiful. They become  
a blessing once one knows that one is not the Role. One should know that one  
is Consciousness playing all these relative roles. Then its just Fun. If  
however i forget i am playing the role of a husband and take myself to be the  
husband! Then the whole trouble occurs.   
When Krishna says in BG that one should act without attachment, he just means  
this. One cannot avoid work or action. One has to play the relative roles he  
is involved in. There is no running away. The Knowledge that you do not have  
parents, wife etc is not to make one leave the wife and parents. That would be  
stupid. And more over, that just means one has picked up a new role: that of a  
wandering medicant! If " householder " is one relative role... "Monk" is yet  
another role. One cannot run away from the roles... coz this relative world is  
a Role. There is no way to run away from Roles. And one need not Run Away from  
these Relative roles.   
Love!   
Silence

So Remaining as Consciousness, one can play the relative roles of father  
mother, brother sister, spose, child etc. .. just as an artist plays the roles  
in a drama.   
Knowing fully well that one is Consciousness playing these Roles, one can play  
any role.   
These verses help one withdraw from the mind and mental roles. .. and seeing  
oneself as Consciousness, one can later pick up all the roles and play any  
number of them. Janaka ruled a whole kingdom. .. Sri Ramachandra was also a  
king! Who can claim to be more busy than Sri Krishna? And yet, nowhere do we  
see Krishna forgetting his True Nature. No where does Rama for get his True  
nature.   
Many so called scholars speak absolute nonsense when telling Ramayana. they  
say Rama does not know his true nature! That means he is like any of us! Rama  
was told the Truth by Vasishta himself. If that has not enlightened him. ..  
then Vasishta's teaching is incomplete! Please see. Rama was totally Realized.  
He knew himself. And yet when he lost his wife... he played the role of a  
husband.   
There were thoughts of sorrow. he could have chosen to ignore them or allow  
them. And he chose to allow them... consciously playing the Role of A husband.   
The whole of Ramayana is an illustration of how to live this up.   
The thoughts are required for us to play the roles. Memories are required to  
play roles. And fortunately thoughts are there, memories are there, names are  
there. But unfortunately we take these thoughts, names, memories to be  
ourselves. So when we know ourselves as Consciousenss. .. we clearly see that  
no thought can touch us, no memory can haunt us...When we see this. .. we see  
ourselves as free from the clutches of thoughts. now thoughts are there. .. we  
have the choice to go with them or not. Desires are luxuries. they cannot hold  
us! Rama was playing with the roles so beautifully!! And we shall learn to do  
so in what follows.   
Love!

If we have a car, we would like to go on a ride.   
We would not like to keep it always in parking.   
We would also like to learn to drive and then drive comfortably to where we  
want.   
if someone does not know how to drive he might enter the car hoping to drive  
it. .. but the car might drive him. .. and as a result he would end up  
somewhere else!   
Same with mind. one should "use" mind... one should not be "taken for a ride  
by mind" ! As it is with the mind, so it is with the roles like father,  
mother, brother etc... all roles are nice as long as one is playing the roles  
and one does not lose himself in the roles.   
One should know how to use the mind. unfortunately, when someone goes to a  
Bhajan session or Pranayama session. .. instead of learning to use the mind  
... one just learns to stop it for a few moments. Consequently the same person  
when he is out of the pranayama session, has to face life. .. he is in  
trouble.   
A wise man is one who knows himself and uses the mind rather than "Falling  
into the mind"

well said udai garu.   
Always guru ramana says we should be like an actor in a movie.   
Q: I am Awareness, then how to live it up?   
A: Like an actor who plays various roles but never forgets that he is the one  
playing these roles. one should never confuse oneself for the roles one plays  
in life.   
**\-- By Swami Suddhanandaji Of Samvit Sagar Trust**   
Just as an actor is not really affected by the passions which he displays on  
the stage, so also this Jnani, always aware of his perfection, is not affected  
by the seeming pleasures and pains which he regards as a mere illusion, like  
the horns of a hare. **\- TRIPURA RAHASYA**   
Give up hope, says the Vedanta. Why should you hope? You have everything, nay,  
you are everything. What are you hoping for? If a king goes mad, and runs  
about trying to find the king of his country, he will never find him, because  
he is the king himself. He may go through every village and city in his own  
country, seeking in every house, weeping and wailing, but he will never find  
him, because he is the king himself. It is better that we know we are God and  
give up this fool's search after Him; and knowing that we are God we become  
happy and contented. **Give up all these mad pursuits, and then play your part  
in the universe, as an actor on the stage.** **\- Swami Vivekananda**   
How should we act in the world? One should act in the world like an actor on  
the stage. In all actions there is in the background the real Self as the  
underlying principle; remember that and act. **\- Ramana Maharshi**

So does "Detachment" mean   
Leaving Family?   
Not having Feelings of Love for spouse ?   
Not having worrying about a relative's health ?   
Not worrying when your kid takes to bad habits?   
Not having ambitions for a better career ?   
Not having any desires?   
No! None of These!   
Detachment means not removing the "Feelings". .. but knowing that feelings  
cannot touch me. I as Consciousness am that in whose presence Feelings are  
possible. Knowing this, one has to recognize that feelings are the properties  
of the roles and have nothing to do with ME, Pure Consciousness.   
That is. .. The householder role has a family. If i leave the family and take  
up sanyas. i just take up another role in place of the householder role. That  
is not detachment.   
Its really to remain as householder and know that one is beyond all these  
relative roles that makes a person special.   
Lets take another example... the thoughts of sex for example. if they are not  
present, there is no way to involve in a sexual relationship. If they are  
present and they drive us crazy that is even worse. A saint is one who is the  
master of his thoughts.   
He is one who treats the thoughts as suggestions and not commands.   
that is he is not "Dragged" by thoughts.. . he uses them.   
That is detachment.   
Most people suggest not having a particular kind of thought. .. and say taht  
is detachment. Detachment in essence is to know that one is beyond all  
thoughts... one is Consciousness... and then no thought can drag... no thought  
is special... and being as such one can play any role with ease!   
So how do we start treating thoughts as suggestions and not commands? Lets  
explore this.   
Love!   
Silence

once a monk asked another monk what is the nature of thought   
the other monk gazed at him and said i thought so   
another monk joined them and said the universe is set up to record every

a fourth monk joined them and said dinner is ready

friend, brother, sister, stranger   
the hurt the happy the sick the healthy the dying the rude the polite the  
criminal the business man the beggar   
i consume them all they all enter me   
even the frog   
i see them all being consumed by my spirit   
the ones most hurt i actually see them hesitating sometimes but they also  
enter me   
nobody can deny pure love when it comes   
in the end i will consume even my body   
they burn in the fire of my love   
sometimes i see their faces on my spirit with an expression of amazement   
because of the love but they can always handle it because theres enough for  
everyone   
sometimes these faces in amazement they linger on for a bit, staying heck i  
dont know where, somewhere   
sometimes i whisper them something when i want to play with them   
in the end tho, even my spirit is a dream   
who ever said diving in the heart would be boring

## TAT TVAM ASI subashitani of Sri Adi Sankaracharya  
Author: srkudai             Date: April 06, 2010, 11:03:43 AM

Sri Adi Sankaracharya's subashitani is a collection of some simple verses  
which reveal the Truth. Such verses are very useful aids for meditation. All  
one has to do, is pick the verse and see its meaning and be it!   
Quote  
mata nasti pita nasti nasti bandhu sahodarah   
artham nasti grham nasti, tasmat jagarat jagarata   
There is no mother, no father, no relative, no siblings.   
no money, no house, therefore remain awake!   
Please observe how Sankara uses such simple verses to reveal the Truth. When  
someone listens to such statements one might understand or may miss it  
altogether! If understood, one finds oneself released.   
Its like the story of a king who dressed himself like a beggar and then forgot  
his true nature. now, when someone goes to him and says "you do not have  
poverty, you do not have misery", that negation might seem foolish to him  
until he sees the Truth about himself.   
The common way people think is. .. they will know themselves by going into  
"Samadhi"... that is through meditation they will know themselves. And this is  
totally wrong. Meditation, Samadhi or even Self inquiry are not to know  
oneself. The beggar has to be told he is the king. And then he has to live it  
up. So the process of owning up his Kingdom involves meditation, samadhi etc.  
The meditation or samadhi are not for knowing that he is the king!   
he is the king, having known this... when one has to do "Nidhidhyasa", deep  
meditation... it means actually living it up. Scriptures state that one has to  
do sravanam... mananam and nidhidhyasam. Its like... the beggar should hear  
that he is the king. then he should understand that he is the king and then  
slowly start entering the kingdom, and owning up his kingdom! Samadhi,  
Meditaiton and inquiry are for owning up. not for knowing that he is the king!   
One has to know from a competent Guru and a competent Guru is one who has  
detachment, who has no other ulterior motives and who knows the scriptures in  
and out. only such a guru can help the disciple.   
so having known it, when the disciple wants to own up his True nature... these  
kind of statements are very useful aids.

Because people think that they will know their True nature through meditation,  
they try various techniques and are easily cheated into wrong means. As a  
result, these days, we have so many organizations which promise self  
realization through pranayama, mantra japa etc.   
There is really only one way... hear from a competent teacher and understand  
the import of the scriptures and then meditate on them or do self inquiry.  
that is the only way to find release. And a competent teacher must be an  
expert in scriptures. A competent teacher must have scriptural knowledge. Even  
Bhagavan Ramana did not know how to express himself until he heard scriptures  
like Ribhu Gita reveal the Self. only when he heard them did he understand  
that they were talking about what he is "Seeing"! so a teacher must be expert  
in scriptures. And also should have detachment! Only someone who saw the moon  
can reveal the moon to us! same way, only one who had the darshan of his Atman  
can reveal it! As such, such a teacher is nothing special. After knowing the  
Truth the teacher is given respect, but he is nothing special. Its just like  
any other subject. my teacher knows physics. he teaches it to me and  
thereafter, we are friends. we both know the truth and can teach it to others  
and we might have different methods of teaching. i need not keep worshiping  
the teacher's feet for my life time! same with this knowledge also.   
Now, when the verse says "you do not have a mother or a father"... it  
contradicts our normal experience. we have parents. no one is without parents!  
so the statement is contradicting the experience we have. This is because its  
talking from a different stand point. The a complete novice into spiritual  
tradition, this is a very strange statement. They do not "get" it. Coz they  
know they have parents. The statement seems like totally meaningless. Such  
people need to "question the teacher with devotion and a desire to know the  
Truth".   
Then, there are the so called "Spiritually Educated" and their plight is  
really worse. Coz they first need to know that they do not understand it! when  
they hear this statement. .. they will nod their heads "Yes! Yes!" and in  
truth, they did not understand. if we ask them, they reply "Coz I am not the  
body. I am Atma"! Now what is Atma ? why you are not the body? These are not  
properly understood. Atman is just a word for them and they too miss the  
point, but they do not even know that they have missed the point! This is  
really unfortunate.   
The ordinary person is atleast clear that the statement does not make sense to  
him. the so called spiritual person thinks that "He is Atman and he shall know  
that he is Atman by meditating!"!   
We will spend some time on understanding this "Knowing Atman through  
meditation" concept. Typically people who believe in this are people who think  
some "Experience" will make them know that they are Atman! Its very important  
to get out of this wrong notion.   
Love!

"you do not have a mother or a father"   
this is more of disowning the beggar nature. This disowning does not "Reveal"  
the Truth that we are king. As we know that we are the king, the disowning  
happens automatically.   
I have to understand my True Nature and then we will find out the Truth of  
this statement. Please see. Suppose there is a rose flower before me. how do i  
know it is there? I see it and therefore i know that it is there. the proof of  
the rose flower is in my seeing it. This is called Pratyaksha pramana. It is  
Pratyaksha, visible or perceivable and that is the proof.   
Suppose someone tells me that there is a rose flower in his bag. that is  
paroksha ! someone else told me, therefore i know about it.   
And then there is a third way of knowing. .. that is through inference. there  
is smoke, therefore there should be fire. inference.   
Now, the question is, how do i know about myself?   
Love!

The question is "How do i know about this Atma?"   
it cannot be through pratyaksha. .. For me to See myself, i should be already  
present!   
it cannot be paroksha, no one needs to tell me that i am.   
and it cannot be an inference.   
This means, No EXPERIENCE can Reveal me to MYSELF!   
Why? coz long before the Experience is there, I AM. All Experiences are  
dependent on my presence and they are limited in time and space.   
This is why some people run after "Experiences", they keep running. Coz, The  
Experiences are all transient. like a sense experience. The Sense experience  
gives us bliss. So we run after it. .. but being transient in nature, the  
experience loses its value very soon and we are left wanting for more. The  
same is the case with spiritual experiences. someone sees a God, say, and then  
he or she is in a very "spiritual mood", later the mood vanishes and one is  
left to face the world ! One cannot make the "spiritual mood" last for ever.   
And this is common problem we all face. I read Sri Ramakrishna. He says  
"Remain a celebate. Do not even look at the women". I am impressed. I try to  
remain. One day, two days or a week. .. and then the thought's novelity is  
lost. And just then my eyes fall upon a really beautiful woman... i lose. and  
then i blame myself for the slip.   
This wont help. This can happen with all philosophies.   
Experiences / Feelings. .. are not dependable and they cannot lead us to the  
Self.   
So lets get back to the question "How do i know myself, This Atma" ? We saw  
that all the known means to know the Self or Atma are futile. We have seen  
that pranayama, meditation, self inquiry cannot help us. they can give us some  
experiences at best. or they can purify the mind. but they cannot reveal the  
Self.   
So what is the way out? This is where our Scriptures come to our rescue. They  
say, the point is. .. we really do not need some technique to "Reveal The  
Self". Self is always Self Luminous. Self cannot be Revealed. But Self needs  
to be Recognized! Please see the difference here.   
Self being Self Luminous is shining now. God being Omnipresent, is here now.  
But the problem is we do not recognize it. We do not recognize God coz of  
various reasons. The beggar [in the story we talked about] need not become the  
king. The Beggar is already the king. he has to recognize that he is the king.  
He has to see for himself how he is the king.   
The reason why he thinks he is not the king is ignorance. and ignorance can  
only be removed by knowledge. not by meditation or inquiry. yes, not even by  
inquiry. Only by Knowledge. First Knowledge is required that he is the king  
and then he should start living like the king. That is where inquiry comes  
into picture. And inquiry is a powerful techinque. But since it is a karma...  
one has to "do something", it works only to purify the mind and lead it to  
samadhi stithi. it helps only for vasana skhaya [essentially loosening the  
grip of vasanas or inherent tendencies or habit patterns]. That is where self  
inquiry helps. Self knowledge has to be obtained from a competent guru.   
So Lets proceed to understand.   
Love!   
Silence

In Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi Composition Of Sankaracharya's Atma Bodha  
(Knowledge of the Self ) also discusses that only by atma-gnanam can destroy  
ignorance.   
2\. **Of all the means to liberation, knowledge is the only direct one**  as  
essential as fire to cooking; without it, liberation cannot be gained.   
3\. Not being opposed to ignorance, karma does not destroy it. **On the other  
hand, knowledge destroys ignorance as surely as light does darkness.**   
44\. True, the Self is always here and now; yet it is not apparent, owing to  
ignorance. **On ignorance being destroyed the Self seems as if it were gained,  
like the necklace on ones own neck.**   
49\. In order to be liberated while yet alive, t **he sage should completely  
avoid the adjuncts** (upadhis), and thus gain the real nature of Being-  
Consciousness-Bliss, like the maggot that turns into a wasp.   
66\. Like gold freed from dross, the jiva (sadhaka) has all his impurities  
burnt away by the fire of knowledge bursting into flames fanned by **sravana,  
manana and nidhidhyasana** (hearing, reflection and contemplation) and now he  
shines forth by himself.

I agree with this statement   
 **44\. True, the Self is always here and now; yet it is not apparent, owing  
to ignorance. On ignorance being destroyed the Self seems as if it were  
gained, like the necklace on one 's own neck.**   
Yet i also agree with the meher quote saying a guru is needed, as the gurus  
prescense is necessary to remove that ignorance   
In this life my mind had very little dust, but it was not removed until i met  
& surrendered to the guru   
A lot of beings nowadays are saying 'i don't need anything to wake up' which  
is very true spoken from the Self, but not at all true spoken from the ego   
Its usually spoken out of the attempt to avoid surrendering to a living master

Dear srkudai,   
In the evening, I once again read your post. I agree that the   
Self is self luminous and no efforts which are per se dual, will   
help. But to say that we do not need EXPERIENCE is, in my   
view, not correct. God or Guru gives the experience out of his   
abundant grace. This experience may no doubt, be temporary,   
as it happened in the case of Mastan Swami, Chadwick and Devaraja   
Mudaliar but this little spoon of experience helps the true seeker   
to bestow more and more self attention or recognition (as you   
put it) or Sraddha, more and more interest with faith and conviction.   
Sri Sankara says my Guru said: Sivoham, Sivoham... But I do not   
yet become Siva. But I have faith in Guru's words and I shall   
pursue. This is sraddha towards experience.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Sri Arunachala Akshara Mana Maalai: Verse 44: How is it, O Arunachala! You told me, "Turn and   
look within and ever seek the Self with the inner eye and you   
will see it?"   
Verse 45: Seeking you with my weak mind, I have come back   
empty handed, aid me, O Arunachala!   
This is for the weak minded.   
The alternate meaning is: Verse 45: Seeking you in the infinite Self, I regained my own   
Self, O Arunachala!   
This is for the strong minded with Sraddha.   
The words dheeramil means without strong attention.   
The words theeramil means with strong attention that knows no   
 boundary.   
Since in Tamil, there is only one 'tha' which can also be pronounced   
as 'dha', the original verse gives room for 2 interpretations.   
Muruganar says that both the meanings should be contemplated.   
Then comes the beautiful verse about the Grace of God or Guru: Verse 47: O Lord Arunachala, let me, EVEN ME, merge in your   
true body, where only those of pure mind and speech merge.   
"Even me" indicates Guru's help and grace. Experience is essential,   
it may be for a short trice of time, but it helps to get the permanent   
abidance where there is nothing but Experience, the experience   
of Sat Chit Anandam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 Thank you for the elaborate post.   
Thats the reason why i requested you to comment. This is a point, discussing  
on which, we can be benefited.   
So when i say "Experience is not needed". What it means "SELF" is not "A  
Experience", it is the "Substratum of All Experiences".   
That means, "An Experience" is not "Spiritual Experience". .. "All Experiences  
are Spiritual" coz every experience has God or Self as the Substratum.   
Unfortunately, we have classified certain experiences as Spiritual and certain  
other experiences as unspiritual. And consequently, we miss the seemingly  
normal experiences which are really "Very Spiritual"! And certain others are  
there who seem to think seeing a bird Fly is spiritual but watching a movie or  
vehicle in the street is not! So they are able to find god in one experience  
and not in the other. that means they did not find god. they found experience.   
Every moment, Every Experience points to God/Self. Coz without Self no  
experience is possible! Every experience... be it the most materialistic  
experience. .. is spiritual.   
We do not need Experiences. .. coz there are so many experiences already! We  
do not need to see God as "A Particular Form", Coz God is already in the  
Silence which is every moment within and without us!   
The moment I identify God with a particular form. .. i miss God in the Silence  
All Around! I miss god in the normal man walking towards me in the morning ! I  
miss God in the Trees, the Birds, The Mountains, the Oceans, Sands. ..   
I miss God at all those places and "Seem to Search For him in Temples &  
Meditations"!   
And because we treat only seeing "Light" in meditation as really spiritual. ..  
When i see the clouds, the trees or the birds. .. or the motor vehicle on the  
busy road. .. its all a disturbance! We classified certain things as  
disturbances and certain others as "illuminating". .. coz of lack of  
Knowledge.   
The purpose of Knowledge is to "illuminate All Experiences" and that does not  
mean a particular experience will make us see all experiences as  
"illuminations". one can wait for such an experience for ever... but that is  
not going to happen. Coz, unfortunately, all experiences are "limited" in  
scope.   
you can find many people who have wonderful experiences and yet remain  
unillumined!   
When I was a kid, I knew a relative who saw God! And then when i saw her  
cursing a rickshaw puller ! I was astonished! Today I know why she misses God  
in Him?   
Its the same thing with all sense experiences. A sense experience is a glimpse  
of God! Coz where else can we get "Bliss" ? Deep Sleep is a glimpse of God!  
but one does not get illumined by them. Even as, someone may have experiences  
of Samadhi, and still remain unillumined! All knowledge is becoz of Samadhi.  
For example, if a great scientist discovers something new, its due to samadhi  
on the subject. Sa-vikalpa Samadhi. If i am able to experience bliss, its coz  
i drift into samadhi.   
just walking into an A/C room from outside. .. all thoughts vanish for a  
moment! And that is samadhi!   
unfortunately none of them illumine coz Samadhi is to be practiced AFTER  
knowing that I AM SELF... through sravanam and mananam. Only then will someone  
be able to see that the Samadhi is Sva-svarupa... irrespective of states of  
mind and body.   
Please comment   
Love!

Yes, the Self is substratum of all experience, but Guru's   
grace is essential to get a glimpse of it so that one could   
pursue with sraddha. This experience is definitely not like   
an experience of eating an ice cream. It is beyond description.   
Chadwick came running from his cottage, with his wet towel,   
he was in the middle of a bath, and asked Bhagavan Ramana: "Bhagavan! Is it so simple?"   
Bhagavan said: Yes, it is.   
This is where, Chadwick who was a mature seeker,( I think he never   
went home back,) could get the experience that led him to the   
substratum, as you have put it.   
Abiding in the Substratum is the real experience.

Nabaddho na cha sadhakaha

yes guru's grace is very much necessary and as ramana says power cannot be  
denied.   
Quote  
once KAVYAKANTHA Ganapathi Sastri, Kapali Sastri and his wife Parvathammal,  
enter the hall. They all bow before the Maharshi and take their seats. Many  
others are present.   
Kapali: When after a long struggle and development (by sadhana) one attains  
siddhi, is the attainment due to his effort or to the action of the Spirit or  
Power which is the object of his upasana?   
 **Maharshi: It is the action of the Current.**   
Kapali: So it is not the aspirant's actions that make him get siddhi, but it  
is the act of the Current?   
M: **Yes**.   
Kapali: Is it That which drew Bhagavan from Madurai to Tiruvannamalai?   
M: Yes. You see in the letter left at home at the time of leaving, I first  
wrote "By His command." And then added above it "In search of my Father." It  
is He that drew me. I wrote that and left. Also, finding funds was not due to  
my efforts. My brother of his own accord told me, "You had better take and pay  
my school fees at the school," and out of the five rupees given for that I  
took three rupees for the train to Tindivanam. Judging the distance from an  
out-of-date atlas of India, Tindivanam was the nearest railway station to  
Tiruvannamalai. Again, the train which usually leaves at 11.45 a.m. was  
unusually late. I left home after 12 noon for the station and was still there  
in time to catch it.   
The correct information about my destination was given to me by an old Muslim  
with a silvery white flowing beard, one or two stations after we left Madurai.  
"Where are you going swami?" he queried. "To Tiruvannamalai and so I have  
gotten a ticket to Tindivanam," I replied. "You are a strange passenger to go  
to Tindivanam in route to Tiruvannamalai. I am also going there," he said and  
added, "and we should change trains at Villupuram. You should not go to  
Tindivanam at all." He informed me that he was going to Tirukoilur, but  
strangely I did not find him when after some time I looked for him in the  
carriage. After that, I did not think of him at all.   
Kapali: That must have been Siva. Why call him a Muslim?   
[There was a pause in the conversation as Bhagavan remained silent.]   
 **Kapali** : Had the chastisement, "What work is there here for a person who  
is like this?" been uttered to Bhagavan before the day he left Madurai?   
 **Maharshi** : **Yes. But earlier it had produced no effect. On that day it  
was sufficient to make me leave home. The time had come for that.**   
 **Source** : http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/2008/?pg=may-jun#article.2  
Once guru's grace is obtained then sravana, manana and nidhidhyasana should  
be practiced.

Dear Subramanian,   
Its not an experience but the knowledge that i am not this body but the  
Self... that liberates. And this knowledge if of mind alone!   
A particular experience may help one recognize this Self. Having heard about  
it some people may not gain sufficient conviction. So they benefit from the  
practice of Samadhi. After Practicing samadhi a few times one might gain  
enough conviction !   
Annamalai Swami had a wonderful experience when Ramana hugged him. But then,  
he still had to practice. There is no alternative.   
So as such its not the experience. .. but the conviction that is needed. That  
conviction can be gained if through a Guru's grace one has experience of  
Samadhi, after sufficient understanding of the Truth or that can be gained by  
nidhidhyasam.   
Love!
