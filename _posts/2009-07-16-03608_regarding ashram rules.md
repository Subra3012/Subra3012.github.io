## regarding ashram rules

I have not visited ashram yet. I'm visiting during second week of August'09  
for the first time and obtained email approval also for my stay. I just want  
to be there and do girivalam and visit places/caves that Bhagavan visited and  
the temple.   
Are there any rules for time in and time out every day? i would like to do  
girivalam in the early hours around 03:00AM or 04:00AM. Will there be people  
to help us to take us up the hill or show places in the hill like virupakshi  
cave or mamara cave?   
with love   
Balasaraskrishna

Dear saraskrishna,   
I have given many details on the queries of various devotees at   
different points of time, and these can be seen by you under the   
topics heads: Arunachala, Ashram etc., Regarding your specific   
queries: 1\. Bhagavan Ramana stayed in Virupaksha Cave and also in   
Mamarathu Guhai, Mango Tree Cave. These are at different   
altitudes on the Hill. You can reach these caves, by taking general   
guidance from the Asramam people. Do not take "guides" who   
may lynch you. Other places are in the foot hills or in town. Skandasramam  
is also on the Hill. Skandasramam and Virupaksha   
Cave can be covered as the second is on the way to the first.   
2\. Giri valam on Full Moon Days can be covered right from 2 am   
because there will be a lot of crowd. Other days, you may perhaps   
start around 4 am. Please go by the main tar road route. Other   
routes are more difficult to negotiate.   
Arunachala Siva.
