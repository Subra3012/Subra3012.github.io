Dear karthikeyan. M,   
Kamba Ramayanam was composed by Poet Kambar, around 10th   
century AD. It is broadly based on Srimad Valmiki Ramayanam.   
The story is the same but certain Tamil principles like high chastity   
of women, treating close friends as brothers are highlighted. Sita   
is extolled as the personification of chastity. When Hanuman comes   
back from Lanka, he tells Rama: "I saw Sita and from her eyes I   
understood her matchless chastity." Rama takes Guha as his   
fifth brother, Hanuman as his sixth brother and Vibhishana as his   
seventh brother. Rama is shown with some of the divine qualities,   
whereas Valmiki treated him only as a righteous human being.   
Arunachala Siva.
