Can anyone say where the closest international airport is to the ashram?   
From the airport are there rail links?   
I'd rather use the train than taxi.   
And it'll be a lotta fun finding the right train lol

Opps sorry, I should have read more threads before posting. Chennai  
International Airport would be best.

Dear kde,   
Chennai International airport is the best. Though Bangalore   
International airport is also of the same distance from T'malai.   
But from Chennai airport one gets almost daily share taxis or   
single taxi, to take you to T'malai ashram in 5 hours. If you   
travel singly, you may have to pay Rs 1000/- (200 kms). If   
you keep the same taxi for return on next day, it might work   
less than the double. Train journey is okay but a little longish.   
You have to get down at Tindivanam and change train. I am also   
told that T'malai Railway station is dysfunctional for some time,   
since they are making the rails as broad gauge from metre gauge.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks Subramanian.R,   
I'm a long way off yet, but just trying to get an idea. I will try to visit in  
December.   
The taxi sounds like the best idea and not expensive, exchange rates for you.  
I hope the driver is friendly cuz thats a long drive. I used to be a taxi  
driver so we can talk about that.

Dear Subramanian R   
You are well out of date with your information. The taxi fare from Chennai is  
about Rs.2100 one way (with A/C) and it takes 3.5 hours by road in modern  
cars.

Thanks Graham, that still seems like a more than fair price.
