Let us go for a Tirtha Yatra (pilgrimage). .. virtually.   
Let us go for a Girivalam around the Arunachala Hill.   
I have shared some pictures of Girivalam which I did a few years back.   
http://www.greenmsg.110mb.com/topic/spirituality/yatra/toc/yatra_toc.php   
Hope you enjoy the Yatra as you go through the pictures.   
Om Shanti.

## Swami Vivekananda and freemasonry  
Author: Japo                Date: March 27, 2010, 02:49:57 PM  
---  
I've been reading Swami Vivekananda's teaching and information about his life  
and I found out he was freemason. Altough I know little about freemasonry,  
this disturbs me a little because I've heard that satan worship, demonic  
rituals and other dark stuff is part of it. So what do you think about this  
and is my stereotypical view about freemansory totally wrong. And were any  
other famous advaita teachers freemasons.   
thanks

Forum rules -   
Any guru mentioned on this forum MUST have been dead for at least 50 years.   
Please abide by the rules of the forum or you will be excluded from using it.   
Nisargadatta (April 17, 1897  September 8, 1981)   
He has not been dead for fifty years, if I am not wrong.   
I think this forum rule is to avoid futile arguments on guru.   
I wonder why some of forum members keep breaking this rule.   
Recently on this forum, some of members keep replying to me with mention of  
Nisargadatt.   
I am fed up.   
I do not mind that some members have faith in Nisargadatta.   
I hope they do not mind that I think Nisargadatta is a fake.   
Orginally I did not want to say this, as I do not want to hurt other members'  
feeling.   
I say this because they seem to be persistent.   
What we have in common here is faith in Bhagavan Ramana.   
Please do not push other members to believe in other gurus.

## Tolerance  
Author: Graham              Date: July 02, 2007, 10:20:52 AM  
---  
The purpose of this forum is to permit people to post their questions, answers  
and observations for other members to respond to.   
Faith is an emotive issue and has many facets. No-one has any right to condemn  
other people just because they disagree with them.   
You cannot report topics to the administrator just because you don't like  
them. If you are offended by something then you have the freedom to post your  
own message.   
Everyone wants their voice to be heard, this is a fact of life, but tolerance  
is very important. However, generally offensive material, obvious lies and  
racial comments will be removed without hesitation.   
In January and February of 2007 links to pornographic sites were placed on  
this forum. This is the kind of thing that should be reported immediately.
