## Forum upgrade  
Author: Graham              Date: June 23, 2011, 07:13:25 AM

This morning the forum was upgraded to the latest version.   
Some things may appear to work differently - please go through the new  
features.   
Any theme preferences you selected previously have been removed and the old  
themes which no longer work have been deleted.   
I will be adding new themes and configuring the new installation shortly

## Changing the forum layout/colour scheme (Theme) to suit YOU  
Author: Graham              Date: June 24, 2011, 12:07:38 PM  
---  
If you don't like the default theme for the forum (colours, layout, etc.) you  
can always change it for another theme.   
To accomplish this - after login select 'Profile' from the menu above or to  
the left, then under 'Modify Profile' select 'Look and Layout'.   
The first item in the list is ' **Current Theme:** ' followed by a name and  
(Change) inside brackets. Click on 'change' and then scroll down the list of  
installed themes. You have two choices: [Use this theme]   
[Preview theme]   
Preview the theme first as not all will work the same in every browser. When  
you are happy select 'Use this Theme'   
If you prefer a menu to the left rather than the default horizontal menu,  
simply click on the the '<<' double arrows to the right of the top menu.   
The default theme is called **Headline** and this has been modified for anyone  
to use.   
The **Grasslands** theme has now been modified

Friends,   
while viewing the tamil fonts in default size that is 10, "கின்ற சாலையிடை வே"  
in the space between words there is [] kind of rectangle mark, are others as  
well facing the same problem? But i noticed when I increase the font size to  
11, then it is fine. it would be nice if this can be sorted out. Thank you.

## Ribhu Gitai Tamil Mp3s  
Author: ammaskartik         Date: July 28, 2011, 04:47:09 AM

Namah Shivaya,   
I found a very good quality chanting of the Ribhu gita in tamil on  
http://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/ribhugita.html, which I am sure all of you  
brothers and sisters are familar with. Is this the chanting of the original  
Tamil rendering by Sri Ulaganatha Swami that Ramana Maharshi used to talk so  
highly about?   
Namah Shivaya, Kartik

did they publish all chapters in that web link? Is it Chorus or sinlge  
singing?   
Chorus singing will be very very soothing.   
Generally they chant in chorus Ribu Gita around 2:30 PM near Mother temple.  
All chapters will be read in rotation. The tone and music is simpy awesome.   
I requested Ashram to record their singing of all chapters and publish a CD.

Namah Shivaya,   
It is very good quality and soothing.   
So, then to followup on my original question: Is this the chanting of the original Tamil rendering by Sri Ulaganatha Swami  
that Ramana Maharshi used to talk so highly about?   
Namah Shivaya, Kartik

Dear ammaskartik,   
There are two versions available in Sri Ramanasramam: 1\. Tamizh verse version done by Ulaganatha Swamigal [who has also   
done Vivekachoodamani in Tamizh verses] which Sri Bhagavan   
recommended to everyone. An English free verse translation of this   
is done by Dr. H. Ramamoorthy and Mr. Nome of this.   
2\. There is a Sanskrit version with English meanings in prose by   
Dr. Lingeswara Rao.   
3\. Both are not identical.   
4\. All the three books are available in Sri Ramanasramam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Namah shivaya,   
Thanks for your thoughtful reply. I didnt mean the books, sorry forthe  
confusion. There is a tamil rendering of the gita that you can download from  
the ashram site, with the link i provided above, and i was wondering if the  
audio chanting was of the original tamil version which ramana maharshi used to  
recomend.   
Namah shivaya, kartik

Dear friend,   
Yes. Audio chanting in Tamizh is the original Tamizh version i.e   
the book of Ulaganatha Swamigal.   
Arunachala Siva.
