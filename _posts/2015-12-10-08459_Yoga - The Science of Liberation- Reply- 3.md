The various stages of Samadhi, described in the Yoga Sutras, are as follows: First, Patanjali makes a   
distinction of it as one of Samprajna and Asamprajna, the former having an  
objective prop, and the   
latter being devoid any such prop, the intermediate stages being like this: There is first, the   
Savitarka, based on deliberation on gross objects, where in the yogi's  
attention is conveyed to a   
single object with the exclusion of all others, which is not so much as  
objective concentration, but is   
one of seeing the essential ingredient of thought. The deliberative stage  
leads to the non-deliberate   
stage, wherein there is no censor, but only impressions. This is a stage of  
void, 'a cloud of unknowing',   
as it were rendering the censor immobile, a transition from the Samprajna to  
the Asamprajna. From   
this void the yogi proceeds to see the Universe in its essential form of the  
Tanmatras, (meaning suchness   
of things) a state of idealism of things the descent of which is the gross  
world. This is known as   
Savichara Samadhi, involving analysis, the observer-observed dichotomy still  
being there in a subtle   
form, the objects involved being the subtle essence of the gross world.
