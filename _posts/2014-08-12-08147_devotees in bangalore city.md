I'm wondering if there are any devotees in the Seattle metro area and if there  
is a monthly sathsang that i can join.

This is to inform that we have created a Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi Satsang  
in Nova Friburgo RJ Brasil. We use material that we have received in 2007 from  
Ramanasraman. Our e-mail is mahabhutani@yahoo.com.br   
NamastÃª!
