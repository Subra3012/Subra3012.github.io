**PAAHI RAMAA RAMANA**   
Protect me, Rama! If one gives up meditating on you, even a grain   
of your grace will not be available to him. How long am I to suffer   
and how long to bear it? A jasmine flower on the hand cannot   
withstand a stone. A cucumber fruit cannot bear an iron belt.   
Could a poor parrot be assailed with a Brahmaastra? If parents   
abandon a son, what other way is open to him? Can butter stand   
a sword-blow? Oh Rama, my refuge!   
Nagaraj

**SAADHANA SAMPAT**   
Oh my mind! Tell me truly, which conduces greatly to happiness -   
wealth or the sight of the Lord? Which is more delicious -   
milk, butter and curd or the nectar of the worship and contemplation   
of Sri Rama?   
Which is happier - the control of the senses and forbearance which   
are comparable to a bath in the Ganges or the bath in the well with   
the mire of low sense enjoyments?   
Which gives more happiness - flattery of mere men bound up in their   
own conceit or the singing of the Lord who has been praised by the   
wise Tyaagaraaja?

**RUKALU PADIVELU**   
Though you may have tens of thousands of rupees,   
what you actually need is only a handful of rice.   
Though you may have immense quantity of clothes,   
you need only one for wearing.   
Though you may possess extensive territory, for laying   
your body at rest, you require only three cubits of space.   
Though you may have hundreds of varieties of cakes,   
you can take only as much as your mouth can hold.   
Though the lake may be full of water, you can draw   
therefrom only as much as your vessel can hold.   
Oh Mind! (In the pursuit after these) forget not   
Hari, the essence of the Universe.   
Nagaraj

**VINAVE OMANASA**   
Oh Mind! Listen to my appeal. I am making it clear to you.   
Do not knowingly indulge in bad ways and get ruined.   
These ways will not serve you. They won't bring you the   
Lord's grace. Do Dhyaana and Bhajana
