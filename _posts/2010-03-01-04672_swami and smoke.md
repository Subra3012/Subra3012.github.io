Cat sits in meditative pose for hours.   
Then when somebody silently enters the kitchen, one of their ears get turned  
towards that side; with the slightest sound of opening of the lid of the milk  
bowl, half of their eyes get opened and when the milk bowl is brought at the  
dining table, the cat is right before you.   
Hasn't they balanced the ethereal with the physical?

I have observed that cats do not have gratitude for the help given by   
human beings. Unlike dogs, they ditch you, if you do not give milk   
for two continuous days. They do not have the sense of scent which   
dogs do have. With your body scent, dogs will find you, the Master.   
Cats do not have this but their sense of alertness is equally great.   
No cats came to Bhagavan Ramana for any food assistance or protection.   
But dogs, monkeys, peacocks came.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear SLakshmi,   
Yes. In the same way, I think, when a large volume of incense was   
burnt or when arti was shown, Bhagavan Ramana said: "Okay. Show   
these to to your heart's content. But why not to that Kallu Swami (the   
stone image, in front of Mother's Temple? It will not object." This   
was in 1946. It happened. Today we have only the Kallu Swami but   
not Bhagavan Ramana in body. His living Presence is however definitely   
there. The Asramam has seen to it that no arti is shown or no incense   
is burnt even before that stone image!   
Arunachala Siva.

Doopam normally refers to a small wick dipped in ghee and shown   
to God in the home altar before actual camphor lighting.   
Deepam is a regular lamp, with oil or ghee.   
Dasangam is the one which is called Sambrani, the powder which   
is burnt on a coal fire.   
The words, Dasangam and Doopam are of course interchangeably used.   
Arunachala Siva.
