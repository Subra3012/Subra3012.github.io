## Shortest road to Self Realisation

No way is short or long, but some people are more in earnest and some are  
less. I can tell you about myself. I was a simple man, but I trusted my Guru.  
What he told me to do, I did. He told me to concentrate on 'I am' \-- I did.  
He told me that I am beyond all perceivables and conceivables -- I believed. I  
gave him my heart and soul, my entire attention and the whole of my spare time  
(I had to work to keep my family alive). As a result of faith and earnest  
application, I realised my self (swarupa) within three years.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Everyway, whether it is short or long, needs a conviction and   
steadfast faith in Guru's words. Many devotees used to ask   
Bhagavan Ramana whether they could take up surrender instead   
of self enquiry, presuming that the former was easy. Bhagavan   
Ramana smiled and told them: "Do not think surrender is easy,   
it is as difficult as self enquiry." Both the ways need conviction   
and faith in Guru's teachings and guidance.   
Arunachala Siva.
