Mano nasa......   
If we have no manam (mind) suddenly, can we live in the present society. For  
day to day life is not necessary to have mind......Especially if you have a  
family and kids who do not have spiritual incliantion. comments please   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 Manonasa does not mean destruction of mind in the literal sense.Mind is a very valuable tool available to us because it is a reflecting medium of Pure conscious being.This reflected light is useful to see the things in the phenomenal reality.Manonasa means destruction of   
snakalpa and vikalpa dosha.Rest of the mind functions normally even after  
manonasa.Bhagawan gave excellent guidance to humanity through   
his teaching on self-enquiry only after manonasa.In manonasa unwanted doshas  
of mind are destroyed,rest are preserved as before.   
You will attend to your family and kids more sanely after you attain  
manonasa.So dont be afraid of manonasa,kindly long for it.

Dear Ramanaduli, What Raju says is correct. Sri Sadhu Om   
says two things about mano nasa.   
1\. As Raju says, killing only the sankalpa and vikalpa dhosha. It   
is like roasting the gold in fire, to remove the impurities.   
2\. The other is destruction of the mind. Here again, even after   
the destruction of the mind, the mind remains as Pure Mind or   
Suddha Manas. This Suddha Manas does all the worldy work.   
It is the Pure Mind with which Sankara and Bhagavan composed   
all the poems and other works!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Its like a person playing role in a Drama. The person unfortunately is getting  
identified with the character he is playing.   
Naturally he cannot enjoy the roles he is playing. He cannot stop playing.   
I was studying Sri Ramana's commentry on Vivekachudamani its beautiful.  
Ramana explains: Abide as the Self.   
Please see. .. The rememberance that i am the Self playing this role of a  
"Software Engineer", with a "wife", with parents and a brother of someone etc  
... this is the role. .. and i am the consciousness in whose presence the role  
is happening. Thus seeing that the body is a grab that is picked up for the  
role... i do not have a body.   
The rememberance is very important. When we forget this that is when the  
problem is.   
For the one who has no conviction. .. who does not see himself as  
consciousness unaffected by the happenings: who thinks he is getting affected  
by the happenings, it is important to see the mind and how we ourselves are  
getting into the thoughts and thoughts cannot touch us without our wrong  
identification. This leads to conviction that i am the Self and that leads to  
firm Abidence in it.   
Japa, Prayer, Meditation are useful. .. but a person can go on doing it life  
long without understanding that he is the Self. .. and such a person will not  
find liberation... unless he learns that he is the Self.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear everyone,   
Japa, prayer and meditation are all aids to self enquiry, because   
these bring about one thought of the Godhead, instead of many   
thoughts which slowly weaken but spread more and more. This   
is as per Who am I?. Ekakrita is obtained through such activities,   
and it helps to do self enquiry. To say that japa, prayer and meditation   
are not required is like doing pole vault without the pole!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Please do not worry. Not much water has flown since your last   
operation. You have come back from US, and you have to get   
re-acclimatize to the Indian diaspora. There are powercuts,   
there are voltage fluctuations, and there are breakdowns which   
are not set right for days and weeks.   
Arunachala Siva.
