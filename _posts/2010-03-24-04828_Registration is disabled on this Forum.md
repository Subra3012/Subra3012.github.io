## Sri Rama Navami 2010  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 24, 2010, 07:26:34 AM

Today, Chandramana Chaitra Sukla Paksha Navami, is Sri Rama's birthday. No  
one knows   
Rama's birthday correctly. But his star was Punarvasu and his birth digit  
(moon's digit)   
was Navami.   
Sri Rama is known for his abundant compassion. Siva, Rama and Bhagavan Ramana   
were embodiments of compassion. They took people as they surrendered, as  
their own.   
No holds barred. Sri Rama, while coming back from Lanka in pushpaga vimana  
showed   
the Rameswaram Ramanatha Linga to Sita and said: Here is where Siva, Mahadeva   
showed his abundant grace towards me and I could build a bridge to cross over  
to Lanka.   
He is the Prabhu whom I adore. (Valmiki Ramayana). Whatever was attributed  
to   
Siva by Rama, that abundant grace and compassion were also his own qualities.  
He   
took Guha, Sugriva, Hanuman and Vibhishana regardless of their merits because  
they   
all surrendered to him.   
Bhagavan Ramana also did the same thing to His devotees. He never bothered  
about   
their preliminary qualifications. He took them as they were and poured His  
Grace.   
In Sri Vishnu Sahasranamam, Siva says to Parvati that Rama is the one in whom  
I   
find great love.   
B.V. Narasimha Swami in his Self Realization, has compared Rama with Ramana.   
Arunachala Siva.

Due to a vast increase in the number of spammers - more than 92 banned this  
month alone, with dozens of IP's denied access to all of my sites, I have  
decided to suspend membership for the foreseeable future.   
Anyone who is genuinely interested in Bhagavan and wants to join, should email  
me and I will register them.

Dear Sri Graham,   
This is inevitable. I think its a very good decision or initiative. Its a call  
of the times.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana
