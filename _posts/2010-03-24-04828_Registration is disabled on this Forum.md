Due to a vast increase in the number of spammers - more than 92 banned this  
month alone, with dozens of IP's denied access to all of my sites, I have  
decided to suspend membership for the foreseeable future.   
Anyone who is genuinely interested in Bhagavan and wants to join, should email  
me and I will register them.

Dear Sri Graham,   
This is inevitable. I think its a very good decision or initiative. Its a call  
of the times.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana
