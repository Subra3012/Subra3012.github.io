Dear karthikeyan. M and everyone,   
Kindly see the new inclusion of Bhagavan Ramana's score   
of photographs either through slow slide or fast slide   
as furnished by Graham Boyd in the face page link.   
Graham Boyd has also re-designed the face page. Kindly   
see them in leisure. There is one photograph with Bhagavan   
having a silk or woolen shawl [which He put on when they   
all went to Skandasramam around 1945] on His head.   
Suri Nagamma has written about this. In this photograph   
Bhagavan Ramana looks like His Mother Azhagamma.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Aham Brahmasmi,   
It is the same as the Forum link. As you open Forum,   
you will find the face page, where there is Bhagavan   
Ramana's photograph and there is short biography about   
Him. Here you may, on the right, find a small photograph   
of Bhagavan Ramana, with a legend, 117 Restored Photographs   
of Bhagavan Ramana. Click here, and it will show the photos   
either in fast slide or in slow slide, as you wish. You can   
see them leisurely under slow slide. You do not need any   
Adobe or Winbrowser or pdf mechanism. Each small photograph   
can also be enlarged by clicking on the particular photo.   
Please try and let me know.   
Arunachala Siva.

I looked on them form time to time, pure meditation... when my energy is not  
moving freely and I look at this pictures I start to cry and all is in harmony  
again..

Dear matthias,   
I am quite happy to read your post. Arunachala/Bhagavan   
Ramana, these pictures do have a magnetic appeal. They   
make one cry or dance in joy or cause heaving. These are   
are all, as you say, to move one's energy. Saint Manikkavachagar has sung: "Can I not get you by weeping   
before you?"   
Arunachala Siva.
