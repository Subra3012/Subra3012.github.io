## Where is Ramana, where is Ramana?

Once a visitor (who was coming for the first time) suddenly entered   
the kitchen and asked: Where is Ramana? Where is Ramana?   
Bhagavan was alone in the kitchen. The visitor did not know Him.   
Bhagavan Ramana then showed him a big brass vessel used for   
making sambhar, where the word Ramana has been engraved, and   
said: Here is Ramana. The visitor got confused and came out   
in desperation. The devotee who was there said: The man inside   
who is preparing some item in the kitchen is Ramana. Both then   
went inside and asked Bhagavan Ramana why He had showed the   
vessel. Bhagavan replied: "Here is where the name is written.   
Where is Ramana written on me?"   
Salutations to Him, who is beyond name and form.   
Arunachala Siva.

What is the difference in between Humour and funny. Any way both raises from  
the mind? Is it not?   
I think, there must be learning and inner meaning in jnani's humour whereas  
ajnani's humour would creat some unpleasant situations.

Bhagavan Ramana's humour was quite subtle, invariably. His   
humour was not hurting anyone but at the same time making a   
point for correction.   
Once, too many incense sticks and dasangam were lighted in the   
Old Hall. As people who have gone to the Asramam noticed, the   
Old Hall is quite small and apart from Bhagavan's sofa, where He   
was always sitting or reclining, it can accommodate only about 30   
people. Since the smoke coming out of the incense sticks and dasangam were  
huge, Bhagavan Ramana who was sitting very close to them, was finding it  
difficult even to breathe. The smoke engulfed the whole Hall. Bhagavan  
Ramana was ostensibly irritated. He told the attendants: "See, here a living  
Swami is   
sitting and this Swami is not able to even breathe. Go and place all the  
sticks and dasangam to the Kallu Swami (the stone idol of   
Bhagavan, which had been installed in the front hall of Mother's   
Temple, with a stone sofa). The Kallu Swami will have no difficulty in  
breathing..Nor would it complain....Anyway, tomorrow you are all going to put  
garlands and light incense sticks only to that Kallu Swami."   
Everyone in the Hall burst into laughter. The attendant put out   
some of the incense sticks and dasangam, to reduce the volume of smoke. There  
was however, a prophetic line in Bhagavan Ramana's outburst. Yes. The living  
Swami attained Maha Nirvana and then only Kallu Swami remains today! But the  
Asramam authorities have seen to it, that there is no garland for Bhagavan  
Ramana's staute, nor incense sticks and dasangam are lighted.   
Arunachala Siva.
