Dear nonduel,   
 Any idea is thought.Thought is a response of memory which is material in nature.When you meditate on an idea there is a meditator   
and the idea which is meditated upon.In this process there is duality,division  
of the mind which is bound to bring conflict because of friction between   
two entities.Then meditation becomes another mental activity.Is meditation  
something to do with thought or something to do with pure consciousness?

Dear Raju and non duel, Meditation is dual, thought-involved.   
It is "dhyana", as Bhagavan says in Who am I? The meditation,   
fructifies into realization of the Self. For that matter, even   
enquiry is dual, because, there is an enquirer and an enquired.   
When enquiry ceases and attains the goal, one is the Self.   
That is why, I said, "thoughtlessness is self realization", but   
"srkudai" is feeling otherwise. About that, a separate post.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai,   
 True meditation is spontaneous,it is not a deliberate mental activity.Yes,it is being.

Dear srkudai, The answers for the states of meditation are slowly   
coming! Good!   
Bhagavan mentions three types of meditation in Upadesa Saram,   
With words audible outside, the mantra japa,   
With words within, no audible, the silent mantra japa   
No words, only a 'bhavana', I am Siva, I am Siva or I am Brahman   
I am Brahman.   
The first two are 'thinking medittion'. The third one, is non-   
thinking'. Bhagavan uses the word 'unnuthal' in Tamil Upadesa   
Undiyar (Upadesa Saram). Unnuthal means a bhavana. It is   
continuous like flow of oil, thyla dhara.   
So meditation can be thoughtful or thoughtless. But in the   
third, there is bhavana - mental conviction. So all are dual   
and not nondual.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanianji,   
 yes, thats very true.   
and he also says   
bhavana Bidha, Pavani mathah Without bhavana, with a purified mind !   
I think Upadesha Saram ; word by word translation and discussion would be very  
very useful.   
We can start with one verse; discuss it, allow everyone to comment and  
then arrive at a summary and proceed to the next : I think you are the best  
person to organize it.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear srkudai, I shall, Bhagavan willing try to do it, after   
completing Panchadasi, which is a massive work. For Upadesa   
Saram, I shall follow Osborne's translation, after consulting   
Sri Sadhu Om's and Smt Kanakammal's Tamil commentary. I want   
to get the first book, when I go to T.malai, coming Monday. My wife   
has already said that I should restrict my book purchases to less than   
Rs 1000.00. I have got Bhagavan with me to select the best ones.   
Arunachala Siva.
