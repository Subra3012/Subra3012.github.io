Swami Sivananda Saraswati (September 8, 1887âJuly 14, 1963) was a Hindu  
spiritual teacher and a well known proponent of Sivananda Yoga and Vedanta.   
Sivananda was born Kuppuswami in Pattamadai, **in the Tirunelveli district of  
Tamil Nadu.**   
He studied medicine and served in Malaya as a physician for several years  
before taking up monasticism. He lived most of the later part of his life near  
Muni Ki Reti, Rishikesh.   
He is the founder of The Divine Life Society (1936), Yoga-Vedanta Forest  
Academy (1948) and author of over 200 books on yoga, vedanta and a variety of  
other subjects. He established Sivananda Ashram, the location of the  
headquarters of The Divine Life Society (DLS), on the bank of the Ganges at  
Shivanandanagar, at a distance of 3 kilometres from Rishikesh.   
Sivananda Yoga, the yoga form propagated by him, are now spread in many parts  
of the world through Sivananda Yoga Vedanta Centres, but these centres are not  
affiliated with Swami Sivananda's original ashrams which are run by the Divine  
Life Society.   
After a few years, Sivananda went on an extensive pilgrimage and traveled the  
length and breadth of India to meditate at holy shrines and study with  
spiritual teachers throughout India. During this Parivrajaka (wandering monk)  
life, Sivananda visited important places of pilgrimage in the south, including  
Rameshvaram. He conducted Sankirtan and delivered lectures during his travels.  
He visited the Sri Aurobindo Ashram and met Maharishi Suddhananda Bharati.   
**At the Ramana ashram, he had the Darshan of Ramana Maharshi on Maharshi 's  
birthday.He sang bhajans and danced in ecstasy with Maharshi's bhaktas.  
He also went on pilgrimages to various places in northern India including  
Kedarnath and Badrinath. He visited Kailash-Manasarovar in 1931.   
Swami Sivananda's two foremost disciples were Swami Chidananda and Swami  
Krishnananda. Swami Chidananda was appointed President of the Divine Life  
Society by Swami Sivananda in 1963 and served in this capacity until his death  
in 2008.   
Swami Krishnananda was appointed General Secretary of the Divine Life Society  
by Swami Sivananda in 1958 and served in this capacity until his death in  
2001. Swami Krishnananda is widely regarded as one of the most influential  
theologians and philosophers of the 20th century.   
A prolific author, Swami Sivananda wrote exactly 296 books on a variety of  
subjects: metaphysics, Yoga, religion, western philosophy, psychology,  
eschatology, fine arts, ethics, education, health, sayings, poems, epistles,  
autobiography, biography, stories, dramas, messages, lectures, dialogues,  
essays and anthology.Yet his books emphasized the practical application of  
yoga philosophy over mere theoretical knowledge.   
**He was known to have said "An ounce of practice is better than tons of  
theory. Practice Yoga, Religion and Philosophy in daily life and attain Self-  
realization."**   
Swami Sivananda died on 14 July 1963 in his Kutir on the bank of Ganges, in  
Shivanandanagar.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Hanuman Chalisa - Verse 1  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: May 28, 2010, 09:53:09 AM  
---  
**Verse 1**   
 _Shri Guru Charan Saroj Raj   
Nij mane mukure sudhar   
Varnao Raghuvar Vimal Jasu   
Jo dayaku phal char _   
**Meaning** :  **After cleansing the mirror of my mind with the pollen dust of holy Guru 's  
Lotus feet. I Profess the pure,untainted glory of Shri Raghuvar which bestows  
the four-fold fruits of life.(Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha).**   
 **Commentary :**   
So here purification of mind is the preliminary step.There are various ways to  
purify our mind like association with sages,participating in satsangh like  
this forum,renounciation of ego,detachment with general mass of  
people,devotion to god.....   
As RamaKrishna Paramahamsa says,   
 **The mind is like a needle covered with mud, and God is like a magnet.The  
needle cannot be united with the magnet unless it is free from mud. Tears wash  
away the mud, which is nothing but lust,anger, greed, and other evil  
tendencies, and the inclination to worldly enjoyments as well.   
Let the milk of your mind be turned into the butter of Divine Love by means of  
religious practices in solitude. The mind then will never get mixed with the  
water of worldliness, but will rise above and remain unattached to the world.  
Having attained true knowledge and devotion the mind will stand apart from the  
world.**   
Now this is possible with the grace of guru and surrender to guru is very much  
required.   
 **Now coming to the four fruits of life (Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha)  
which we consider four ends or aims of human life.**   
They are (ordered from least to greatest): Kama - "wish, desire, love and sensual pleasure"   
Artha - "wealth, prosperity, glory"   
Dharma - "righteousness, duty, morality, virtue, ethics", encompassing notions  
such as ahimsa (non-violence) and satya (truth)   
Moksha - "liberation", i.e. liberation from Saṃsara, the cycle of  
reincarnation.   
So least preference of Kama,Artha should be given and we should always adhere  
to Dharma and **strive for moksa which is detaching from non-Self and absence  
of ego though complete destruction is not possible as stated by bhagavan  
ramana.**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ 50 Divine Thoughts Courtesy Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: May 28, 2010, 10:06:31 AM

Source And Courtesy : http://www.kamakoti.org/miscl/divine50.html   
I request readers to access the above link to read all the 50 divine  
thoughts.i will paste here few important ones.   
The medicine of Grace to wipe out our sorrows is to develop unshakable faith  
in God and tolerance is the medicine of Grace to wipe out our sorrows. Bhakti  
alone can give us the capacity to put up with sorrows. Temples are the  
agencies for developing that Bhakti. Hence, the need for temples at all  
places. All offerings to the deities in the temples are tokens of our  
gratitude to God.   
In all that you do, let love be the sole motive. Any need must be with  
reference to another **.Let action be out of love. Passions such as desire and  
hatred, anger and malice must be totally eschewed.** If love becomes the  
grounding principle of all deeds. then most of the ills of the world will  
vanish.   
What is the purpose of human birth? To earn, to eat, to undergo misery  
everyday and finally to die? Instead of earning and suffering, can we not die  
now? The purpose of birth is to avoid re-birth. Except man, all animals grow  
horizontally. Only man grows vertically. Instead of growing horizontally, it  
is God's will that he should grow vertically in order to look up. God has  
given to animals devices for self-protection; to man alone He has given  
intelligence. **By doing nothing, we avoid re-birth; By giving up attachment,  
we avoid sins.**   
When any object is consumed by fire, it becomes charred. If that black residue  
is burnt again, it becomes white ash. White ash continues to remain white even  
when burnt again. This shows that white is the ultimate and black is proximate  
to it. Science tells us that diamond and coal are basically one. White and  
black are not colours. The primary colours get separated from the objects to  
which they are attached when subjected to the test of fire and ultimately  
white.Similarly, in the mental and spiritual place, the Ultimate Reality is  
Siva, who is white and proximate to Him is Parvati, who is dark. When we test  
everything in the fire of Jnana, or true knowledge, the residue is Siva. Ash  
in the material plane corresponds to Siva in the spiritual plane. **We smear  
our bodies with the sacred ash to remind ourselves of Siva and the fact that  
the ultimate goal of life is Siva.**   
Right education should make us know that God is the Truth. Knowledge must fill  
one with good qualities, through which one can realise the Truth, that is God.  
Therefore, the goal of knowledge is the understanding of the Ultimate Truth.  
The first fruit of education must be humility and self control.   
 **Why so many Gods? Is it not enough to have only one? Other religions speak  
of one God only and not many. We are assailed by such doubts. We eat to  
satisfy hunger, the stomach becomes full, there is no trouble or hunger. Then  
why can 't we take cooked rice alone? Why should we eat so many side dishes?  
So, if we eat, it is just not to fill the stomach, but we want food tasty to  
the palate and pleasing to the eyes. Whoever is attracted to a particular God  
he worships that.   
By multiplying wants, we only increase poverty. What is essential for life and  
honour should be made available to all the people of the country. It is for  
this we want plans. Men of means should live like the poor and should not  
increase their wants beyond necessities. The rich should share their  
prosperity with the poor. This is punya, leading to salvation. The more we  
increase our wants, to that extent, there will be no peace or comfort and it  
will only produce poverty and sorrow.**   
Vedanta which is the peak of the Vedas teaches the way for the removal of  
sorrow. Hatred and desire arise only in respect of the objects other than us.  
That desire will not arise if those objects are rendered identical with us, if  
there is nothing other than us, then desire will not arise. **If there is no  
desire, there will be no effort and no sin. When there is no sin, there will  
be no body and there will be no misery.**   
 **Our religion Hinduism has grown by devotion, meditation and self -  
purification. The other religions might have grown by propaganda and conflict.  
The reason for crores of our people remaining within the fold of Hinduism, in  
spite of powerful propaganda of other religionists, wars, lure of money, etc.,  
is we see a great man (Mahatma) in our midst by whom we are impressed. We  
develop devotion to him and generate faith in our religion. There is a text in  
the Veda which says that a flowering tree attracts bees automatically. If we  
examine ourselves and we find one of use to be perfect, the world will follow  
him.**   
 **It is clear to us that there is birth and there is death.Passion is the  
cause of birth. Time is the cause of death. What is created by passion is  
destroyed by time.** If passion comes, the seed sprouts. If time comes, the  
tree dies. Kaalo Jagat Bhakshaka: Even the sun and the moon disintegrate when  
time comes. If there is no passion, there is no production. If there is no  
time then there is no destruction. Therefore we have to conquer Kaala and  
Kaama. Iswara burnt Kaama and kicked time. So if we go to Him, there is  
neither birth nor death for us. Let us therefore pay to the Universal Father  
and Mother.   
**Our minds should automatically seek and cling to God just as iron filings  
are attracted by the magnet; the heart of the chaste wife seeks her husband;  
the creeper embraces the tree; the rivers go to the sea.**   
A mother may tie the hands of her child who has the propensity to pick up and  
eat mud. This seeming cruelty of the mother is for the good of the child.  
Similarly troubles are verily God's grace to save us. In the entire picture of  
life, troubles form but a tiny spot. In our inability to visualise the past  
and the future, we complain when we suffer in the present. A proper  
perspective will enable us to understand our present plight in its proper  
setting.   
Whenever any honour is done to a person the recipient must remember the divine  
source from which he derived the qualifications to receive that honour, and  
feel humble and not elated with a feeling of self - importance.   
 **Cultivate Friendly attitude to conquer the minds of men;   
Look at others as yourself;   
Give up war; give up jealousy;   
Don't commit aggression without reason;   
Mother earth is like Kamadhenu to fulfil wishes;   
The Lord God is like father showering mercy   
People of the World !   
Live with discipline;   
Live with charity;   
Live with mercy;   
May all people attain greater well - being**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Shivarudra Balayogi  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: May 28, 2010, 10:54:20 AM

http://www.gita-society.com/newadditions/balayogi.htm   
http://www.gurusfeet.com/guru/shivarudra-balayogi#tabset-1   
Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj (born 20 September 1954), born Srinivas  
(Seenu) Dikshitar in Kolar in the South Indian state of **Karnataka**, is a  
Self Realized Yogi and direct disciple of Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj.   
After meeting his Guru at the age of sixteen, Seenu performed 20 years of  
vigorous service and meditation under Shri Shivabalayogi's guidance at his  
Dehradun ashram in the foothills of the Himalayas.Soon after the physical  
passing of his Guru in 1994, Srinivas entered a stage known as tapas --  
intense and unbroken dhyana (meditation) in which the mind is kept in perfect  
thoughtlessness. By performing tapas for around 20 hours a day continuously  
for five years, he achieved Enlightenment/Self Realization.   
Based in the Dehradun ashram, he now travels to many parts of the world  
teaching meditation and continuing his Guru's mission. He has established  
numerous meditation groups in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia,  
Malaysia, Singapore and around India.   
In his book on Indian spirituality, renowned Vedanta scholar Adwaita P.  
Ganguly writes, "Baba Shivarudra Balayogi is the embodiment of gentleness,  
compassion and service to humanity. He is also resolute and immovable as  
Silence itself."   
At the age of six or seven, he became mesmerized upon hearing his sister  
singing Bhaja Govindam, composed by the great Yogi-teacher Adi  
Shankaracharya.The spiritually precocious child immediately learned the  
Sanskrit verses, began singing them and contemplating their meaning.   
During his teenage years, Seenu spent much of his time at various temples  
around his home, sitting quietly by himself.He would comtemplate the meaning  
of jnana (knowledge), bhakti (devotion) and vairagya (detachment) from the  
teachings of Adi Shankaracharya, and longed for a Guru of the calibre of Shri  
Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and **Shri Ramana Maharshi**.   
 **Few Quotes :**   
Once you Realize that you are this Immortal Self, you will Realize that your  
very existence is Permanent and Supreme Peace.   
Every one, consciously or unconsciously, is searching for peace and happiness.  
You are suffering because you have forgotten your real Self. Once you Realize  
that you are this Immortal Self, you will Realize that your very existence is  
Permanent and Supreme Peace.   
"The mind can never tell the truth because it can tell you only based on its  
own imaginations. So meditation can definitely help you to really surrender,  
technologically surrender in every way. Surrender means that the mind has to  
become quiet. Not simply if we touch our heads and do a deep prostration do we  
convey surrender."

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Hanuman Chalisa - Verse 2  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: May 28, 2010, 10:27:06 AM  
---  
Verse 2   
 _Budhi Hin Tanu Janike   
Sumirau Pavan Kumar   
Bal budhi Vidya dehu mohe   
Harahu Kalesa Vikar _   
**Meaning** :  **Fully aware of the deficiency of my intelligence, I concentrate my  
attention on Pavan Kumar and humbly ask for strength, intelligence and true  
knowledge to relieve me of all blemishes, causing pain.**   
 **Commentary :**   
In this verse complete surrender to god is recommended.As ramana maharshi says  
surrender of our mind/ego is really like surrending to god.   
We completly surrender to god to gain strength,intelligence which will help us  
to remove our ignorance and to attain atma-jnana which can ultimately relieve  
us from this cycle of birth and death.   
Verse 468 Of Guru Vachaka Kovai Says,   
In ancient days the chaste lady [Draupadi] had her honour saved and her sari  
lengthened by the Grace of Lord Krishna only when at last, letting go of her  
own hold on her sari, she lifted up both her hands in complete surrender to  
Him; and the strong wicked one [Duchasana] who was stripping her fell down  
abashed.   
This incident is pointed out there in order to instruct us that we should give  
up the sense of doership and should thus surrender to God completely and  
unreservedly.   
As ramana maharshi says,   
There are only two ways to conquer destiny or to be independent of it. One is  
to enquire whose this destiny is and to discover that only the ego is bound by  
it and not the Self, and that the ego is non-existent. The other way is to  
kill the ego by completely surrendering to the Lord, realising ones  
helplessness   
Complete surrender does imply that we should have no desire of our own, that  
Gods will alone is our will and we have no will of your own.   
In Nan-yar Paragraph Thirteen Ramana Maharshi Says,   
Being completely absorbed in atma-nishtha [self-abidance, the state of just  
being as we really are],giving not even the slightest room to the rising of  
any thought other than atma-chintana selfcontemplation,the 'thought' of our  
own real self], is giving ourself to God. Even though we place whatever amount  
of burden upon God, that entire amount he will bear. Since one paramesvara  
sakti [supreme power of God] is driving all activities [that is, since it is  
causing and controlling everything that happens in this world], why should we  
always think, 'it is necessary [for me] to act in this way; it is necessary  
[for me] to act in that way', instead of being [calm, peaceful and happy]  
having yielded [ourself together with our entire burden] to that [supreme  
controlling power]? Though we know that the train is carrying all the burdens,  
why should we who travel in it suffer by carrying our small luggage on our  
head instead of leaving it placed on that [train]?

## giving up the things in Gaya  
Author: ramanaduli          Date: May 28, 2010, 09:51:27 PM  
---  
Once I met one couple who went to kashi and Gaya. After meeting them I thought  
what a devotion both got and went to Kashi.But my surprise did not live long  
after hearing the story. Slowly we started the conversation. I asked them  
have you given up anything there, elders say that if you go to gaya you should  
give up one fruit, one leave and one vegitable. Here that lady told me with  
little sadness, that she gave up paharkai (bitter guard).I know mami loves  
bitter guard very much but her husband hates it. Then when I asked what about  
mama.(her husband)   
Immiedietly that gentle man told me, I cannot eat my favourite Koiya Pazhalm.  
I wondered how it happen. Then that lady told me   
there when the sastri asked mama to give up one vegetable, he told him we both  
give up paharkai which he does not like it, without asking me. In the same  
way, by accidently I told the sastri to give up the fruit koiya without asking  
mama. But both were laughing and told this is the play of God. In our hindu  
system when you grow old you should have control on your taste so they  
designed such things. But people do for the sake of sastra and continue the  
same style after coming from gaya.In general people leave which they do not  
like or easily not available. People who likes pan very much they should give  
up the pan leaves instead they give up the THEYAL ILLAI. i.e. in south they  
stich lotus leave and some trees leave and use like a plate to eat. They say  
"I went to Kashi so please do not serve on this leave". If we read  
Bhagavan's teaching it would help people to give up something slowly and  
completely.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
What is the purpose behind giving up things? It is giving up desires.   
But in practice, the "devotees" try to cheat the god and themselves.   
These persons leave the items they desire the least. Is it really   
a non-attachment? Never. Persons should leave mango fruits,   
greens (for leaves) and beans or avaraikai. These are real   
non attachments. My sister left pine-apple which we rarely   
eat, betel leaves (OK) and bitter gourd. These are all cheating.   
Bhagavan Ramana, voluntarily stopped eating more than once in   
a day for 365 days, in Virupaksha Cave. He did not eat for 27 days   
at a stretch in Patala Lingam. Of course, these were not deliberate,   
but He just wanted to go without the botheration of eating! This   
is something very high in non-attachment.   
Non attachment should be followed in its real sense.   
In modern days, one should leave cigarettes, watching TV and   
wearing silk dhotis. How many can do this?

## giving up the things in Gaya

Once I met one couple who went to kashi and Gaya. After meeting them I thought  
what a devotion both got and went to Kashi.But my surprise did not live long  
after hearing the story. Slowly we started the conversation. I asked them  
have you given up anything there, elders say that if you go to gaya you should  
give up one fruit, one leave and one vegitable. Here that lady told me with  
little sadness, that she gave up paharkai (bitter guard).I know mami loves  
bitter guard very much but her husband hates it. Then when I asked what about  
mama.(her husband)   
Immiedietly that gentle man told me, I cannot eat my favourite Koiya Pazhalm.  
I wondered how it happen. Then that lady told me   
there when the sastri asked mama to give up one vegetable, he told him we both  
give up paharkai which he does not like it, without asking me. In the same  
way, by accidently I told the sastri to give up the fruit koiya without asking  
mama. But both were laughing and told this is the play of God. In our hindu  
system when you grow old you should have control on your taste so they  
designed such things. But people do for the sake of sastra and continue the  
same style after coming from gaya.In general people leave which they do not  
like or easily not available. People who likes pan very much they should give  
up the pan leaves instead they give up the THEYAL ILLAI. i.e. in south they  
stich lotus leave and some trees leave and use like a plate to eat. They say  
"I went to Kashi so please do not serve on this leave". If we read  
Bhagavan's teaching it would help people to give up something slowly and  
completely.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
What is the purpose behind giving up things? It is giving up desires.   
But in practice, the "devotees" try to cheat the god and themselves.   
These persons leave the items they desire the least. Is it really   
a non-attachment? Never. Persons should leave mango fruits,   
greens (for leaves) and beans or avaraikai. These are real   
non attachments. My sister left pine-apple which we rarely   
eat, betel leaves (OK) and bitter gourd. These are all cheating.   
Bhagavan Ramana, voluntarily stopped eating more than once in   
a day for 365 days, in Virupaksha Cave. He did not eat for 27 days   
at a stretch in Patala Lingam. Of course, these were not deliberate,   
but He just wanted to go without the botheration of eating! This   
is something very high in non-attachment.   
Non attachment should be followed in its real sense.   
In modern days, one should leave cigarettes, watching TV and   
wearing silk dhotis. How many can do this?   
Arunachala Siva.
