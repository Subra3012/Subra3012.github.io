'Who are you to teach others?   
He who is the Lord of the Universe will teach everyone.   
He alone teaches us.'   
(from 'the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna', February 1882)

末学浅见如下;   
Desire to teach others comes from arrogance.   
It makes him feel good to teach others.   
It makes ego feel good.   
The best form of humility is to keep quiet.

There is no teacher, at least in this Forum. We are all students of Bhagavan  
Ramana. We are all in   
a Sat Sangh (a group of devotees in search for the Goal) and we are sharing  
the ideas and get them   
corrected by fellow students or clarified by Bhagavan Ramana, if none of the  
students clarify them   
correctly.   
Arunachala Siva.
