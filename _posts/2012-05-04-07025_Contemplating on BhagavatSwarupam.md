## Contemplating on BhagavatSwarupam  
Author: latha               Date: May 04, 2012, 12:36:21 AM

Namaste All,   
I have been blessed to listen to Srimad Bhagavatham by Sri Nochur  
Venkataramanji. This has made me contemplate on BhagavatSwarupam or seeing God  
in everyone. Coincidentally in my Bhagavad Gita class Swamiji was talking  
about seeing Bhagavan in all the human beings(Chap 9 verse 11). Any  
suggestions to help achieve this state? We hear God is everywhere all the time  
but the message does not seem to sink in.   
Om Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya

Lathaji,   
 **" This has made me contemplate on BhagavatSwarupam or seeing God in  
everyone."**   
Depending on what motivates us,we may approach this subject.Approaching it  
through the framework of thoughts is always misleading;Analogy may help and  
yet it will not be the same as experiencing this.   
Let us approach this through an analogy-we all breathe the same air.We realize  
how breath is vital to our living and we realize that it is vital for one and  
all-all living beings. _We do not have to see this Fact in all;it is enough to  
know it for ourselves and we know that it is universally true._ Whatever is  
breathing through us,this thing called Life,this is what is animating all-  
whose essence is Sat,chit and ananda, this essence needs to be discovered in  
us.To the degree this is appreciated in us,to that degree we will come to  
understand its presence in others.Behind the mask of outer personality,it is  
this 'One Life' that is breathing through all.The acme of this is when we drop  
the limiting circle of the Ego and find that Satchitananda alone is.   
Just like we do not think of air as present everywhere and at all time,and we  
simply breathe in the plenitude-Likewise,space and time will lose its meaning  
as we perceive and live in the essence-Bhagavath swaroopa.   
To discover this essence in us is to see it everywhere and in everyone or  
nowhere and no one in particular!For this, assiduous Sadhana is advised.Once  
we get a taste for this,this in itself will pull us more and more into its  
ambiance.   
One problem that I have observed is that many of the swamijis delve too much  
in the realm of ideas(I do not intend to criticize them).Nochur Venkatraman is  
an exception and he is truly a great soul.Listening to his Talks on  
Bhagavatham is indeed a very fruitful sadhana.   
Namaskar.

Dear i,   
you have already begun seeing everybody, everything as Brahmaswaropam,  
Atmaswaroopam, Bhagawathswaroopam. Just we lack the belief, or conviction,  
that we truly do! You are already doing, what perhaps a sincere sadhaka would  
do in the said circumstances, keep listening to Brahmasri Nochur pravachanams,  
He himself takes you there. In some pravachnam, he said, Bhagavan's quote  
"Self is ever here, only we have to claim it" but we are not convinced enough  
to claim it, we feel, we are not there yet, and truly so, because of our  
doshas, the conviction is spontaneous when, we are completely pure and free of  
the doshas.   
Do watch this excellent documentary on Buddha at leisure -   
http://www.pbs.org/thebuddha   
it is an excellent peak into the life of Buddha, which is quite relevant to  
your question, which is everybody's question.   
really an interesting contemplative question to read the first in the day!   
Salutations to Bhagavan

Dear Sri Nagaraj,   
Yes,so true. Doership belongs to ego only,and only whille we believe we are  
separate that qiestion arise. Indeed,there is only All pervading Self,dreaming  
many dreams,and all those dreams are same in one aspect-it is a dream of world  
and separate existence. In essence,there is no surrender either. Who is there  
to surrend,and what?! There must be the "one" who is surrendering. Because,in  
seeing unreality of I and mine,of world alltogether,there is no one left to  
surrender anything. The one who is doing and trying all that is the root of  
the problem. Then,finally,even those efforts,and strivings,are seen like play  
of the mind,play of the elements and gunas only. Every single thought,every  
"doing",everything which puts us in the role of "the one who is separate",the  
ego,is only a play,nothing more. The Self is unattached,only witness of it.   
So beautiful thoughts to ponder.   
Thank You!   
With love and prayers,

Dear Nagaraj - Beautifully written. Yes - Surrender is another game of ego.  
Because for your to surrender, it initially means it is yours. If I say, I  
give up / surrender my Rolls Royce - people will laugh - because to start with  
I dont have one. Same is the case with surrender - most times it is ego which  
feels happy upon surrender because ego feels it had something which it has  
given up.   
Sanjay.

Dear Nagarajji, Sanjayji, Jewellji, Subramanianji and Friends,   
Thank you for sharing your thoughts. Yes Nagarajji, it all comes back to the  
ego. I was listening to Sri Nochurji say that "summa iru" means to stop the  
ego from arising. He says it goes hand-in-hand with self-enquiry or Naan yaar  
vichaaram.   
As a simple example, my puppy has been sick from yesterday and it is very hard  
to watch her suffer. But I understand it is only my ego that feels so bad  
because it is MY puppy. Every incident is an opportunity to do self-enquiry.   
Om Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya

Surrender is not an action, but an attitude. I think the intellect plays a  
role in developing and maintaining this attitude, but not sure. Surrender to  
me is the acceptance that things come and go as they are meant to.. a feeling  
like a blade of grass that sways with the breeze neither trying to resist nor  
trying to sway by itself, neither feeling happy about blowing one way nor sad  
about blowing another way. I have surrendered this way to God/Guru.. it has  
removed all doubts and led to peace.   
I only pray that the Guru Tiger's jaws never release me!   
Deepa

Deepa Ji   
You are very correct. It is also important to note that you are nobody to even  
accept things as they come. You are just the witness whether ego accepts it  
or not - is not a problem for Self / Atma. Witness even the non acceptance of  
situation by ego in worst of prarabdha. The biggest test of surrender is when  
ego goes through the worst of prarabdha. It is very easy for ego to survive  
the storm of Atma Jnana when everything is going great. That is why I pray  
always to give me worst of prarabdha - and I have got it successfully in last  
5-7 years. Also it is important to give up "attachment" to the physical body  
of guru.   
Namaskaram   
Sanjay.
