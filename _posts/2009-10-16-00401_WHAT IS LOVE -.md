## Sri Dakshinamurty - the Formless and the Form  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 16, 2009, 08:35:17 AM

Sri Dakshinamurty is actually a Formelss Self. A spiritual guru   
who looks at his right chest from the north pole facing south.   
It is dakshina-amurty. South facing formless god, a paradox.   
Spritual North Pole, the Deathless, looking at the south, the   
traditional direction of death, god of death, Yama, in Hindu   
pantheon.   
For people, who like forms to do meditation, he is described   
as follows: The Sages of Namisaranya forest came to him. His body is   
cool and has the coolness of a marble, spotless white, with   
white holy ashes. His feet are like red corals and his four hands   
are like four lotuses. His mouth too is like a red lotus. The   
upper right hand has got a rudraksha bead, strings of beads that   
came from his tears for the downtrodden. His right eye represents   
sun and the left the moon. The third eye represents the Fire,   
fire of knowledge for people who understand him and the fire   
of destruction for the ignorant. His lower right hand shows the   
chinmudra the hand-pose. The forefinger is the Jivatma and the   
thumb is the Paramatma. When the index finger stoops to the   
bottom of the thumb, leaving the remaining three fingers representing, ego,  
desire, and karma, the Jivatma gets united   
with the Paramatma.   
His left upper hand shows a pot of nectar, that liberates the   
Jivas. The dark patch of poison on the throat shows that   
one should not swallow the poison of death but retain to   
wait for the grace of Guru. He is the guru sitting at a stone   
like banyan tree, the stone structure reminding us that he   
is ageless, unlike trees that grow and wither. He is ever   
youthful, showing that the Self is every young, nitya, eternal,   
without old senility, disease and death.   
Arunachala Siva.

When the mind is killed, you are the Self. Satyam-Nyayam-Dharmam,   
Satyam-Sivam-Sundaram, Prajna Parimita, Existence-Knowledge-Bliss,   
Maha Sunya, ALL these are names. Who cares? If one becomes   
the Sugar candy, what does it matter to you, if one calls it sweet, another   
sour and the third bitter? If you are the Rose, what does it matter to   
you, if one calls it pink, another green and the third black?   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, the Eye, the limitless eye, as Bhagavan said,   
will be known to you only when you go past the organic   
eye, not only eye but all the cognative and contative senses.   
Till such time, you will only be eyeing for the Eye, which is   
within you.   
Arunachala Siva.

You have not experienced love but you are trying to describe it.Such things  
hinder your spiritual development.   
When you shed all that is what you are not what remains as residue is love.It  
is thing to be experienced,not to be described.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, Wonderful reply. We are only   
describing all these births, without becoming. We   
are describing the rose, the sugar candy et al.   
Arunachala Siva.
