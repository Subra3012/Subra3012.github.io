Sri Soundarya Lahari Saptaham or the Seven days Chanting of   
Sri Soundarya Lahari was started by the Pontiff of Sri Sarada   
Math, Sringeri, a few years back. It is popular in Karnatka   
and Tamil Nadu. From today, that is Kartika Poornima Saptami   
to Kartik Poornima (1st December) the select verse of Sri Soundarya Lahari, a  
Devi Stuti of Sri Sankara, is chanted 24 or 108 times,   
along with full chanting of 100 verses once. This takes about   
45 minutes. The songs are chanted or sung in Sindhu Bhairavi   
Raga. This year the first verse has been selected. Siva Saktya   
yukto....   
Kartik Sashti is Skanda's festival. From Saptami Devi worship   
starts. On Poornima Siva shines in all His glory on the Hill   
of Arunachala!   
Arunachala Siva.

## Lighting Lamps on Kartika Poornima Evening  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: November 24, 2009, 12:54:19 PM

Kartik is a month of lighting lamps. In houses, women light   
earthern lamps around sunset and this is popular in South   
India. On the Poornima evening, the earthern and silver lamps   
are lighted after seeing Arunachala Deepam or around that time,   
this year it is around 5.45 PM (IST) on 1st December 2009.   
Once when Seshadri Swamigal was in his body, there was   
one Mudaliar (I forgot his first name), who used to spend   
money on tons of gingley oil, earthern lamps and wicks and   
light earthern lamps in hundreds in Tiruvannamalai. On a   
particular Kartik Poornima evening it was very windy. Seshadri   
Swamigal told Mudaliar with thunderbolt like laughter: "Oh,   
Mudaliar, are you going to light lamps today?"   
It so happened, Mudaliar could not light many lamps that   
evening. The earthern lamps lighted were put off due to   
winds. Seshadri came to Mudaliar and said: O fool! Do not   
try to light lamps aping Arunachala Deepam. Instead, feed   
the poor in hundreds by cutting ash-gourd and preparing Sambhar and good  
rice. Mudaliar prostrated before Swamigal and immediately arranged for  
feeding hundreds of people who came   
for Deepam and Giri Pradakshina. He continued this practice   
till his death.   
Arunachala Siva.

## preparation for our end

Now we all know one day we have to leave our family and our home. In normal  
life when we travel, before the station"s arrival, we collect our things and  
go and stand near the door to get down from the train.   
Even it is the last destination we prepare ourselves. But in our life even  
though death is unknown we never do any preparations. Is it due to fear or  
ignorance? Suppose someone wants to do preparations. Can any one give good  
suggestions.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Death is like a return-ticket but date of travel is not decided   
by us. The date of this open ticket is confirmed only by God.   
So preparations should be life long preparations. Nishkamya   
Karmas, moderate eating, moderate sleeping, not speaking ill   
or good of others, humility, simplicity in our dress and habits,   
and more importantly developing a taste in God or Guru's name   
and doing ardent bhakti and surrender. After some maturity,   
starting self enquiry earnestly. This would enable anyone to   
take the death as it comes, smilingly. Saint Arunagiri Natha   
says: "I am having diseases, penury, little help from others,   
but if you give Jnana Sadasiva devotion, that alone shall save   
me." (Chidambaram Tirupugazh). The song starts as Eluppu   
Thol Narai Nadi kuzhaamidai......   
Arunachala Siva.

"Death is like sleep and forgetting," says Shakespeare. Everyday we   
are sleeping and are we afraid of death? Because, we are sure, we will   
wake up in the morning. Mostly it happens. Bhagavan Ramana says that   
death is also like a long sleep. As we carry our vasanas and thoughts   
jump out in the morning, in death too, the mind carries the vasanas and   
jump out to take another birth. In the case of Jnanis, who attain Nirvikalpa   
Samadhi, the death is invited with both the hands and it is the door for   
liberation. For a Jnani who is in Sahaja Nirvikalpa Samadhi, like Bhagavan   
Ramana, the death has already been conquered. They just go through the   
motions of daily life and then attain the Videha Kaivalyam, the liberation   
without body.   
There is no use in getting afraid of death. Death comes whether you fear   
or not. It is envitable for any living beings. Only thing, we can do, is to   
quickly get the chiddashuddhi, the purification of mind and do the enquiry   
to be ready at the doorsteps of Liberation.   
Arunachala Siva.
