Dear I,   
It is best to ask this question yourself. Whatever anybody tells your here, it  
is going to be absolutely their own experience and evolution. The best person  
to ask this question is yourself (I) and only 'I' can show light on this.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear friend,   
As Nagaraj has said, I shall not venture to tell you my view.   
But I shall tell you what Manikkavachagar, the great Saiva saint   
said: Avan aruLale avan thaaL vanangi..... I am praying to your   
golden feet, due to your grace. In other words, the Sadhana or   
even Sadhana suitable for a particular person, is decided by God   
and His Grace.   
Arunachala Siva.

Assuming that sat-chit-anand was finite \-- that might be the case. One could  
heave bathtubs full of sat-chit-anand "out" of Truth and not decrease it one  
whit -- or fill it with mega oceans of Love and not increase one tiny bit.   
But there is a another aspect one might contend, if so inclined -- that is,  
that the "flow" of sat into the physical world is limited by the nature of the  
world. In this line of thinking, then there would, in fact be a bit more aura  
in the area around the samadhi because of overflow seeping out, so to speak.   
The bottom line of what I think is a consensus is that God is not time or  
space. That implies, that the manifestation on the Holy Hill which is known to  
us as Ramana at Arunachala is there where it always has been and always will  
be.

soham,   
 There is no increase or decrease.   
What is there is here too. what is here is there too. no motion absolutely.   
you are feeling an increase or decrease purely mental states. Due to  
identification with mental states, whenever the mind is calm you say i have  
"received" some power and when its agitated you feel "i have lost some bliss"  
.   
Its just identification with mind. .. the peace is of mind, so it passes away  
too!   
To put it another way. .. that peace which you experienced near Ramana's  
Samadhi was not real. .. it was like an illusion created by a magician. I know  
many people will beat me for it. .. but only that which is Ever Present. ..  
nonchanging is SAT. .. all motion is mithya.   
Love!

You mean total Sat-Chit-Ananda increases as number of tombs of saints  
increases ?  
\-- hardly. I meant that Awareness-Being-Love is not finite (saying that it  
is infinite, is probably not quite the word, but it certainly better than  
"finite").   
In any case, the apparent concentration of peace at a saint's samadhi could  
hardly mean that there was less elsewhere, let alone near the place.   
Mind you, this is just me trying to formulate how this looks to me: when you  
go to a sacred place, at the same time you orient yourself toward a place of  
no time or space (if you don't you won't experience the sacredness of the  
place). This "place" is sat-chit-anand (perhaps more correctly an aspect of  
the Place).   
A lot of people (hopefully most) are to some degree oriented towards God and  
will notice something near an especially sacred place. For this we have the  
witness of a lot of people who been to Arunachala.

Dear Srkudai,   
That "peace" is more real than everithing else. Just don't call in "peace'.  
Don't call in anything at all and don't use your mind to compare. Bhagavan is  
more real than this world.   
Nobody will beat you for what realy exists do nothing.

Question: Can the Gurus silence bring about realisation if the disciple makes  
no effort?   
Sri Ramana Maharshi: In the proximity of a great master, the vasanas (subtle  
impressions that lead to desires) cease to be active, the mind becomes still  
and Samadhi results. Thus the disciple gains true knowledge and right  
experience in the presence of the master. To remain unshaken in it further  
efforts are necessary. Eventually the disciple will know it to be his real  
being and will thus be liberated even while alive.   
\   
The above saying by Bhagavan brings out the following points: 1\. Great Master's presence has an effect on the disciples which stills the  
mind and can even bring about Samadhi. Thus a Great Master's presence is  
"tangible" and not mere imagination.   
2\. Even though the experience felt in the Master's presence fades away when  
the disciple goes away from the Master, it does not mean that the knowledge  
and experience felt in the Master's presence was false/imaginative. It only  
fades away due to the covering of the desires and other thoughts due to  
vasanas. Subsequently when the disciple "uncovers" the knowledge by effort,  
he/she will find that it is qualitatively same as that felt in the Master's  
presence.   
Thus a Great Master can give a "foretaste" of spiritual knowledge to persons  
in spite of their vasanas. These experiences are transformative and often make  
persons mend their ways and take to a spiritual life. How can an ordinary  
person beset with vasanas get a foretaste of spirituality without the presence  
of a saint? Books are of limited help compared to the presence of saints. If  
books keeps a person in 2-dimensional plane, a Master's presence can lift him  
to the 3rd dimension.

When Ramana's physical presence was available, many people used to come and  
sit there in the hall and sleep. Ramana asked Annamalai Swami to take them for  
a walk along the hill. He would say its no better than a good sleep.   
Ramana said that its better to go for a walk to the hill than sit down like  
that and enter into a state of laya.   
The Bliss or Peace experienced in the presence of a saint is not a "Parameter"  
, a "Deciding" factor for anything. Its purely mental state. Self Inquiry may  
be less "Blissful" than say singing some song in praise of God. But Self  
Inquiry is the only Direct Path.   
Peace of mind is only useful if it indicates that I AM THE PEACE. .. when it  
is not a mental identification anymore. Coz its Me. Self. But if one is still  
craving for a particular place for the mental state to occur, that is not Real  
PEACE. It is only emotional outburst. .. due to emotional attachment to the  
particular story. One has to drop that emotional outburst. Coz its still  
identification with mind.   
Arjuna had stayed with Krishna, talked to him, walked and lived with him. ..  
played games and what not! And yet he needed 17 chapters of Bhagavad Gita!!   
Its nice to be emotional about it! That is a moment of dissolved ego. .. but  
if there is no Self Knowledge [/Self Inquiry], that is as good as a good  
dreamless sleep.   
In JivanMukthi Vivekam, Vidhyanarayana Swami explains: "the difference  
between a deep sleep & the state of Self Realization is", "the first case, the  
vasanas are only temporarily at rest, while in the second case the vasanas are  
dissolved completely". In the first case they can arise again, while in the  
second case there is no possibility.

To obtain the grace of the Master, some amount of readiness is required from  
the aspirants also. Because some people fall asleep does not mean that the  
Presence cannot be felt by anyone. Even doing self-enquiry people can fall  
asleep, it does not mean that self-enquiry is wrong. Even discriminating that  
"I am not this...I am not that" people can fall asleep, it does not mean that  
the method is useless.   
The Gopis of Vrindavana has simple faith on Lord Krishna. They obtained the  
highest devotion. Arjuna treated Shri Krishna as his friend and was not  
interested in Self knowledge. But during the beginning of Bhagavat Gita,  
Arjuna, totally confused, surrendered to Krishna. Only then he started getting  
the grace of Shri Krishna. Shri Krishna went out of the way and revealed even  
the Vishwaroopa to Arjuna.   
As long as the mind becomes pure by surrendering to God, emotions are not  
obstructions to self-realization but on the other hand they become aid to it.  
Sri Ramakrishna was emotional throughout his life, so were most of the Alwars  
and Nayanmars.   
With simple-minded faith, devotion and yearning, one receives the grace of  
Bhagavan. People with their own complicated and doubting mind, obstruct the  
grace of saints. They conjure up some logic forgetting that the Self Itself  
has incarnated to shower grace to one and all.

Krishna did not tell Arjuna "Surrender". He taught him 17 chapters and in the  
last chapter. .. he says "Surrender to me and leave all dharma & adharma"   
Only in the last chapter. After the understanding is presented. The first  
statement Krishna says is "You are Deathless". He does not speak about  
himself! He says "You cannot be disturbed". ..   
He did not even just "Transmit " it!   
Ramakrishna was emotional. .. And Vivekananda says in his speaches. .. not to  
get too emotional. He warns people against imitating Ramakrishna. Coz When a  
person is emotional, he explains, he Kundalini raises up and suddenly falls  
down. When it falls down he gets base instincts arising again. This is  
Vivekananada's explanation.   
If Jnani's presence Solves everything. .. Its HERE TOO!   
Simple Minded Faith is Required... Have Faith in this that Ramana is Right now  
embracing you from all directions. You are Swallowed by Ramana now. So then,  
one need not go to Ramana's Samadhi. .. one is swallowed. .. here or there!   
This is Simple Faith One does not depend on a specific place or location  
... one does not depend on a specific time ! One is Free All the Time! coz its  
just impossible to go any farther than Ramana any moment!   
Love!

1\. Sat-Chit Ananda is infinite in the sense, there is only This,   
and and nothing else. This boundless ocean of bliss, also   
contains bubbles with vasanas inside. The bubbles would   
become the Ocean once it breaks and that is destruction of vasanas.   
2\. The Jnana Guru Himself is Satchit Ananda. As one of you   
pointed out, our devoted and concentrated presence in His Presence,   
speed up the destruction of vasanas. In between, even before the   
vasanas are completely burnt out, the glimpse of the Self is conferred by the  
Guru, as a foretaste. It is a dry run of an assasination. Once one is ready,  
the assassination of vasanas   
is complete.   
3\. If one gets Peace in the presence of a Guru, then such a guru   
is Brahma Jnani. A Brahma Jnani even after his leaving the body,   
projects his Peace, if the visitor to the Samadhi is a fit receipient.

I am not sure. Perhaps Vasanas were too heavy that you have
