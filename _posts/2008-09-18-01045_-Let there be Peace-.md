## Indian Cuisine - (5)  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: September 14, 2008, 03:25:07 PM

Dear non dual and others,   
Today's menu is: Mor-kuzhambu. This is hot hot butter milk/   
chilly gravy.   
Take descicated coconut, green chillies, soaked toor dhal   
and jeera and make a paste in the mixer. Take good butter   
milk, not very alkaline, in a vessel and heat it till boils. After   
boiling butter milk is ready, add jack fruit nuts, cut pieces   
of either bendi or ash gourd and heat it again. Check whether   
the vegetable is soft. Then, pour the mixed paste mentioned   
above and stir it the compound nicely for a while. The resultant   
gravy is Mor-kuzhambu. Add curry leaves for taste. No masala   
because the green chilly paste is there.   
This is prepared on a few days in Sri Ramansramam.   
This can be taken with rice only. A separate currey may be   
necessary as a side dish.   
Arunachala Siva.

## "Let there be Peace."  
Author: mark                Date: September 18, 2008, 07:37:19 PM

On realization, you feel complete, fulfilled, free from the pleasure-pain  
complex, and yet not always able to explain what happened, why and how. You  
can put it only in negative terms: "Nothing is wrong with me any longer". It  
is only by comparison with the past that you know that you are out of it.  
Otherwise, you are just yourself. Don't try to convey it to others. If you  
can, it is not the real thing. Be silent and watch it expressing itself in  
action.   
Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj   
While this is not a Ramana quote, it easily could be.. . I find myself  
compelled to speak about realization, and yet everytime I do, I know that it  
has slipped throug my fingers yet again, so to speak.   
I send this with love and compassion for all. May the wars and hatred of self  
be realized for what it is, so that it can finally end. "Let there be peace."

Dear Mark, Wonderful! Yes, the experience can never be reduced   
into words. Lao Tse has said: Those who speak, know not; Those   
who know speak not. In Tamil, they say: 'Kandavar Vindilar;   
Vindavar Kandilar', meaning, those who have seen, cannot express;   
those who express have not seen.'   
Again, one Tamil Saiva Saint, called Thayumanavar, who lived in   
17th century has said a beautiful example. In the morning after   
the nuptial night, the bride comes out of the room and she is   
unable to express anything to any one. Even to her mother, she   
is not able to say anything and she merely, 'looks' at her mother!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Mark,   
Thank you. I am a small pond, reflecting the Sun, Bhagavan Sri
