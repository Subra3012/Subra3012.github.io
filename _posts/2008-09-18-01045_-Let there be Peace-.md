## "Let there be Peace."

On realization, you feel complete, fulfilled, free from the pleasure-pain  
complex, and yet not always able to explain what happened, why and how. You  
can put it only in negative terms: "Nothing is wrong with me any longer". It  
is only by comparison with the past that you know that you are out of it.  
Otherwise, you are just yourself. Don't try to convey it to others. If you  
can, it is not the real thing. Be silent and watch it expressing itself in  
action.   
Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj   
While this is not a Ramana quote, it easily could be.. . I find myself  
compelled to speak about realization, and yet everytime I do, I know that it  
has slipped throug my fingers yet again, so to speak.   
I send this with love and compassion for all. May the wars and hatred of self  
be realized for what it is, so that it can finally end. "Let there be peace."

Dear Mark, Wonderful! Yes, the experience can never be reduced   
into words. Lao Tse has said: Those who speak, know not; Those   
who know speak not. In Tamil, they say: 'Kandavar Vindilar;   
Vindavar Kandilar', meaning, those who have seen, cannot express;   
those who express have not seen.'   
Again, one Tamil Saiva Saint, called Thayumanavar, who lived in   
17th century has said a beautiful example. In the morning after   
the nuptial night, the bride comes out of the room and she is   
unable to express anything to any one. Even to her mother, she   
is not able to say anything and she merely, 'looks' at her mother!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Mark,   
Thank you. I am a small pond, reflecting the Sun, Bhagavan Sri   
Ramana, the son of Siva, matchless after Sankara.   
Arunachala Siva.
