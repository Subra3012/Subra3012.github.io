Dear prasanth,   
I have seen only pictures of Kumbha Mela crowds in newspapers   
and television. I consider that this festival is more religious than   
philosophic. There is one Maha Magam festival celebrated in   
Kumbakonam. Unlike in river, here they take bath in a huge tank,   
which swells with water during that day, i.e. when Jupiter comes to   
the Maga Star in the zodiac of Leo. It is also celebrated once in   
12 years. The crowds are in lakhs and it is more difficult for the   
authorities to manage since everyone has to take bath in a tank   
and not in a large flowing river.   
Arunachala Siva.
