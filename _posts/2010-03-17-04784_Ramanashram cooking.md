Does anybody know the recipe of Sambar etc., in Ramanashram?   
Do onions and garlics are used in Ashram food?   
(Some says onions and garlics are Rajasic. )   
Quantity of salt is large, midium or small?   
How hot is it? (How much chillies are used?)   
(Much salt and chillies are Rajasic, I think.)   
I want to cook Sattvic food, and want to know how they cook in Ramanashram.

Onions are added in the preparation of Sambhar on a few days. They do not do   
it during Navaratri, Dasara festivals. Garlic is not added. Salt is always  
in   
moderate quantities. Rasam is prepared with pepper, tomatoes etc., More,  
buttermilk,   
is quite thick, but it is not curd. Pickles like mango, lime, narthangai  
etc., are   
prepared. Rice is prepared very very nicely. The cooked rice is neither like  
granules   
nor over-cooked like a paste. I think, Brahma, Vishnu and Indra get into  
cooks'   
bodies to prepare food for Ramana devotees. Muruganar used to say Tiru KaN  
Nokkam,   
the Eye meeting the eye, and I think Bhagavan Ramana does TirukanNokkam,  
towards   
the food and make it divine food everyday. My wife tried to prepare such  
Sambhar and failed. Anyway, you can try, praying to Bhagavan. In Rasam, you  
get the nice fragrance   
of the herbs. Payasam, the sweet fluid with jaggery, cashew nuts and dry  
grapes   
and herbs, is something that Parvati would like to gulp everyday. But it is  
prepared   
only on special occasions.   
Arunachala Siva.

You observed Ashram cooking very well.   
I had Ashram food many years ago, but I do not remember well.   
I do not know how to cook well without onions and garlic.   
I am afraid it can be tasteless with ordinary cooking skill.

Akira ji   
One of the previous posts members discussed about the moderate food, desired  
food and at the end vasanas. In hindi they say, JAISA ANN VAISA MANN.   
means what we eat we become. Bhagavan never tells any one you have to do and  
do not do. He lived and through His life He showed us, how to eat   
and how to live so we will be always WE. So the lesson starts from Bhagavan's  
kitchen what and how should be our food.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Akira,   
You can add onions but not garlics. Pray for Bhagavan's Tiru KaN Nokkam, His  
eyes   
gazing at the food you prepare. It would become tasty and divine.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thank you, I understand.   
Garlics were one of my favorites, but now, good bye, garlics.

Letters from Sri Ramanasramam 227   
ALL TAMASIC ARTICLES ARE FORBIDDEN   
Four days ago, we received a copy of Grihalakshmi, a monthly journal. Bhagavan  
was turning over the pages and laughing to himself. I thought there must be  
something amusing in it. While going out, Bhagavan gave me the journal and  
said with a laugh, The greatness of garlic is described in it. Please read  
it. On bringing it home and reading it, I found that there was in it a  
description of how to cook garlic, how to make pickles out of it, how to make  
chutneys and in conclusion it was stated that there is nothing equal to it in  
its greatness and its benefit to the body. I could not help laughing when I  
read it. I then understood why Bhagavan was laughing while he was reading it.  
In the afternoon at 2-30 when I went to Bhagavans presence, Bhagavan smiled  
on seeing me. No sooner did I step into the hall than he said, Well, did you  
read about the greatness of garlic? Was there not also a verse? I replied,  
Yes, I have read it. There is a saying amongst us that the good which garlic  
can do, even a mother cannot do. That verse expresses the same sentiment.   
Bhagavan: Such a saying is prevalent in this part of the country also. People  
say it is very good for health. Really it is so. It removes rheumatism and  
gives strength to the body. For children it acts like amrit (nectar). Garlic  
is also known as amrit.   
Devotee: How did it get that name?   
Bhagavan: There is a curious story about it. As is well known, when gods  
(devas) and demons (rakshasas) churned the ocean, amrit came out of it. When  
the rakshasas were running away with the vessel containing amrit, devas  
appealed to Vishnu. Vishnu came on the scene in the shape of Mohini  
(Enchantress), and offered to resolve their quarrel by serving amrit to them  
all. They agreed. While serving it to the gods first, it appeared that there  
might not be enough to go round for the demons and so one of the latter got  
into the line of the gods unobserved by Mohini and was swallowing the amrit,  
when the Sun and the Moon noticed it and gave her the hint. She threw the  
ladle, with which the amrit was being served, at the demon. The ladle became  
the Chakra (an invincible lethal weapon of Vishnu) and cut off his head, but  
as amrit had already gone down his throat, the head became a graha (planet)  
and has since been taking vengeance on the Sun and the Moon at the time of an  
eclipse. That is the story.   
Now, when the head of the demon was severed, the trunk fell down and, in the  
process, a few drops of amrit also fell on the ground, and it is said that  
those drops became the garlic plant. That is why it is said that garlic has  
some of the properties of amrit. It is very good for the body. But since it  
also has the touch of the demon, it has tamasic qualities too, which affect  
the mind, if eaten. Hence it is forbidden for sadhakas.   
Devotee: Are not horseradish (mullangi) and drumsticks also forbidden for  
sadhakas?   
Bhagavan: Yes. Watermelon, horseradish, drumsticks, onions and other similar  
vegetables are forbidden. The mind will be clear and pure depending on the  
sort of food one eats, sattvic or otherwise. If one overeats sambar, soup and  
boiled vegetables one will have to belch Ho Ho and Ha Ha and get worried  
over digesting it. If, however, one eats sattvic food with only one side dish,  
one digests it easily and will be happy. Who pays attention to such advice?   
Devotee: Why do they not pay attention to such advice? It is rather strange.   
Bhagavan: That is a fact. Nobody heeds such advice. Everyone says he must  
bring for Bhagavan laddoos and jilebis (sweetmeats) but no one says rice and  
pepper water are better for Bhagavan. They bring them all for Swami. But why  
does Swami require all these things? Dandapani Swami was here long back. At  
that time the method of cooking itself was different. A big vessel used to be  
put on the fire. Whatever vegetables were received till noon used to be cut  
and put into it, boiled and sambar made. There was no ladle even to stir and  
mix them. We used to take a piece of firewood, chisel it and use it for  
stirring those vegetables in the vessel. That preparation was the only side  
dish. When we mixed it with rice and ate, it used to be very tasty. The labour  
also was comparatively less. After cooking in the Ashram grew in size, cooks  
had to be appointed. They used to consult me in the early days about what to  
cook. I used to ask them, Do you have rice? and their reply was, yes. Do  
you have water? Yes. Do you have salt? Yes. Do you have pickles?  
Yes. Buttermilk? Yes.  If so, what else do you want? I used to say.  
After that, they ceased to ask me and now they merely tell me, We will cook  
this and we will cook that, and I say, Yes, yes. I also advise them  
suitably. What do I lose? I do not, however, give up my own custom, but mix  
all the side dishes into one before taking them. When several people gather  
together, they must have their way. Why should they suffer on my account?

Thank you for the interesting article, Graham.   
I am not quite sure if I understand why Bhagavan laughted.   
People pay much attention on nutrition (its effect on body),   
but pay little attention on Sattvic-ness (its effect on mind) of food.   
This is how I understand the meaning of Bhagavan's laughter.   
Nutrition consultants talk a lot about how nutritious meat and fish are,   
how harmful being vegetarian to the body etc.,   
It seems that being nutritious is one thing, being Sattvic is another.

Once Bhagavan Ramana was returning from the walk to the Hills   
and on the way back into the Asramam, He found a heap of   
onion peels. He said: "Let someone dig a pit and put these   
peels; if any outsider sees this, he will think that Swami's Asramam   
is serving onions also in the food!"   
This anxiety was never for Him. But He said this because He did   
not want the Asramam to get a bad name. Those days the Brahminic   
rules were quite strict forbidding onions, garlics, drumsticks, mullangi   
etc., But today, who cares? And at the same time, Bhagavan Ramana was a  
Brahmin in the strictest sense, the Jnani who abides   
in Brahman always. For Him, no rules would apply.   
Arunachala Siva.
