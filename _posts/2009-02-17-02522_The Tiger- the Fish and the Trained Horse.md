We have seen how Bhagavan Ramana compared the mind to the   
errant bull, which strays and grazes in other people's fields.   
Saint Manikkavachagar in Tiruvachakam, compares the mind,   
to three forms, the ferocious tiger, the fish and the trained horse.   
When the tiger roams around ferociously in jungles, it is the mind   
with bloated and self centred ego, which takes pleasure in   
injuring others. The tiger thinks it is unconquerable by anyone else. The  
ego also behaves as if nothing can stop its ahankara. Then, Siva comes as a  
hunter. He just kills the tiger with one arrow. Like that, Siva also humbles  
the ego, with one go, that is by giving a great misery in life, or an  
incurable illness or separation from family and other mishaps. This ego does  
not get liberated but only takes another birth.   
The second is the fish in the ocean or river. It behaves very quietly. But  
it has got only basic desires, like food, procreation, safety etc., Siva  
comes here as an expert fisherman. He just gives one worm in the hook and  
nets the fish. Here the fish is not killed. But it is taken as prisoner of  
Siva. The ego of many people are very subdued. They have to fulfill only  
their basic desires. If this is taken care, it comes under the net of  
god/guru.   
The third one is the trained horse. It is in the midst of people. It is in  
city or in a battlefield. It has no desire of its own. If the master gives  
horse-gram and water, it is fine. When the master puts him in the stable  
after the day's work, it is happy to rest. When the horse-man jumps on its  
back, and rides it, the horse simply obeys the directions of the horseman and  
goes, wherever the master/god/guru asks it to go. Here the ego is totally  
subdued. It takes whatever comes from the god/guru, be happy and contented,  
and after the day's work it gets its stable allotted by the master.   
The Saint Poet says in Pandaaya Nanamarai,(the ancient four Vedas), in  
Tiruvachakam, verse 3: He is the hunter in the jungle, he is the fisherman in sea,   
He is the horseman in the city, He will remove our dirts*   
And graces, the Lord of Tiruperundurai, to his lotus feet,   
Let us prostrate and sing, without any delusion or care.   
(* the three dirts, the ego, karma and maya)   
Arunachala Siva.

In the Katha Upanishad can be quoted here: "Know the self as a rider in a chariot,   
and the body, as simply the chariot.   
Know the intellect as the charioteer,   
and the mind, as simply the reins.   
The senses, they say, are the horses,   
and sense objects are the paths around them....   
When a man lacks understanding,   
and his mind is never controlled;   
His senses do not obey him,   
as bad horses, a charioteer."   
Gurudevo Paahi Paahi
