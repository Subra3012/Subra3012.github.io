In many of his recent pravachanams, Sri Nochur Venkataraman recites a dhyana  
slokam "Aavarta Puryam.... Prapadhye". Anyone knows who wrote this? I enjoy  
listening to this and would like to get the lyrics!.

it might be very silly to ask but still he always refers to bhagavan as  
sollithu, kettudhu denoting 'adhu' 'idhu 'instead of sonnaar, kettaar, Shri  
nochur is a great mahan and learned and there should be very valid reasons.  
but do not comprehend as to why.............

Dear Krishnan, dr sundaram, kannan,   
This is a lyric composed by Nochur himself. I do not know the full meaning.  
But it says, that He was born in Avarthapuri,   
(Tiruch chuzhi) and He is Sivam, He is Sivapadam, He is Sivagnanam...etc.,   
2\. Sri Bhavavan is neither male, nor female, nor neuter. He is It, (the  
Self). Hence He is called vandhathu, pOnathu etc.,   
in ahrinai in Tamizh, that is, the suffix used for non human beings.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Kannan and friends,   
If I am not wrong, this is written by Sri Jagadeeshwara Shastri, Bhagavan's  
devotee, who was also instrumental in giving us Hridaya Kuhara Madhye  
completed by Bhagavan. This is call Prapatyashtakam.

drsundaram,   
Quote  
> it might be very silly to ask but still he always refers to bhagavan as  
> sollithu, kettudhu denoting 'adhu' 'idhu 'instead of sonnaar, kettaar  
Nochur Sri Venkatraman, in his talks on the Bhagavad Gita, alluding to Sri  
Bhagavan, used the respectful form of address:"sonnaar, kettaar".He had  
changed this subsequently.   
Sri Bhagavan used this sort of a usage in his letter that he left behind  
before he embarked on his travel to Arunachala!Later on in Tiruvannamalai  
,when the Robbers raided the ashram and belaboured him,he commented "Iddhukkum  
poosai Kidaiththadhu"(This also got a Pooja!,pooja refers to a few blows from  
the Robbers!).Ofcourse in his conversation with devotees, he used to refer  
himself casually as 'I' as well.   
This is the translation of the letter that Sri Bhagavan wrote before leaving  
home in Madurai : "I have, in search of my Father and in obedience to his command, started from  
here. **THIS** is only embarking on a virtuous enterprise. Therefore none need  
grieve over THIS affair. **To trace THIS out**, no money need be spent.   
Your college fee has not been paid. Rupees two are enclosed herewith.   
 Thus ___________________"   
The letter was not signed for his separate identity as Venkataraman had been  
lost after his discovery of his true identity as the Self.   
In the Gospel of sri Ramakrishna,we find the Master charmingly recounting this  
incident: Quote  
> "Gauri would not refer to himself as 'I' lest he should feel egotistic. He  
> would say 'this' instead. **I followed his example and would refer to myself  
> as 'this' instead of 'I'.Instead of saying, 'I have eaten,' I would say,  
> 'This has eaten.'** Mathur noticed it and said one day: 'What is this,  
> revered father? Why should you talk that way? Let them talk that way. They  
> have their egotism. You are free from it; you don't have to talk like them.'  
We may,ofcourse use the expression that we are most comfortable with.Sages  
have used the word 'avan' **' அவன்'**, or 'adhu' **' அது' **as it occurs in  
thayumanavar's song which I will post here.   
Namaskar.

Friends,   
Here is the thayumanavar song,from parasiva vannakkam,Verse 1,wherein he  
refers to the Supreme Being as **எ து** and **அ து**: அங்கிங் கெனாதபடி எங்கும் ப்ரகாசமாய்   
 ஆனந்த பூர்த்தியாகி   
 அருளடு நிறைந்ததெது தன்னருள் வெளிக்குளே   
 அகிலாண்ட கோடியெல்லாந்   
தங்கும் படிக்கிச்சை வைத்துயிர்க் குயிராய்த்   
 **த ழைத்ததெது** மனவாக்கினில்   
 தட்டாமல் நின்றதெது சமயகோ டிகளெலாந்   
 தந்தெய்வம் எந்தெய்வமென்   
றெங்குந் தொடர்ந்தெதிர் வழக்கிடவும் **ந ின்றதெது**   
 எங்கணும் பெருவழக்காய்   
 யாதினும் வல்லவொரு சித்தாகி இன்பமாய்   
 **எ ன்றைக்கு முள்ள தெது** **அ து**   
கங்குல்பக லறநின்ற எல்லையுள **த ெது அ து**   
 கருத்திற் கிசைந்ததுவே   
 கண்டன வெலாமோன வுருவெளிய தாகவுங்   
 கருதிஅஞ் சலிசெய்குவாம்.   
What is it, which is Uncircumscribed Effulgence,   
Perfect Bliss,Divine-Love Filled --   
 **What is it,** which willedTo contain the countless universes   
In boundless space And there flourishes as Life of life, -   
 **What is it**, which stood Transcending thought and word,   
 **What is it**, which remained As the ever contentious object   
Of countless faiths claiming,''This, my God,'' ''This, our God''\--   
 **What is it**, which exists as Omnipresent, Omnipotent   
Love-filled and Eternal -   
 **What is it**, which knows No limits of Night and day -   
 **That indeed** is what is agreeable to thought,   
 **That indeed** is what fills all space in silentness.   
 **That indeed** is what we in meekness worship.

Friends,   
In this very opening song from 'Engu niRaiginRa poruL',Thayumanavar uses the  
personal form of address-He **அ வன்** and You(Thee) **உ னை**:  **அ வனன்றி** யோரணுவும் அசையாதெ னும்பெரிய   
 ஆப்தர்மொழி யொன்றுகண்டால்   
 அறிவாவ தேதுசில அறியாமை ஏதிவை   
 அறிந்தார்கள் அறியார்களார்   
மௌனமொ டிருந்ததார் என்போ லுடம்பெலாம்   
 வாயாய்ப் பிதற்றுமவரார்   
 மனதெனவும் ஒருமாயை எங்கே இருந்துவரும்   
 வன்மையொ டிரக்கமெங்கே   
புவனம் படைப்பதென் கர்த்தவிய மெவ்விடம்   
 பூதபே தங்களெவிடம்   
 பொய்மெயிதம் அகிதமேல் வருநன்மை தீமையொடு   
 பொறைபொறா மையுமெவ்விடம்   
எவர்சிறிய ரெவர்பெரிய ரெவருறவ ரெவர்பகைஞர்   
 **ய ாதுமுனை யன்றியுண்டோ**   
 இகபர மிரண்டினிலும் உயிரினுக் குயிராகி   
 எங்குநிறை கின்றபொருளே!   
 _" Not an atom moveth **without Him** "_ -   
If this great saying of the wise is realized,   
Where then is knowledge?Where then is ignorance?   
Who are they that knew this?Who are they that knew this not?   
Who are they that in silentness sat? Who are they that are loquacious like me,   
My entire body turned into mouth?Where doth the illusion, that is mind, come  
from?   
Where is cruelty from?Where is compassion from?   
Why the creation of this universe?Why the lordly functions arising therefrom?   
Why these diverse elements?Why truth and falsehood?   
Why pleasantness and unpleasantness?Why good and evil?   
Why beneficient things to be?Why the disasters to follow?   
Why the patience and impatience?Who are small?Who are great?   
Who are friends?Who are enemies? _All, all none but **Thee!**_   
Oh! Thou the Pervasive Being That is Life of life Of this world and next!

Yes,I agree and concur.Personally I would avoid this form of addressing Sri  
Bhagavan as 'Adhu','Solliththu',etc.When we talk about the personal aspect of  
God or refer to him as Bhagavan,it is appropriate to use the 'personal' form  
of addressing only.If we talk about the impersonal aspect,we may refer as 'It'  
or 'That' etc.   
Namaskar.

true, very right i feel same way. shri ravi. when i hear shri bhagavn being  
referred to as adhu, idhu solliththu i fee somewhat instinctively as  
demeaning Him. may be i am not matured enough to understand of Bhagavan as  
explained by shri R S that Bhagavan is neither male nor female nor any  
identifiable thing, but he is' that'. ...Om Namo bhagavathe shri ramanaya.

Dear Ravi and Sundaram sir   
Actually it is nothing to do with the formal state or the relevance to texts   
In my opinion, it is a pure melting love, you love somebody so much that  
eventually we address like sollum etc. When I first heard this phrase in the  
lectures, (varum, pogum etc.) my first impression was that He has reached a  
highest level of relationship with the sage that the 'swadheenam' meaning the  
liberty with which we address our kith and kin has dawned upon him.   
Trust me, it is the purest and highest love and all sastric references fall  
short to explain it.   
I remember one anectode from famous bengali saint Bamakshepa of Tarapith. He  
was so mad in his love with Tara devi that he sometimes threw stones at Her  
and used to scold her that She has ruined his life which otherwise would have  
been a normal householder one.   
We ofcourse have one of our 63 nayanmars "kal yerindha saakiyar"   
Buddhist turned Shiva devotee who worshipped Shiva by throwing stones at him.  
Such was his love.   
That is why in No Mind I am the Self, Sri Lakshmana Swamy described this love  
by saying that one can read the vedas from starting to end but it is nowhere  
to be found such purest love that devotee shows towards God/Guru ( in the book  
Swamy referred to Saradamma's mad devotion but it is all the way same in all  
cases of true love towards God/Guru)

I dont think it is sentimentalism sir. Even if it be, even if it be  
emotional, I feel one is fortunate to get degenerated by that sentiment, by  
that emotion.   
Rather than getting stuck up with the intellectual mess, it is only good to  
shed tears of love and develop a swadheenam with a sage like Sri Ramana.

_It is not sufficient to worship Krishna, Christ or Buddha without, if there  
is not the revealing and the formation of the Buddha, the Christ or Krishna in  
ourselves_.   
Sri Aurobindo
