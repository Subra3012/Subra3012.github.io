Namaste,   
I would like to know what is the difference between these two versions of the  
Ribhu Gita: 1 - The Ribhu Gita: First English Translation from the Original Sanskrit  
Indian Epic Sivarahasya H. Ramamoorthy   
2 - Ribhu GITA, THE SIXTH OF SIVA AMSA RAHASYAM translated by Dr. Rao  
Lingeswara   
In the first there are 44 chapters and 50 chapters in the second??   
Chapter 26 of Ramamoorthy corresponds Chapter 29 of Lingeswara Rao ?   
Thank you

Dear vishnave,   
I am also puzzled about this difference. The English versification   
of Ribhu Gita by Nome and Dr. H. Ramamoorthy is based on Tamizh   
verses of Sri Ulaganatha Swamigal. This is confirmed by the translators. The  
Tamizh version is what Bhagavan Ramana was also   
quoting and recommending to others for reading. The Sanskrit-   
English edition of Sri Lingeswara Rao, has come out only in 2009.   
This is also published by Sri Ramanasramam and the foreword says   
that the Asramam people had requested Sri Lingeswara Rao [and   
Dr. Anil Sharma] to write Ribhu Gita taking the entire sixth Amsa   
of Sri Siva Rahasyam, the original Sanskrit work. Accordingly it has   
been done. Sri Lingeswara Rao is from Bhimavaram, Andhra   
Pradesh and Dr. Anil Sharma is from Arunachala Ashrama, Canada.   
This book does not explain the variation between the original   
Tamizh edition and the Sanskrit Sri Siva Rahasyam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks Subramanian.R   
The missing chapters are the first 3 and the last 3?   
What is the best translation between Sanskrit and Tamil?   
Namaste

Dear vishnave,   
I am not quite sure, about the missing chapters.   
As regards the best translation between Sanskrit and Tamizh,   
if you can understand classical Tamizh verses, you can read   
Ribhu Gita - Tamizh published by Sri Ramanasramam. The   
verses were done by one Ulaganatha Swamigal alias Bhikshu   
Sastrigal. He is the same gentleman, who has also done versification of Sri  
Sankara's Viveka Choodamani. Bhagavan   
Ramana had referred this Tamizh versification of Sri Sastrigal   
and had written the prose essay of Viveka Choodamani. This,   
He Himself acknowledges in the preface to His prose. On this   
count, one can safely refer to Ribhu Gita by Sri Sastrigal too.   
Arunachala Siva.
