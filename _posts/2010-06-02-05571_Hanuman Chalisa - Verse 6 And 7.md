**Devotee** : "Now the question is how to become acquainted with the master."  
(Laughter.)   
 **Sri Ramakrishna : "That is why I say that work is necessary. It will not do  
to say that God exists and then idle away your time. You must reach God  
somehow or other.** Call on Him in solitude and pray to Him, 'O Lord! reveal  
Thyself to me.' Weep for Him with a longing heart. **You roam about in search  
of 'woman and gold' like a madman; now be a little mad for God. **Let people  
say, 'This man has lost his head for God.' Why not renounce everything for a  
few days and call on God in solitude?   
 **" What will you achieve by simply saying that God exists and doing nothing  
about it?** There are big fish in the Haldarpukur; but can you catch them by  
merely sitting idly on the bank? Prepare some spiced bait and throw it into  
the lake. Then the fish will come from the deep water and you will see  
ripples. That will make you happy. Perhaps a fish will jump with a splash and  
you will get a glimpse of it. Then you will be so glad!   
 _" Milk must be turned to curd and the curd must be churned. Only then will  
you get butter. (To Mahima) What a nuisance! Someone must show God to a man,  
while he himself sits idly by all the while! Someone must extract the butter  
and hold it in front of his mouth! (All laugh.) What a bother! Someone else  
must catch the fish and give it to him!_   
"A man wanted to see the king. The king lived in the inner court of the  
palace, beyond seven gates. No sooner did the man pass the first gate than he  
exclaimed, 'Oh, where is the king?' But there were seven gates, and he must  
pass them one after another before he could see the king."

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri Ramakrishna on Wife interference in Spiritual life  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 02, 2010, 05:25:25 PM  
---  
**M. (to Sri Ramakrishna)** : "What should one do if one's wife says: 'You are  
neglecting me. I shall commit suicide?' "   
 **Sri Ramakrishna : (in a serious tone): "Give up such a wife if she proves  
an obstacle in the way of spiritual life. Let her commit suicide or anything  
else she likes. The wife that hampers her husband's spiritual life is an  
ungodly wife."**   
Immersed in deep thought, Sri Ramakrishna stood leaning against the wall.  
Narendra and the other devotees remained silent a few minutes. The Master  
exchanged several words with them; then, suddenly going to M., he whispered in  
his ear: "But if a man has sincere love for God, then all come under his  
control  the king, wicked persons, and his wife.   
 **Sincere love of God on the husband 's part may eventually help the wife to  
lead a spiritual life. If the husband is good, then through the grace of God  
the wife may also follow his example."**   
This had a most soothing effect on M.'s worried mind. All the while he had  
been thinking: "Let her commit suicide. What can I do?"   
M. (to Sri Ramakrishna): "This world is a terrible place indeed."   
Sri Ramakrishna (to the devotees): "That is the reason Chaitanya said to his  
companion Nityananda, 'Listen, brother, there is no hope of salvation for the  
worldly-minded.' "   
On another occasion the Sri Ramakrishna had said to M. privately: " **Yes,  
there is no hope for a worldly man if he is not sincerely devoted to God. But  
he has nothing to fear if he remains in the world after realizing God.** Nor  
need a man have any fear whatever of the world if he attains sincere devotion  
by practising spiritual discipline now and then in solitude. **Chaitanya had  
several householders among his devotees, but they were householders in name  
only, for they lived unattached to the world. "**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Nisargadatta Maharaj says dependence on anything for happiness is misery  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 02, 2010, 05:28:36 PM  
---  
Maharaj: The world is but a show, glittering and empty. It is, and yet is not.  
It is there as long as I want to see it and take part in it. When I cease  
caring, it dissolves. It has no cause and serves no purpose. It just happens  
when we are absentminded.   
It appears exactly as it looks, but there is no depth in it, nor meaning. Only  
the onlooker is real. Call him Self or Atma. **To the Self the world is but a  
colourful show, which he enjoys as long as it lasts and forgets when it is  
over.** Whatever happens on the stage makes him shudder in terror or roll with  
laughter, yet all the time he is aware that it is but a show. Without desire  
or fear he enjoys it, as it happens.   
Questioner: The person immersed in the world has a life of many flavours. He  
weeps, he laughs, loves and hates, desires and fears, suffers and rejoices.  
The desireless and fearless jnani, what life has he? Is he not left high and  
dry in his aloofness?   
M: His state is not so desolate. It tastes of the pure, uncaused, undiluted  
bliss. He is happy and fully aware that happiness is his very nature and that  
he need not do anything, nor strive for anything to secure it. It follows him,  
more real than the body, nearer than the mind itself. You imagine that without  
cause there can be no happiness. **To me dependence on anything for happiness  
is utter misery.** Pleasure and pain have causes, while my state is my own,  
totally uncaused, independent, unassailable.   
Q: We are all getting old. Old age is not pleasant -- all aches and pains,  
weakness and the approaching end. How does a jnani feel as an old man? How  
does his inner self look at his own senility.   
M: As he gets older he grows more and more happy and peaceful. After all, he  
is going home. Like a traveller nearing his destination and collecting his  
luggage, he leaves the train without regret.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Nisargadatta Maharaj says Self-awareness is the Witness  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 03, 2010, 11:09:03 AM  
---  
Q: What comes first: consciousness or awareness?   
M: Awareness becomes consciousness when it has an object. The object changes  
all the time. In consciousness there is movement; awareness by itself is  
motionless and timeless, here and now.   
Q: There is suffering and bloodshed in East Pakistan at the present moment.  
How do you look at it? How does it appear to you, how do you react to it?   
M: In pure consciousness nothing ever happens.   
Q: It is not death that I rebel against. It is the manner of dying.   
 **M: Death is natural, the manner of dying is man-made. Separateness causes  
fear and aggression, which again cause violence. Do away with man-made  
separations and all this horror of people killing each other will surely end.  
But in reality there is no killing and no dying. The real does not die, the  
unreal never lived. Set your mind right and all will be right. When you know  
that the world is one, that humanity is one, you will act accordingly. But  
first of all you must attend to the way you feel, think and live. Unless there  
is order in yourself, there can be no order in the world.**   
In reality nothing happens. Onto the screen of the mind destiny forever  
projects its pictures, memories of former projections and thus illusion  
constantly renews itself. The pictures come and go -- light intercepted by  
ignorance. See the light and disregard the picture.   
Q: I admit that the world in which I live is not the real world. But there is  
a real world, of which I see a distorted picture. The distortion may be due to  
some blemish in my body or mind. But when you say there is no real world, only  
a dream world in my mind, I just cannot take it. I wish I could believe that  
all horrors of existence are due to my having a body. Suicide would be the way  
out.   
M: As long as you pay attention to ideas, your own or of others, you will be  
in trouble. But if you disregard all teachings, all books, anything out into  
words and dive deeply within yourself and find yourself, this alone will solve  
all your problems and leave you in full mastery of every situation, because  
you will not be dominated by your ideas about the situation. Take an example.  
You are in the company of an attractive woman. You get ideas about her and  
this creates a sexual situation. A problem is created and you start looking  
for books on continence, or enjoyment. Were you a baby, both of you could be  
naked and together without any problem arising. **Just stop thinking you are  
the bodies and the problems of love and sex will lose their meaning. With all  
sense of limitation gone,fear, pain and the search for pleasure -- all cease.  
Only awareness remains.**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Nisargadatta Maharaj says Give up All and You Gain All  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 03, 2010, 11:21:21 AM  
---  
Q: Your particular existence and my particular existence, do they both exist  
in the mind of Brahma?   
M: The universal is not aware of the particular. The existence as a person is  
a personal matter. A person exists in time and space, has name and shape,  
beginning and end; the universal includes all persons and the absolute is at  
the root of and beyond all.   
Q: Surely there must be something in common between the many points of  
consciousness we are.   
M: Where are the many points? In your mind. You insist that your world is  
independent of your mind. How can it be? Your desire to know other people's  
minds is due to your not knowing your own mind. **First know your own mind and  
you will find that the question of other minds does not arise at all, for  
there are no other people.** You are the common factor, the only link between  
the minds. Being is consciousness; 'I am' applies to all.   
Q: There are affections in the dream which seem real and everlasting. Do they  
disappear on waking up?   
M: In dream you love some and not others. On waking up you find you are love  
itself, embracing all. Personal love, however intense and genuine, invariably  
binds; love in freedom is love of all.   
Q: So there is no way to gain detachment?   
 **M: There is nothing to gain. Abandon all imaginings and know yourself as  
you are. Self-knowledge is detachment.** All craving is due to a sense of  
insufficiency. When you know that you lack nothing, that all there is, is you  
and yours, desire ceases.   
Q: To know myself must I practise awareness?   
 **M: There is nothing to practise. To know yourself, be yourself. To be  
yourself, stop imagining yourself to be this or that. Just be. Let your true  
nature emerge. Don 't disturb your mind with seeking.**   
Q: It will take much time if I Just wait for self-realisation.   
M: What have you to wait for when it is already here and now? You have only to  
look and see. Look at your self, at your own being. You know that you are and  
you like it. Abandon all imagining, that is all. Do not rely on time. Time is  
death. Who waits -- dies. Life is now only. Do not talk to me about past and  
future -- they exist only in your mind.   
Q: How can I find peace when the world suffers?   
 **M: The world suffers for very valid reasons. If you want to help the world,  
you must be beyond the need of help.** Then all your doing as well as not  
doing will help the world most effectively.   
Q: How can non-action be of use where action is needed?   
M: Where action is needed, action happens. Man is not the actor. His is to be  
aware of what is going on. His very presence is action. The window is the  
absence of the wall and it gives air and light because it is empty. Be empty  
of all mental content, of all imagination and effort, and the very absence of  
obstacles will cause reality to rush in. If you really want to help a person,  
keep away. If you are emotionally committed to helping, you will fail to help.  
You may be very busy and be very pleased with your charitable nature, but not  
much will be done. A man is really helped when he is no longer in need of  
help. All else is just futility.   
Q: There is not enough time to sit and wait for help to happen. One must do  
something.   
M: By all means -- do. But what you can do is limited; the self alone is  
unlimited. Give limitlessly -- of yourself. All else you can give in small  
measures only. You alone are immeasurable. To help is your very nature. Even  
when you eat and drink you help your body. For yourself you need nothing. You  
are pure giving, beginning-less, endless, inexhaustible. When you see sorrow  
and suffering, be with it. Do not rush into activity. Neither learning nor  
action can really help. Be with sorrow and lay bare its roots -- helping to  
understand is real help.   
Q: My death is nearing.   
M: Your body is short of time, not you. Time and space are in the mind only.  
You are not bound. Just understand yourself -- that itself is eternity.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda says Vedanta alone can become the universal religion of man  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 03, 2010, 11:13:35 AM  
---  
**THE MISSION OF THE VEDANTA Volume 3, Lectures from Colombo to Almora**   
 **In other countries religion is only one of the many necessities in life.**  
To use a common illustration which I am in the habit of using, my lady has  
many things in her parlour, and it is the fashion nowadays to have a Japanese  
vase, and she must procure it; it does not look well to be without it. So my  
lady, or my gentleman, has many other occupations in life, and also a little  
bit of religion must come in to complete it. Consequently he or she has a  
little religion. **Politics, social improvement, in one word, this world, is  
the goal of mankind in the West, and God and religion come in quietly as  
helpers to attain that goal.**   
 **Ours is the true religion because it teaches that God alone is true, that  
this world is false and fleeting, that all your gold is but as dust, that all  
your power is finite, and that life itself is oftentimes an evil; therefore it  
is, that ours is the true religion.** Ours is the true religion because, above  
all, it teaches renunciation and stands up with the wisdom of ages to tell and  
to declare to the nations who are mere children of yesterday in comparison  
with us Hindus  who own the hoary antiquity of the wisdom, discovered by our  
ancestors here in India  to tell them in plain words: " **Children, you are  
slaves of the senses; there is only finiteness in the senses, there is only  
ruination in the senses; the three short days of luxury here bring only ruin  
at last. Give it all up, renounce the love of the senses and of the world;  
that is the way of religion. " Through renunciation is the way to the goal and  
not through enjoyment. Therefore ours is the only true religion**.   
I have become used to hear all sorts of wonderful claims put forward in favour  
of every religion under the sun. You have also heard, quite within recent  
times, the claims put forward by **Dr. Barrows, a great friend of mine, that  
Christianity is the only universal religion. Let me consider this question  
awhile and lay before you my reasons why I think that it is Vedanta, and  
Vedanta alone that can become the universal religion of man, and that no other  
is fitted for the role.** Excepting our own almost all the other great  
religions in the world are inevitably connected with the life or lives of one  
or more of their founders.   
Have faith in yourselves, and stand up on that faith and be strong; that is  
what we need. Why is it that we three hundred and thirty millions of people  
have been ruled for the last one thousand years by any and every handful of  
foreigners who chose to walk over our prostrate bodies? Because they had faith  
in themselves and we had not. What did I learn in the West, and what did I see  
behind those frothy sayings of the Christian sects repeating that man was a  
fallen and hopelessly fallen sinner? **There I saw that inside the national  
hearts of both Europe and America reside the tremendous power of the men 's  
faith in themselves.**   
Ay, my friends, I must tell you a few harsh truths. I read in the newspaper  
how, when one of our fellows is murdered or ill-treated by an Englishman,  
howls go up all over the country; I read and I weep, and the next moment comes  
to my mind the question: Who is responsible for it all? As a Vedantist I  
cannot but put that question to myself. The Hindu is a man of introspection;  
he wants to see things in and through himself, through the subjective vision.  
I, therefore, ask myself: Who is responsible? And the answer comes every time: Not the English; no, they are not responsible; **it is we who are responsible  
for all our misery and all our degradation, and we alone are responsible.**   
Teach yourselves, teach every one his real nature, call upon the sleeping soul  
and see how it awakes. Power will come, glory will come, goodness will come,  
purity will come, and everything that is excellent will come when this  
sleeping soul is roused to self-conscious activity. Ay, if there is anything  
in the Gita that I like, it is these two verses, coming out strong as the very  
gist, the very essence, of Krishna's teaching  " **He who sees the Supreme  
Lord dwelling alike in all beings, the Imperishable in things that perish, he  
sees indeed. For seeing the Lord as the same, everywhere present, he does not  
destroy the Self by the Self, and thus he goes to the highest goal.** "   
If the Brahmin is he who has killed all selfishness and who lives and works to  
acquire and propagate wisdom and the power of love  **if a country is  
altogether inhabited by such Brahmins, by men and women who are spiritual and  
moral and good, is it strange to think of that country as being above and  
beyond all law? What police, what military are necessary to govern them? Why  
should any one govern them at all? Why should they live under a government?  
They are good and noble, and they are the men of God; these are our ideal  
Brahmins, and we read that in the Satya Yuga there was only one caste, and  
that was the Brahmin.** We read in the Mahâbhârata that the whole world was in  
the beginning peopled with Brahmins, and that as they began to degenerate,  
they became divided into different castes, and that when the cycle turns  
round, they will all go back to that Brahminical origin. This cycle is turning  
round now, and I draw your attention to this fact.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Nisargadatta Maharaj says Give up All and You Gain All  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 03, 2010, 11:21:21 AM  
---  
Q: Your particular existence and my particular existence, do they both exist  
in the mind of Brahma?   
M: The universal is not aware of the particular. The existence as a person is  
a personal matter. A person exists in time and space, has name and shape,  
beginning and end; the universal includes all persons and the absolute is at  
the root of and beyond all.   
Q: Surely there must be something in common between the many points of  
consciousness we are.   
M: Where are the many points? In your mind. You insist that your world is  
independent of your mind. How can it be? Your desire to know other people's  
minds is due to your not knowing your own mind. **First know your own mind and  
you will find that the question of other minds does not arise at all, for  
there are no other people.** You are the common factor, the only link between  
the minds. Being is consciousness; 'I am' applies to all.   
Q: There are affections in the dream which seem real and everlasting. Do they  
disappear on waking up?   
M: In dream you love some and not others. On waking up you find you are love  
itself, embracing all. Personal love, however intense and genuine, invariably  
binds; love in freedom is love of all.   
Q: So there is no way to gain detachment?   
 **M: There is nothing to gain. Abandon all imaginings and know yourself as  
you are. Self-knowledge is detachment.** All craving is due to a sense of  
insufficiency. When you know that you lack nothing, that all there is, is you  
and yours, desire ceases.   
Q: To know myself must I practise awareness?   
 **M: There is nothing to practise. To know yourself, be yourself. To be  
yourself, stop imagining yourself to be this or that. Just be. Let your true  
nature emerge. Don 't disturb your mind with seeking.**   
Q: It will take much time if I Just wait for self-realisation.   
M: What have you to wait for when it is already here and now? You have only to  
look and see. Look at your self, at your own being. You know that you are and  
you like it. Abandon all imagining, that is all. Do not rely on time. Time is  
death. Who waits -- dies. Life is now only. Do not talk to me about past and  
future -- they exist only in your mind.   
Q: How can I find peace when the world suffers?   
 **M: The world suffers for very valid reasons. If you want to help the world,  
you must be beyond the need of help.** Then all your doing as well as not  
doing will help the world most effectively.   
Q: How can non-action be of use where action is needed?   
M: Where action is needed, action happens. Man is not the actor. His is to be  
aware of what is going on. His very presence is action. The window is the  
absence of the wall and it gives air and light because it is empty. Be empty  
of all mental content, of all imagination and effort, and the very absence of  
obstacles will cause reality to rush in. If you really want to help a person,  
keep away. If you are emotionally committed to helping, you will fail to help.  
You may be very busy and be very pleased with your charitable nature, but not  
much will be done. A man is really helped when he is no longer in need of  
help. All else is just futility.   
Q: There is not enough time to sit and wait for help to happen. One must do  
something.   
M: By all means -- do. But what you can do is limited; the self alone is  
unlimited. Give limitlessly -- of yourself. All else you can give in small  
measures only. You alone are immeasurable. To help is your very nature. Even  
when you eat and drink you help your body. For yourself you need nothing. You  
are pure giving, beginning-less, endless, inexhaustible. When you see sorrow  
and suffering, be with it. Do not rush into activity. Neither learning nor  
action can really help. Be with sorrow and lay bare its roots -- helping to  
understand is real help.   
Q: My death is nearing.   
M: Your body is short of time, not you. Time and space are in the mind only.  
You are not bound. Just understand yourself -- that itself is eternity.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda says the gift of spirituality is the highest help  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 03, 2010, 11:26:13 AM

**MY PLAN OF CAMPAIGN (Delivered at the Victoria Hall, Madras)   
Volume 3, Lectures from Colombo to Almora**   
 **I have seen that I cannot preach even religion to Americans without showing  
them its practical effect on social life. I could not preach religion in  
England without showing the wonderful political changes the Vedanta would  
bring.** So, in India, social reform has to be preached by showing how much  
more spiritual a life the new system will bring; and politics has to be  
preached by showing how much it will improve the one thing that the nation  
wants  its spirituality. Every man has to make his own choice; so has every  
nation. We made our choice ages ago, and we must abide by it. And, after all,  
it is not such a bad choice. **Is it such a bad choice in this world to think  
not of matter but of spirit, not of man but of God? That intense faith in  
another world, that intense hatred for this world, that intense power of  
renunciation, that intense faith in God, that intense faith in the immortal  
soul, is in you.** I challenge anyone to give it up. You cannot. You may try  
to impose upon me by becoming materialists, by talking materialism for a few  
months, but I know what you are; if I take you by the hand, back you come as  
good theists as ever were born. How can you change your nature?   
 **So every improvement in India requires first of all an upheaval in  
religion.**   
Everyone must know of them, because it is said, "This has first to be heard,  
then thought upon, and then meditated upon." Let the people hear first, and  
whoever helps in making the people hear about the great truths in their own  
scriptures cannot make for himself a better Karma today. Says our Vyasa, "In  
the Kali Yuga there is one Karma left. Sacrifices and tremendous Tapasyâs are  
of no avail now. Of Karma one remains, and that is the Karma of giving." **And  
of these gifts, the gift of spirituality and spiritual knowledge is the  
highest; the next gift is the gift of secular knowledge; the next is the gift  
of life; and the fourth is the gift of food.** Look at this wonderfully  
charitable race; look at the amount of gifts that are made in this poor, poor  
country; look at the hospitality where a man can travel from the north to the  
south, having the best in the land, being treated always by everyone as if he  
were a friend, and where no beggar starves so long as there is a piece of  
bread anywhere!

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Chinmayananda  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 03, 2010, 01:40:41 PM

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinmayananda   
http://www.chinmayamission.com/   
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2059111871.cms   
H.H. Swami Chinmayananda (8 May 1916  3 August 1993), **born Balakrishna  
Menon (Balan) was an Indian spiritual leader, and teacher, who inspired the  
formation of Chinmaya Mission in 1953 to spread the message of Vedanta.**   
 **Chinmaya Mission has over 300 centers in India and the world over.**   
He was a disciple of Swami Sivananda at Rishikesh, who founded the Divine Life  
Society.   
Balakrishna Menon (Balan) was born in Ernakulam, **Kerala** in a devout Hindu  
noble family called "Poothampalli" of Makia Awwa and Kuttan Menon. Upon his  
birth, his father called for an astrologer, who stated that Balan's birth was  
an auspicious one, and that he was destined to be a king. He graduated from  
Madras University in 1939 and went on to do graduate study in English  
literature from Lucknow University.   
Swami Chinmayananda started the tradition of Gyana Yagnas, in an effort to  
spread the message of the Geeta and the Upanishads, thus the first such Geeta  
Gyan Yagna was held in Pune between December 31, 1951 and April 1952   
He founded the Chinmaya Mission in 1953 and later played an important role in  
the formation of Vishva Hindu Parishad in 1964. He became the first president  
of Vishva Hindu Parishad and served VHP in the role of a spiritual advisor  
thereafter. During his forty years of travelling and teaching, Swami  
Chinmayananda opened numerous centres and ashrams worldwide, he also built  
many schools, hospitals, nursing homes and clinics. His interest in helping  
the villagers with basic necessities lead to the eventual creation of a rural  
development project, known as the Chinmaya Organization for Rural Development  
or CORD. Its National Director, Dr. Kshama Metre was recently awarded the  
Padma Shree National award in Social Work.   
Swami Chinmayananda died on 3 August 1993 in San Diego, California, and his  
mortal remains were placed in a Samadhi on 19th August, 1993, at the Sidhbari  
Ashram in the Himalayas.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Hanuman Chalisa - Verse 6 And 7  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 02, 2010, 09:24:18 AM  
---  
**Verse 6**   
 _Kanchan varan viraj subesa   
Kanan Kundal Kunchit Kesa_   
 **Verse 7**   
 _Hath Vajra Aur Dhuvaje Viraje   
Kandhe moonj janehu sajai _   
**Verse 6 Meaning:**   
Your physique is beautiful golden coloured and your dress is pretty. You wear  
ear rings and have long curly hair.   
 **Verse 7 Meaning:**   
You carry in your hand a lightening bolt along with a victory (kesari) flag  
and wear the sacred thread on your shoulder.   
 **Commentary :**   
In Verse 7 it is mentioned that Lord Hanuman wears sacred thread.Sacred  
Threads are generally wore by brahmins.   
But guru ramana says many times who is a real brahmin.   
Bhagavan Ramana says,A brahmin is one who has realised Brahman.   
More Over In Shanti Parva of the Mahabharata it says,   
Acts alone determine who is a Brahmana and who is not. Performing all rituals  
and sacrifices does not make a Brahmana. There is only one bondage, namely,  
that caused by desire. He who is free from this bondage is a Brahmana. He who  
restrains his senses, who is constantly in yogic samadhi is a Brahmana: he is  
distinguished above all others, and derives his joys from the Self alone.  
**(Shanti Parva of the Mahabharata)**   
Yet the Brahmins as a caste have done a lot of good to India and to the world  
by saving the Shastras from destruction, through staunch adherence to  
tradition.   
Swami Vivekananda says,   
 **It is the duty of the Brahmin, therefore, to work for the salvation of the  
rest of mankind in India. If he does that, and so long as he does that, he is  
a Brahmin, but he is no Brahmin when he goes about making money.**   
He only is the Brahmin who has no secular employment. Secular employment is  
not for the Brahmin but for the other castes. To the Brahmins I appeal, that  
they must work hard to raise the Indian people by teaching them what they  
know, by giving out the culture that they have accumulated for centuries.

There is a Tv. serial i.e. called where is brahmin. Very interesting. It is  
written by Cho. Ramaswami who himself is a brahmin. The title is ENGE  
BRAHMANAN. In the way it is good to know atleast to be called brahmin we  
should follow particular systems. But it is very difficult to live in these  
kali yuga as it is said in varnasrama. There are very few one or two villages  
where only brahmins are living and following daily Agni hotram. It is not  
enough to observe the rules of brahmin tradition but also very important to be  
brahman himself always. But most people live for money in this kali yuga as a  
brahmin.

Dear prasanth/Ramanaduli,   
Yes. No one can live as a true Brahmin as propounded by   
Vedas. The minimum things that one can do is to do Sandhya   
Vandhanam or at least Gayatri mantra, along with exhibiting   
other qualities of not being greedy, not needing too many fashionable   
clothes, jewels and also no harming any other living beings. Agnihotram and  
Oupasanam are more difficult to perform daily.   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian garu and ramanaduli garu,   
What you say is correct.   
These days it is becoming hard to find true brahmins.   
i know few brahmins   
a) who drink alcohol and smoke cigarates.   
b) who eat non-vegetarian happily with no concern.   
c) who cheated few girls in name of love/marriage and happily married another  
girl   
d) who are atheists   
e) fake sanyasis   
f) few temple priests who demand money by asking you to tell your gotram etc (  
This is not really their fault as their salaries are very less and so they  
came down to this level)   
g) in tirupati one priest stole one goddess gold idol and with help of that he  
has done his daughter marriage. ( This is not really their fault completely as  
their salaries are very less and so they came down to this level)   
h) there are many brahmin hero/heroines who do all kind of stupid things in  
movies and earn illegal money.   
list will be endless sir...   
What to do ??
