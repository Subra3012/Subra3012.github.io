**The Maha-Svami and The Maharishi**   
Ra. Ganapati   
Two reports I heard from the servitors of the Maha-Svami relating him to  
Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharishi I could myself easily attribute to their  
creative artistry in elevating their own Master over every other holy man. Yet  
I wanted to get confirmation from His Holiness himself for certain reasons.   
The Maha-Svami, ever bubbling with wit and witticism had a unique way of  
saying things. He said he did not want to give the same judgment on both  
reports and so would call one of them as pettal (colloquial for pitatral) and  
the other as ularal. The fun of it si that both the words mean the same, viz.,  
talking nonsense!   
To come to the two reports. One of them was that when the Maha-Svami was  
circumambulating the Holy Hill during his camp at Tiruvannamalai, Sri Ramana  
Maharishi purposely came out of his living room in the Ramana-Asrama and  
walked to a particular spot from where he could see the Maha-Svami at a  
distance.   
Even as I heard it I could write it off, because Maharishi was to me surely  
one to whom the triad of the seer, seen and sight had dissolved in the oneness  
of the only Self. (So it was to His Holiness. But he donned the role of the  
Teacher exemplifying the ideal to the humans, and therefore was ever on the  
move to see people and holy places.)   
Decades back, a lad of sixteen, the Maharishi fled home to Tirvannamalai,  
afire with the raging ardor to see the Fire-Linga of lord Arunachalesvara. He  
took darsan, just one darsan, and with that the very idea of an object to be  
seen apart from the self was burnt out! Though he lived in the very temple  
precincts for the next five or six months, he did not visit the sanctum  
sanctorum again. To assert that, contrary to what the Asrama sources say, he  
did come out to see that Maha-Svami is, as the Svami himself said, nothing but  
pettal (nonsense).   
Our Acharya Maha-Svami visited Tiruvannamalai twice, once in 1929 and again in  
1944, both for the Kartika Deepam festival (when the holy beacon is lighted  
atop the Hill). On both the occasions he also made the customary Giri-  
pradakshinam (circumambulation of the Hill). The Ramanasraman lies on the  
route. I have heard reports from two very reliable and respected persons  
attached to the Asramam, Sri Kunju Svamigal and Mme. Suri Nagmma about what  
transpired when the Maha-Svami passed along the route. Kunju Svami must have  
been present on both the occasions and Nagamma on the latter one.   
Bhagavan had already prepared the asramites not to take it amiss if the  
Acharya did not enter into the Asramam and see him; because, according to one  
tradition, one in the Jagadguru Peetham (Seat of the World-teacher) must not  
call on another holy man on his own. As for himself, though he did not say it,  
he would not extend an invitation to anyone for the simple reason that he did  
not have any desire or need to see any body, anything. As for the asramites,  
they could, if they so wished, gather outside and have darsan of the Acharya  
as he moved along.   
And most of them did.   
The asramites had great respect for the Acharya, especially by the forties,  
because it was he who almost compelled Paul Brunton the Maharishi's feet, and  
it was Brunton's soulful account of the Maharishi that threw open the window  
of the West of the light of the Illumined Master. The book clearly shows that  
the Acharya considered the Maharishi as "a high master" who can give  
"initiation into the real yoga of the higher kind".   
In one of his discourses in Madras in the early thirties, the Acharya had  
raked the Maharishi, whom he referred to as Ramana Svamigal, among the jivan-  
muktas (liberated even while living in a body). The asramites were naturally  
happy that the respected head of a Sankara Math, uncompromising in such  
matters, gave such praise to the Maharishi in public.   
On both the occasions of his visit to Tiruvanna malai, the Acharya turned his  
eyes towards the entrance of the Asrama, stopped for a few seconds looking  
round and continued to walk, a still picture in motion!   
Reminiscing the second visit Nagamma said, while all the other asramites went  
out and waited at the gate for His Holiness, she alone was left with the  
Maharishi.   
"Why have you not joined them?" he asked her.   
"Because the Svami does not see Brahmin widows who have not shaved their  
heads", Nagamma replied.   
Though mature and tolerant not to denounce the orthodox custom, she felt a  
tinge of sadness.   
The Maharishi just nodded his head and looked at her with compassion, The  
compassion assuaged her sadness. The simple nod too conveyed a lot to the  
discerning disciple. It signified the Maharishi's acceptance of both the  
Acharya's adherence to the institutional customs, and Nagamma's wisdom in not  
following the other such windows who used to peep at the Acharya from a hidden  
place.   
Here comes something antipodal between the Maha-Svami and the Maharishi. the  
former stood foremost in strictly observing all the distinction laid out by  
the Dharma sastras and orthodox traditions, whereas the latter stood foremost  
in practicing equality. Even to merit the glance of the Maha-Svami one had to  
fulfil conditions; a millionaires Brahmin widow was disqualified if she was  
not tonsured! On the other hand, even an untouchable beggar could sit right by  
the side of the Maharishi and eat along with him. Nay, if he so felt, there  
was no restriction to his feeding the Maharishi from out of the alms in his  
begging bowl! How rude, crude and cruel does the one appear and how suave,  
soft and sweet the other? How is it that the Sweet gives his nod of approval  
to the Cruel?   
If the Sweet cannot appreciate the Cruel, equally true is the vice versa. But  
whereas the Sweet's appreciation of the Cruel came out in `just nodding,' the  
Cruel's appreciation of the Sweet came out in a verbal flow. That was in the  
public discourse given by the Maha-Svami the very night. To quote Nagamma,  
"The Swami spoke at great length saying that every head of a religious  
organisation has to observe established traditions while one who is an  
Athyasramite (one transcending the four stages of life prescribed by the  
Dharma Sastras) has no such inhibitions... (To) attain that state is very  
difficult and that had been possible only for a great soul like Ramana  
Maharishi."   
The devotees of the Maharishi exulted at this unstinted tribute the Acharya  
paid to their Master in their home-town.   
But close on it wake the Acharya gave a rude shock to them. They felt that he  
had dealt a direct blow on what they held in worshipful respect in the Asrama,  
viz., the temple over the spot where the body of the mother of the Maharishi  
was buried. When she passed away, the Maharishi favoured the idea of putting  
up such a structure because in his view (which was not just a view, but  
perception of truth) she was a Sannyasini who attained the Jnani's liberation  
of Oneness. Vedic priests offered their chants and ritualistic services at the  
temple as they did in any other `regular' temple. But, to their dismay when  
they went after one such service there to participate in the evening Puja at  
the Acharya's Math, they were asked to enter only after taking a purificatory  
bath. Because, first of all opinion was divided among the orthodoxy on first  
of all, opinion was divided among the orthodoxy on the very question of the  
eligibility of women for sannyasa; and even if that was accepted, the mother  
of Maharishi was not initiated to that order in the formal, scriptural way. So  
the place of her burial was just a grave-yard (which pollutes the entrants).   
The directive of the Acharya to the priests struck the asramites as a bigoted,  
book-learnt judgement over the intuitive judgment of their enlightened master.  
As most of the priests were also devoted to the Maharishi, they were deeply  
perturbed when the Pontiff, who was the bulwark of the priestly tradition in  
the changing world, pronounced the stricture.   
Early next morning the asramites and priests went to the Maharishi. In spite  
of the asramites' efforts to restrain themselves before their august Master,  
they could not keep their tempers. They complained about what all `that Svami'  
was doing with his differentiating outlook in contrast to what `this Bhagavan'  
was doing in his all-embracing outlook. "The priests want to give a reply to  
him. (They actually wanted to teach him a lesson!) Bhagavan should give the  
reply."   
As ever unruffled, the Maharishi heard it all and in his stately composure  
gave his judgement on the judgement of the Svami on his previous judgment. It  
was Neutrality itself that spoke!   
"Why say that person, this person? Say there, here. That is the correct  
expression. Viewed so, what all has happened will also be understood as  
correct. (For the benefit of the Tamil-knowing readers, let me give the  
original simple, concise and powerful words of the Maharishi as faithfully  
conveyed by Sri Kunju Svami: That is an orthodox Peetham, and this an  
independent ashram. Who ever is here would be like this. So long as that svami  
is the head of that Peetham he must only follow (more precisely,  
`demonstrate', because the Maharishi said not the ways and rules of the  
Peetham. He had therefore issued that directive.   
"Why reply? Then there will be a counter to it, a counter to the counter and  
it will go on like that. (Looking at the asramites) Let us carry on in our way  
silently here, come. The others may withdraw. let not anybody raise questions  
and arguments."   
Is it not clear that Maharishi considered the Maha-svami to be a Brahma-jnani  
in reality who was just `demonstrating' certain ways because he happened to be  
in a certain place! The Brahma-jnani alone can take the colour of any  
surroundings. Chameleon-like? But the chameleon does that to save itself; the  
jnani, to save the surrounding! The particular surrounding of our Brahma-jnani  
conferred on him the uniqueness of being the only Maha-Purusha of the recent  
times to apparently bind his state of unbound freedom with shackles of the  
strictest codes of the orthodox tradition. Much in it would be rude, crude and  
cruel in the eyes of the changing free world. But in Nature's order freedom  
too must be balanced by discipline, which is another name for restraint. When  
almost the whole world plumbed in for freedom and its consequent break from  
the past to its rude, crude and cruel extreme, it was as though Nature threw  
up the Single Entity on the Acharya to counter balance it by his total  
adherence to the past tradition in its extreme form. Though noble motives and  
ideals are not lacking n the Modern Movements, in actually it has only `helped  
its adherents in self-pampering in various ways. In contrast, however base  
orthodoxy appeared to be, people saw with open eyes in its Ace-adherent the  
living example of self-paupering. They realised that he was more `cruel' in  
his self-denial than in denying them the many rights they clamoured for. It  
was the power of this self-abnegation, added to that of his unbounded love  
deep within, which knew no differentiation, that gained universal respect for  
him.   
But human nature being what it is, respect gives way to remonstration when  
personally picked. That happened with the Ramana-asramites too. But the  
Maharishi, who had no person to be pricked, dissolved it by counseling  
sympathetic acceptance.

## Re:[1]Topic:  The Maha-Svami and The Maharishi  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: October 10, 2016, 10:38:09 AM

Contd.,   
These are various systems of medicine. In the Unani system we have sweet and  
soft drugs, in the Ayurveda bitter and pungent ones. Does that mean the hakim  
only is kind an the vaidya cruel? Whatever the patient may think, the hakim  
and vaidya, if open-hearted, will acknowledge the merit of each other. That  
was what our vaidya Maha-Swami and hakim Maharishi did. That was the secret of  
the mutual appreciation between the `Cruel' and the `Sweet'.   
(It is also generally accepted by the Masters that when we are in the initial  
stages of cleansing the mind the Ayurveda of (the Karma-marga of) the Dharma  
Sastras is more called or, and only afterwards the Unani of Jnana Marga.)   
According to my sure understanding, the orthodox interpretation the Maha-Svami  
gave of touching the place of burial of Maharishi's mother must have changed  
later on.   
For nearly a decade from the early seventies I often felt an irresistible urge  
to visit Ramanasrama. At that time I had asked the Maha-svami about my going  
to what was said to be the Mother's temple there.   
He said with a smile, "I think you say `what is said to be' because you have  
heard about my pronouncement (uttravu) on that", he continued, "That was  
before the Kumbhabishekam (formal consecration of the structure as a temple)  
was performed there quite elaborately. Among the many santi karmas (expiatory  
rites) in that, what was necessary in the particular matter was also carried  
out, perhaps without the knowledge of the people of the Asramam themselves."   
Though this may appear rather scrappy to the readers, the eloquent sannidhya  
(divine personal radiation) of the Maha-Svami added to his verbal statement  
gave me, personally, the full answer. I could construe with certainty that by  
`what was necessary in this particular matter was carried out' he meant tat  
what was scripturally ordained for conferring the status of a temple to a  
structure that had come up in a burial ground was carried into effect.  
"Perhaps without the knowledge of the people of the Asramam themselves": my  
sure guess is that somebody on behalf of the priests to perform the  
Kumbhabishekam, evidently having in mind the Maha-Svami's previous stricture,  
had independently sought his advice before taking up the consecration and the  
Maha-svami must have told him to see if any rite to formally authorise a  
temple that had come up in a graveyard was given in the Sastras, and if found,  
that must be carried out in the present case. Actually finding some such, the  
priests must have duly fulfilled that. Not a raise any unpleasant thoughts  
among the asramites, the Maha Svami must have, in his abounding sympathy,  
advised the priests to keep this back from them.   
Apart from this `sure guess', it is a fact that the Maha-Svami permitted me,  
who may be said to be on the side of the orthodox, to visit the place as a  
temple. That applies to all others of the same persuasion.   
Deep within, the sweet water and tender pulp of love and compassion, but on  
the outside, the hard shell and the husky rind of the orthodox cannons and  
customs such a coconut the Acharya was. If we acknowledge that he did also  
partake of the dualism of the world in this Avataric semblance to humanity, we  
will realise that his loving heart would have undergone more pain than the  
`victims' of his stringent strictures - as in the present had to veto the  
verdict of the very person whom he respected as the perfect example of non-  
dual perfection. Who knows the number of times something akin to the episode  
of Sri Rama banishing his beloved and spotless Sita for the sake of upholding  
his dharmic duty happened in the life of the Acharya! The imperceptible  
influence of this spirit of sacrifice enhanced the unexceptional respect he  
elicited.   
We come to the second of the reports, the ularal one.   
What the whole world came to know as the unique `aspect' of the Maharishi was  
his total indifference to whatsoever happened to the body. Even in his teens  
he was thoroughly obvious of the worms and insects eating into his thighs and  
nates when he was absorbed in the Self in a subterranean cavern. When at the  
end of his life, sarcoma was perforating his arm, the world wondered at his  
perfect unconcern over it. But my Math friends belonged to a different world,  
the world of the Maha Svami's one-up manship over all other holymen! So their  
Maharishi sent word to their Maha-Svami about his protracted suffering, asking  
why it should be so. (Thank God the friends did not go to the extent of saying  
that the Maharishi prayed for the Maha-Svami's grace for relief) the Maha-  
Svami in return sent the message, "It is will known to you that the body is  
not you. (It was gracious of the friends to accept this!) Then what is there  
except keeping on to it?"   
Even as I heard it, it struck me as stark absurd. But when I saw even  
knowledgeable people believing in it, I took the matter t the Maha-Svami's  
ears.   
And he just dismissed it as ularal.   
He went on, brimming with his admiration for the Maharishi. "We have read in  
the books about the Atma Nishthas (those absorbed in the Self), Braha-Jnanis  
(knowers of Brahman) and Jivan-Muktas (those liberated even while living in  
the body), to whom the existence and extinction of the body made no difference  
and who, fully one (with the Self) did not have an inkling of desire to see or  
hear anything. Ramana Rishi was among the few extra-ordinary (apurva) persons  
of the recent times who have demonstrated all that as true. He is the one who  
has brought, for the world to see, the hoary Jnani-tradition down to the  
present day."   
"Authentic saint?" I said, partly in the affirmative, partly as a question.   
"And a jnani at that. Authentic jnani" he amended.   
(Many, perhaps most, of the saints do not have the non-dual realisation of the  
jnani.)   
On another occasion the Maha-Svami said that it was a matter of pride for us  
(of Tamilnadu) that such one as Ramana Rishi lived among us in the present  
(degenerate) day. This was in private.   
But there was a public occasion when he lauded the Maharishi's spiritual power  
in a moving way in his staggering humility. That was at the farewell gathering  
at the end of his eighteen-month-long stay in Madras, from Sep. 1957 to March  
1959. He said that though he moved from place to place and lived in the midst  
of the people them back to the sastraic way of life. In contrast, he cited the  
Maharishi and Sri Aurobindo who did not move out of their asramas and yet drew  
even foreigners to their respective paths.   
But there is a world of difference here. Whereas the Maha-Svami's path of the  
Dharma Sastras is for the world at large, the Maharishi's Jnana and Sri  
Aurobindo's Yoga are only for the little minority with the required competence  
and inclination. Such people also have the antenna to discover their master  
even if they live in the distant corner of the world, and also the diligence  
to steadfastly follow the master's path to the end. But the masses are very  
hard to reclaim, and the more so, to a path to which they are not attracted by  
native choice.   
Though in his humility Maha-Svami under-rated his influence, we must  
underscore the fact that he too had turned many a mod and agnostic to the  
sastraic path, sometimes even in a instant. Not only that. He has turned many  
to the paths of Jnana and Yoga too. Especially in the last decades of his life  
his influence spread the world over and drew considerable number of foreigners  
to the paths of Jnana and Yoga, which included the initiates of Paul Brunton  
himself.   
It did not end up with the mutual esteem each had for the other. Higher above  
each has unmistakably indicated his very identify with the other.   
Smt. Kanakamma was born in a family deeply attached to the Kanchi Math and its  
Acharya. But she took to the Maharishi with fervour. Her relatives were  
against it. Her grand-mother took her to the Acharya, made the complaint and  
petitioned to him to wean her from the Maharishi and take her into his fold.   
Pat, yet soft, came his reply: "What if it is here or there?'   
The judgement from their very Court silenced the members of the family.   
We saw before the Maharishi saying that the different prescriptions were due  
only to the two places and not to the two persons. Even there, the perceptive  
reader would have heard in undertone a hint to the non-difference between the  
two persons. Now, when the Maha-Svami referred by `here' and `there' not the  
two places, but the two persons, we have a more audible indication of their  
non-differences. We are blessed to have a more explicit expression of this  
identity from the lips of the Maharishi. I quote from Sri. G.V. Subbaramayya*: Jagadguru Sri Sankaracharya of Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham was now (end of Oct.  
1947) camping near Tiruvannamalai. Someone asked whether His Holiness and Sri  
Bhagavan ever met. Sri Bhagavan replied: "When were we separate that we should not meet? We are always together."   
Actually, `togetherness' was only `oneness to that Advaita Jnani.   
Their unity in the sublimity of Advaita may be out of our comprehension. Both  
are identical in their utter simplicity born of that very sublimity. Her we  
can certainly understand, admire and adore the oneness of the Maha-Svami and  
the Maharishi and exclaim "O sancta simplicitas ! (O holy simplicity!)"   
\*

I asked them the way to Bhagavan's place of residence. Seeing exhaustion writ   
all over my face and hearing my Malayalam accented Tamizh, they said in a   
sympathetic tone, 'Poor chap! You are exhausted. Take a dip in this tank and  
proceed   
up this path and you will reach Bhagavan's place (Skandasramam). Remain there.   
We will be bringing food which we will share with you.' Accordingly, I had my  
bath   
and was cleansed of all the muck inside and gain purity and gain inner purity,  
so I sped up, even as a calf fondly rushes headlong towards its mother cow.   
Darshan of Sadguru: While on my way up I began formulating mentally, the manner of saluting   
and the mode of my general behavior while in the presence of the Guru.   
I resolved that the very first words that the Master addresses to me, I shall   
take as His upadesa. Reaching Skandasramam, I stood enthralled at the sight   
of Bhagavan. At that moment, my friend Ramakrishna Swami, Perumal Swami   
and Akandananda -- all three were prostrate before Bhagavan. Needless to   
say, I joined them in salutation.   
Ramakrishna Swami was surprised and happy to see me. He at once introduced   
me to Bhagavan, saying, 'This man comes from my place, where he has been   
been following an ascetic discipline since childhood.' Bhagavan looked at me  
nodding   
His head in approval. Asking me to remain there, the other two left. Later,   
I learnt that they had gone down to bury one Annamalai Swam of Arani town,   
who had been serving Bhagavan and had died of plague.   
I could hear sounds of weeping from an inner room. I turned to see a grief  
stricken   
old lady saying amidst her cries, 'Alas! This gem of a boy Annamalai Swami   
is now gone! What cruel injustice!' Some one was siting near her. Bhagavan   
turned towards them and said, by way of consolation, 'Why do you grieve?   
Another young man has now come to fill his absence.' At that time, I could  
not   
understand the significance of those words, but could only much, much later.   
I learnt that the lady inside was none other than Azhagamma, Bhagavan's mother   
and the other one was His brother, Niranjananda Swami.   
It was now 8 am., when Ramalingam Pillai, known popularly as Pinnalur  
Turiyanandan   
called me near and handed me a bowl made of baked clay. Himself taking one,   
he sat down to eat along with me, under a naaval tree (jambolna). Bhagavan   
sat on a raised platform nearby, with a bowl in front of Him. Venu Ammal,  
sister   
of Echammal who had been offering cooked food to Bhagavan everyday, served   
us rice and rasam (pepper soup). And we had our repast.

The Guru's Behests Are His Upadesa: Sometime passed. Bhagavan and I were now together, alone, but He did not say   
anything to me. I just knew that this was an important moment in my spiritual   
instruction. He took a scoop of flour in a ladle from out of a small tin  
container near   
Him, transferred into a cooking utensil, added water to it from His kamadalam,   
then placed the utensil on the charcoal brazier next to Him, which was then  
doing duty as my room warmer. Watching silently I waited, imagining it to be  
some concoction of a body tonic, and hopeful of being served a helping.   
Bhagavan kept stirring the contents until it was cooked to a gruel-like  
consistency,   
then too the vessel off the fire. He poured some of its contents on to a  
plate,   
and then rose and lifted a basket that was kept upside down. From underneath,   
four tiny puppies came springing out and rushed towards the plate, trying to  
lick   
the gruel down. Lest the hot gruel should burn their tongue, Bhagavan tried  
to restrain them but could not succeed.   
Bhagavan, who had until not uttered a word to me, said, 'Hold all the four  
on!'   
I at once grabbed the four puppies. As the meal cooled down, He said, 'Let go   
one by one.' As I had earlier determined to seek the deeper meaning of His  
words,   
I took His first command to mean, 'Hold on to the four Mahavakyas! That would  
be   
my Master's very first spiritual instruction. I took His second bidding to  
mean that   
I took His second bidding to mean that I should give up all attachments. I let  
go   
of the puppies, one by one. They lapped up their meal, and with bellies  
filled,   
tottered when one of them urinated. Getting up at once, Bhagavan poured some   
water over the mess and wiped the spot clean with a rag of gunny sack.   
I became restless wanting to do the cleaning myself but controlled the urge,   
not daring to do something unbidden. Bhagavan returned to His seat.   
Now it was another one's turn to urinate. Seeing my quandary, Bhagavan   
said, 'Wipe it clean!' I rose up and washed it with clean water. I took up  
His third   
'commandment' to mean, 'Cleanse your mind and keep it spotless. These   
'commandments' of Bhagavan gave me a pervading feeling of peace and joy.   
contd.,

Part Two of Reminscences: I pray for Grace and Receive Upadesa: Bhagavan was resting seated. An opportune moment for conversing with Him in   
private, I narrated to Him to everything \- my childhood, my stint of  
delivering   
discourses in Japa, listening to Vedanta discourses as desired by my father,  
the period   
of my mental turmoil trying to discover spiritual peace, and relief from the  
turmoil   
trying to discover spiritual peace, and relief from turmoil and experiencing  
Shanti the   
moment I heard about Bhagavan, my Vedanta Master's jiva samadhi misadventure  
--   
I blurted out all in my native tongue, Malayalam. Bhagavan listened smiling  
all through. I then asked Him for a way of the muddle in my mind towards  
mental   
quietude.   
Bhagavan said, 'Well, you have read Kaivalyam, wherein it is said, If he (the  
aspirant   
comes to see the individual self and its substratum, the Overself, then he  
becomes   
the substratum, i.e, Brahman, and escapes rebirths. Should you know yourself,.   
no harm will befall you. Accordingly, once you know yourself, you will come  
to no harm.'   
I then asked Him how to get this Self Knowledge, and He replied 'First find  
out   
who you are.'   
'How?' I persisted.   
'See from where the thoughts arise.'   
'How do I go about it?'   
'Turn the mind inwards and merge in your heart', He concluded,   
and fall back to His natural, silent peace. I too sat, silent. Bhagavan's   
compassion filled gaze was fixed on me. That moment, the muddle cleared   
and I experienced a mental calm and contentment that I had never before   
felt.   
contd.   
Arunachala Siva.

Reproached for Insensitivity: A devotee by name Ramanatha Brahmachari, stricken with plague, lay bedridden   
in the other wing of Skandasramam. He was in pain as the eruptions on his skin   
had burst open. I shall now recount what took place a week before my coming  
to   
Bhagavan, when the infection started.   
Asking Ramanatha to rest, Bhagavan started from Skandasramam on giri  
pradakshina, accompanied by Perumal Swami, Rangaswamy Iyengar and others.  
They rested a while at Pachai Amman temple en route when the the put forward a   
proposal to Bhagavan. They said, 'Ramanatha's disease being contagious, we can  
all   
remain stationed here, carrying food to him at meal time and tending to remain   
during those visits.' Bhagavan shot back, 'Ah! What a splendid idea! He  
came here   
to me when he was a mere boy and is solely dependent on us. Is it fair to  
stay here   
leaving him all alone in his present condition? If you are afraid of catching  
an infection you all remain here. I will go and be with him. Enough if you  
bring me food   
while bringing his.' Stung with remorse at this retort they hung their heads.   
Celebrating My (re) Birth Day: Annamalai Swami who was buried on the day of my arrival, had composed a  
hundred verses on Bhagavan. Each year, on the anniversary of his demise, his  
brother and friends would arrive from Arni and perform Puja at his samadhi.  
They would then come to the Asramam and chant those hundred verses of his, and  
join the special   
Bhiksha organized that day in his remembrance. This practice continued for  
several   
years. It was a particularly special occasion to me because it was my first  
darshan   
of Bhagavan, and indeed was the day I was born anew. I used to look upon those  
death anniversary meal offerings as my birthday feast.

The Glory of the Presence: I remain inundated in the bliss of Bhagavan's presence. Eighteen days went by   
in this bliss. Bhagavan's potent presence kept me in abidance in the very  
core of   
my heart. An idea struck me" 'Well! I am now stabilized in this state.  
Here in   
Tiruvannamalai, my mental composure is disrupted by the chores of daily  
routine.   
Whereas if I return home, I could sit uninturrupted in meditative stillness  
for days   
on end,' I was nagged by a feeling of guilt at being a guru's guest,  
regularly eating   
here without doing any work in return. I discussed the matter with  
Ramakrishna   
Swami and he agreed with me. So both of us saluted Bhagavan by way of leave   
taking and He gave me a silent nod. We resolved to remain at home in  
isolation,   
absorbed in samadhi, talk to no one when talked to, and never attempt to meet   
each other. With these resolutions we reached our respective homes.   
My people, who had been worried of my whereabouts, were very happy to see me   
back. As decided earlier, my friend and I stayed in our homes, keeping  
silence.   
My folks did not mind my silence, delighted as they were to have me back home.   
Some days went by thus. The meditative poise which I had experienced in  
Bhagavan's proximity steadily declined and then was totally gone. I then  
realized   
my foolhardiness. I could neither come to terms with my disenchantment not  
give   
vent to it by telling someone. During the period of dilemma Ramakrishna Swami   
called on me one night. What a coincidence! He too was sailing in the same  
boat,   
he said. We had counsel between ourselves. We felt ashamed at our haughtiness  
of   
assuming to have attained that exalted state, which, in days of yore, people  
could   
attain only after dwelling in jungle hermitages for many years, living close  
to spiritual   
masters and through intense efforts on their own part. In retrospect, I  
regretted   
my conceit in dragging out with me Ramakrishna Swami too who had found  
tranquility in Bhagavan's proximity. We now understood the power of our  
Bhagavan's   
physical presence. We realized that to remain anymore at home would be of no  
avail,   
and that the only thing to be done was to seek refuge again at Bhagavan's  
feet.   
Fixing a date of departure thence, my friend returned home. I conveyed my  
decision   
to my parents. Shocked and least prepared for it, they did all they could to  
persuade   
me to remain home, but I was firm in my resolve. I tried to placate them  
saying that our of the the four or five children of theirs, it would be a  
matter of pride for them   
if one of their offsprings takes to spirituality and that they in fact would  
lose nothing   
by my going away. This time I did not want to run away unannounced. I would  
go   
only with the blessings of my elders. Besides, I assured them that I would  
ever be in   
Tiruvannamalai with Bhagavan, and that they were welcome at any time to visit   
me and likewise, I too shall visit them. After such reasoning, I put their  
minds at rest   
and took leave of them.

Arunachala Siva.

Serving the Guru: We set out a couple of days as planned and reached Tiruvannamalai. We felt  
delighted   
when Bhagavan gave us a smile of welcome. During my earlier visit, I felt  
uneasy   
dining as a guest of my Guru without being of any service to Him, which I  
thought   
was not proper. This time, however, I felt at ease on this count because  
Bhagavan   
gave me an opportunity rare to have. Readying hot water for Bhagavan's bath,   
laundering His daily wear, massaging His feet with medicinal oil before  
bedtime   
\-- such daily chores were done by Perumal Swami, who had to leave station two  
days   
after my arrival. He, in some way, deemed me fit to take his place. He must  
have   
reckoned that trained in pious ways from childhood, I would not breach  
observances   
of tradition and hence entrusted me with these jobs. Had I returned to  
Tiruvannamalai a couple of days later, I would have missed this opportunity.   
I now recalled Bhagavan's words of consolation to His grieving mother when   
Annamalai Swami, whose duty all these had that then been, passed away. At  
that time Bhagavan had said, 'Here is this boy now come to serve in  
Annamalai's place.'   
Within just a few days after He uttered them, Bhagavan had taken me slave.  
Thrilled with this prophesy coming true, I remained holding the holy feet of  
Bhagavan firmly   
at heart. I could not cease wondering how Bhagavan, out of His grace, thus  
took me captive. The sense of wonder it then evoked has lost its freshness  
even today in   
1992, seventy two years after. Incidentally, Ramakrishna Swami was asked to  
look   
after the outer affairs of the Asramam and to serve Bhagavan on the occasions  
of my   
absence.   
One day I ventured to ask Bhagavan why those exalted states which I had first   
experienced in Bhagavan's proximity began to wane away and then were  
altogether   
gone when I left Him and reached Kerala. By way of answer to my query,  
Bhagavan asked me to read verses 83 to 93 in Tattuva Vilakka Padalam of  
Kaivalya Navaneetam, wherein lay the answer to my query: contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.

83. On hearing this, the disciple, loyal to the instructions of the Master,   
discarded the five sheaths and went beyond the blank, realized the Self as   
'I am Brahman' and remained as the Perfect Being.   
84\. At the glance of the Master, who was Grace incarnate, the worthy disciple   
sank into the Ocean of Bliss and merged as the undivided Whole, as Pure   
Consciousness free from body, organs and all else, with mind made perfect,  
and he became the true Self, experiencing the deep sleep state in the waking  
state.   
85\. After the blessed disciple had remained in that state for a long time,  
his mind   
gradually turned outward. Then he saw his glorious Master before him.   
His eyes were filled with tears of joy. He was full of love and fell at the  
feet of the   
Master. He rose up, came round the Master, and with folded hands spoke to  
him: 86. 'Lord, you are Reality remaining as my inmost Self, ruling me during all my   
countless incarnations! I do not see how I can repay your grace for having   
liberated me. Glory! Glory to your holy feet!'   
87. The Master beamed on him as he spoke, drew him near and said lovingly: 'To stay fixed in the Self, without the three kinds of obstacles obstructing  
your   
experience, is the highest return you can render me.'   
88. 'My Lord! Can such realization that has transcended the dual perception   
of 'You' and 'I' and found the Self to be entire and all pervading, fail me at  
any   
time?' The Master replied: 'The truth that ' I am Brahman' is realized from  
the   
scriptures or by grace of the Master, but it cannot be firm in the face of  
obstructions.'   
89. Ignorance, uncertainty and wrong knowledge are obstacles resulting from long   
standing habits in the innumerable incarnations of the past which cause  
trouble,   
and then the fruits of realization slip away. Therefore, root them out by  
listening to   
the Truth, reasoning and meditation, sravana, manana, and nididhyasana.   
90. Checked by incantations, - sthambana - fire will not scorch. Likewise,   
defective realization will not put an end to bondage. Therefore, devote  
yourself   
to hearing the Truth, reasoning and meditation, and root out ignorance,  
uncertainty   
and wrong knowledge.   
91. Ignorance veils the Truth and the Self is Brahman and shows forth multiplicity   
instead. Uncertainty is the confusion resulting from lack of firm faith in  
the words   
of the Master; the illusion that the evanescent world is a reality and the  
body   
is the Self, is the wrong knowledge. So say the sages.   
92. Listening to the Truth is to revert the mind repeatedly to the teaching"   
'That thou art'. Reasoning is the rational investigation of the meaning of  
the   
text, as already heard. Meditation is onepointedness of the mind. If every  
day   
you do these, you will surely gain liberation.   
93. The practice must be kept so long as the sense of knower and knowledge   
persists. No effort is necessary thereafter. Remaining as the pure, eternal   
Consciousness, untainted like ether, and thus liberated while alive, one will   
live for ever as That -- after being disembodied also.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.

Doubts Dispelled: As I was hardly ever away from Bhagavan's proximity, listening to His answers   
to the questions raised by the devotees would clear my doubts as well. In  
addition,   
they taught me many new things. Well, I would encounter difficulty in  
understanding   
some statement or idea found in the Sastras. While waiting for the right  
moment to raise the query, it would happen that another devotee would raise  
the same doubt to   
Bhagavan for explanation and, Bhagavan's reply to him would put both our minds   
at rest. This, indeed, is dvaiva gathi (divine dispensation). A classic  
example is the   
case of King Janaka mentioned in Yoga Vasishtam. There it is said, that this  
king   
acquired spiritual wisdom just by listening to the discussions between siddhas   
(sages). All his doubts thus cleared, Janaka is said to have attained  
experience   
of the Self.   
Vedantic texts such as Vedanta Chudamani speak of Viveka Gathi, Viraktha  
Gathi,   
and Daiva Gathi. Of these, the first one is the path (gathi) of attaining  
Jnana by   
becoming a disciple of a Sadguru, and through studying and assimilating what  
is   
said in the various texts. Jnana that comes like a flash of lightning,  
without   
any effort or favorable circumstances, is the second one. Gautama Buddha,   
the Tamizh saint Pattinathar, and our Bhagavan belong to the second kind.   
A solemn declaration made in Yoga Vasishtam is 'True knowledge will come to   
you as easily as a fruit dropping right into your palm from the sky above.'   
The third type -- someone goes to visit a sage without any volition or   
a specific desire to get enlightenment. At that moment, the guru happens to be   
instructing his disciples through answers to their serious queries. The  
visitor,   
on hearing the guru's words, though not addressed to him, gets enlightened   
and becomes a Jnani. This happens only as a result of merits earned through   
virtuous deeds in his earlier births. It is like a bulb lighting up instantly   
when a current of electricity flows into it when a switch is turned on. This  
mode   
of attaining Jnana is daiva gath. Any one of three dispensations will chance  
upon one   
only by virtue of one's righteous deeds in several births. This is affirmed  
in several   
scriptural texts.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.

The following chapters deal with the early life of Bhagavan in Tiruvannamalai,   
long before Kunju Swami's arrival.   
Neighbor's Animosity: During Bhagavan's initial days of moving into Virupaksha Cave, pilgrims to   
Tiruvannamalai who used to customarily visit those sadhus already living on  
the   
Hill, now began coming to Bhagavan instead. So these sadhus began harassing   
the new comer lest their popularity might be eroded. To rid of them of their  
anxiety,   
Bhagavan decided to move out of the Hill and take to the woods nearby.   
Pranava Deham: At times, Bhagavan used to experience a dissolution of His physical body.   
Unexpectedly like a flash of lightning, His physical frame would disintegrate  
into   
tiny atom-like particles and disappear, leaving only a smoke like, nebulous  
haze.   
Then, like tiny particles of dew, they would reappear and again coalesce. In  
this   
way the physical body would re-concretize. It seems that this used to occur   
during the periods of prolonged sitting without movement or when His physical   
frame was emaciated due to lack of food. This phenomenon is known as 'Pranava   
Deham', where the body disintegrates into disparate, minute particles and  
disappears,   
becoming one with the elements in a body-less state.   
Deciding to undertake a fast and dissolve as Pranava body, one morning  
Bhagavan   
started walking towards Pachai Amman temple to reach the woods.   
At that time, Vasudeva Sastri, then a small boy attending to Veda Pata Sala,   
ran into Bhagavan. 'Why are you out here all alone? Let us go back to  
Virupaksha',   
he said. Bhagavan replied that He wanted to spend a couple of days in the  
woods   
and asked him to return. The little boy began weeping, afraid to leave  
Bhagavan   
all alone. Bhagavan consoled him saying He would be back soon, sent him on  
his way   
and proceeded.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.

Loving Concern of the Chief of the Isanya Mutt: While walking, a cart happened to pass by the road which   
was a little afar. Its occupant was Swami Sathappa, the Head of the Isanya  
Mutt   
(and predecessor of Swami Mahadeva, the present Head.) He was returning from   
a visit to his Mutt's farm property. Seeing Bhagavan from afar and  
identifying Him   
as 'Brahmana Swami' he asked the cart driver to stop, alighted from the cart  
and came rushing near. Bubbling with delight, he said, 'Swami! I never  
expected to see you here. It is my good fortune that I could get your  
darshan. It has been a long cherished wish of mine to welcome you to my Mutt.  
But I did not ask knowing you do not go visiting any where. Now I got my  
chance. Pray do visit our Mutt now.'   
Bhagavan who was wont to go nowhere, tried to turn down the request, but His   
remonstrances were of no avail before the robust Mutt head. Lifting the young   
Brahamana Swami aloft, lean and emaciated by ascetic starvation, Sathappa  
Swami   
simply deposited Him inside his cart. Helpless against this overwhelming  
love,   
Bhagavan could no longer resist.

Siva has a nature of fixing his small toe in the beautiful mountain on the  
King of beautiful Lanka, surrounded by the surging ocean. His punishment was  
also good to the demon. He is the god in Neṟikkāraikkāṭu in Kachi of great  
bustle and long beautiful streets surrounded by a wall of fortification,  
surrounding fields and a deep moat.

To Siva the food is the poison which rose in the roaring sea. He will receive  
alms in the broken skull. He will adorn as ornament to the bones of dead  
persons. The god who wore as ornament a beautiful shell of a tortoise along

and who shot up high as a rising column of fire, so that the two, Vishnu and  
Brahma could not know him. (See 3rd verse.)

the music of Yazh   
in the part where the plaintain trees, thriving fetil cassia, pointed-leafed  
and ape-flowered trees Makiḻ, and the long-standing mast-wood trees are very  
close to each other. He is in the grand city of Sanbai, where the fragrant

elephants.

obeisance to god.
