Hindus say offer the flower of your mind (mano pushpa) to God.They are  
right.There is a great insight   
in that.Unless we put away our mind in the initial stages as an offering to  
God through surrender we cannot   
find the way to our own "Self" which is veiled and hidden under the mind.Mind  
is the greatest biological   
evolution.It has not to be thrown away in the waste paper basket in the name  
of spiritual discipline.   
It is a great instrument given as a gift to us by the existence.But we have to  
find the master who can use it.   
This is here Self-inquiry has a significant role to play in finding our master  
who can use his mind in a sane   
manner effectively.Right now mind is behaving like a master and using you.Till  
one finds his own "Self"   
everybody is a slave to his ego.Once you find your "Self",the mind becomes  
your slave.Seeing the "Self"   
with its splendor as the master,mind is reduced and recognizes what its  
position is and stop behaving   
like a master any longer.When i was a student when the master is not there in  
the class students used   
to do all sorts of things like playing,singing,jumping, quarrelling with each  
other and one of them   
assuming the role of the master.This is their natural behavior when master is  
not there in the class room.   
Once the master enters the class room,every child used to sit where he is  
expected to be including the   
one   
who assumed the role of master.Same is the case with the contents of the mind  
which make up the mind   
when the master of "Self" is yet to come.To find and invite this master Self-  
inquiry is the way and the   
witnessing consciousness is the medium of finding the master.Witnessing  
consciousness is synonymous   
with the spiritual heart.Witnessing is simply slipping out of the mind  
gracefully.The moment you start   
witnessing the thought process you have slipped out of it without creating any  
fight with it.You are   
watching the thought flow standing aside,it is just like watching a heavy  
traffic on the road of a city   
in rush hour sitting silently and watching it from your balcony.As awareness  
level increases thought   
traffic slows down because we no longer participate in it and giving any  
strength to it.One devotee   
asked Bhagawan what is the parameter of spiritual progress? He said if the  
thought traffic is minimal   
or almost absent he is said to be progressing spiritually.   
To observe the contents hidden in the deep   
unconscious layers of the mind to be aware while we relate with others is very  
important because in that   
mirror of relationship the hidden contents of the mind brought to the  
conscious level.The other day   
one of our friend pointed out that i have "lifted" a discourse of Osho and  
published it as note in my   
own name.It is the best opportunity for me to know my intention in posting  
that note,is it for pure   
learning or for sharing a precious material written by some other person,not  
mentioning his name   
and pretend as though it is my own understanding to gain fame,am i posting the  
notes with doer-ship etc.   
Unless that challenge from the other is not faced we will not know that  
content of the mind at the   
conscious level.So we should not escape from relating with the others which  
many times bring pain   
to the ego in course of time,just because of getting exposed in  
relationship.Many do not want to   
be exposed and simply they escape and run away from relationship which amounts  
to running away from   
life because life is relationship.Our innate tendencies will not be revealed  
and spent out if we avoid   
relationship with the other.Unless the tendencies are spent out thought  
process will be out of our   
control.The word Moksha means release of consciousness from its apparent  
imprisonment i tendencies.   
Vasanakshayam(annjhilation of tendencies) is Moksham (Self realization) says  
Adi Sankara.   
Tendencies are annihilated through spending up of them only.That is why we  
should not renounce   
and escape from the world because the world and people in it are mirror in  
which our face can be seen   
on our own.The destruction of that reflected image happens in Self-inquiry but  
that destruction of   
that image does not amount to your destruction.When that image is destroyed,  
for the first time   
you will taste the bliss of ultimate freedom.But people are afraid to jump  
into this unknowable,   
unchartered space and so they avoid Self-inquiry on some plea or the other.   
We have to start witnessing without making direct attack on the mind.Self-  
inquiry is nothing but   
putting the mind aside and bringing the witnessing consciousness which is  
always there with us but   
hidden deep under the mind.Mind resists this putting aside of it because who  
want to be put aside   
from a place where it assumed that it is the master of us for centuries.And we  
want to put it aside   
for something which we do not know what it is? So it must be put aside  
lovingly and carefully,gently.   
In the initial stages mind will not allow you to remain as a witness for  
long.You can experiment it for   
yourself by trying to witness the Sun rise or Sun set,just observing the  
ethereal space of the sky   
or hearing the song of a bird early in the morning.Then you will come to know  
the strength of your   
mind.Mind will take you somewhere in a few moments because if you are present  
in the present tense   
minding i.e thinking is not possible and mind feels it like a death for it and  
starts its activity somehow.   
I asked one friend in UK who worked as an assistant for the editor for  
mountain path for 3 yrs in   
Ramanasramam,why he came back to UK leaving such a great opportunity to live  
in the presence of   
Bhagawan.He is an honest man.He told me that he used to sit in the old hall of  
Bhagawan for   
meditation but in few moments there uncontrollable flow of thoughts started  
and he tried his best   
to come back to tranquility but mind never cooperated with him.He felt he is  
in war with his own mind.   
Many times he forgot where he is and only after quite sometime he came to  
senses and found   
himself in the old hall wasting time as he put it.See how powerful became the  
momentum of thought   
activity which is beyond our control because all the time we are cultivating  
the thought for everything   
even in the contexts where it is not required and its presence is inimical.He  
is not an exceptional case   
he represents the whole humanity.Many times while doing Self-inquiry we forget  
we are witnessing the   
thought activity.Sanat kumara says that this forgetfulness of witnessing  
consciousness is Pramada   
which means that which brings danger to our being.But there is no need for  
frustration because it   
is part of our growth.The very awareness that we are so far are not witnessing  
is enough to continue   
the Self-inquiry.Bringing the mind in tune with the witnessing consciousness  
is the great   
"Art of Self-inquiry".But in the beginning mind is going to be against any  
effort to put it aside.   
But don't create an enemy out of such resisting mind by condemning or hurting  
it.Mind creates   
many hindrances before the master i.e "Self" is awakened but once the mind  
sees the immense   
light of Self inside you,it spontaneously falls in tune with your inner  
"Self".There is no question of   
fighting then from the side of the mind.But before finding the "Self' mind  
will give you every fight   
if you are going to leave it behind or put it aside.Mind is a great  
complicated mechanism born out   
of evolution like the body,we have to preserve it,not fight with it or hurt it  
because it is a very useful   
instrument once the "Self' is found.It is a hindrance before finding the  
"Self' but it is a precious instrument   
to execute marvelous work after finding the "Self".All masters used their mind  
effectively for the   
welfare of all beings in the existence.Condemning the body-mind complex is a  
sado-masochist   
tendency but not a spiritual trait.Only thing is that the body-mind complex  
should be shown its   
proper place to function effectively in the light of "Self" and not allowing  
it assume that it is our   
master of our life which it is doing for many many centuries.So Self-inquiry  
is the art knowing   
what to ignore.

Dear DRPVSSNRAJU, How beautiful post and how true. I agry that we should not  
fight with mind and making an enemy of him. Trough my personal experience i  
saw it can be very harmfull for mental health. It is a tooll,a great one.  
Atleast,very important. "Meating" with Self cant be forced. Im trying to move  
with my natural flow. And everyone have its own.
