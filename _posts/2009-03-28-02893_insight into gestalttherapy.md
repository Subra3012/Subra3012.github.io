## insight into gestalttherapy  
Author: matthias            Date: March 28, 2009, 06:08:49 PM

here int he west it slowly gets common that spiritual teachers also undergo a  
therapy....   
I felt also the need of startingone of hte modern therapies to aid my  
sadhana...   
I would like to share some esxpereinces and ideas about it...   
first of all, all my inner work is dedicated to bhagawan and he is the sole  
guardian and guiding light in htis realm....so this therapy is happening,  
because it wants to happen...it is not a must but also it is a must..   
most people think when they hear psychotherapy that there is alot of "mind-  
stuff" going on, in some cases I think this is true, but when it comes to  
gestalt therapy it is about increasing awereness..not about self reflective  
thinking or becoming a rational functioning self...   
most gestalt therapists are also yogis or mystics, and most of the mystic int  
he west also went through a gestalt therapy....so some good points to start  
one...   
what I expereinced is a simple thing, you are recognized in your  
weakness...this is hard but it also healing...deeply healing...I feel that you  
can go thourhg this stages with mediational practice, but believe this type of  
therapy is saving years of formal meditaion, yoga etc...it is cutting through  
the armor   
you sit there after some time totally naked and in your pain....your body is  
vibrating...my therapeut always says that gestalt is working with cellular  
energy and intelligence not with the head....it is about transforming pattern  
in the muscles and organs...not about changing the thoughts...and it is about  
self awereness (why do I react like this? why does suffering is created in  
this situation?) and also about creating more of the simply presence or  
"mindfullness".....   
after two hours of therapy I can say that my body is much more present, I feel  
it beeing a heavy, moving...pulsing...before I was living in my head or in te  
peace of the self...emotions where not many...they existed but not as an  
important part of myself.....bodily needs where reduced to sleeping, eating  
and sex...   
now I undestand much more of my psychodyamic....it sometimes feel like tons of  
energy is freed from beeing wasted with certain patterns that are in simply  
words unessacary...   
I just can say that it really helps my spiritual praxis immense...I feel more  
in tune with my body, actually I start to feel my body more pure, more direct  
and I beliefe that the way beyond the body is the way through the body, not  
arorund, over or underneath the body...

Basically what I understand from your descriptions is that some kind of  
relaxation takes place, voluntarily, then in that peace, one comes face to  
face with realities of your own self in the world and in the process one for  
the first time sees the reality in its fullest and accept it as it is,  
regulating oneself, adjusting oneself naturally so as to be normal, viz. to  
accept things as they are.   
In terms of scriptures, it is totally accepting the higher authority as the  
doer of all actions and not us. IT is said that not even a leaf would move  
without the Will of the Supreme.   
If one is totally able to accept this, it amounts to absolute surrender.  
Surrender to ones own Self.   
Here in India, every typical Indian inclined spiritually, everyday chants some  
shlokas as a habit, it deep essence is accepting an higher authority and  
praying for his grace. I believe these habits by itself constitute various  
therapy's by themselves. For example the most common prayer chanted by  
everyone is this: Asathomah Satgamayah Lead me from untruth to truth   
Tamasomah Jyothirgamayah Lead me from darkness to light   
Mrityormah Amrithamgamayah Lead me from death to immortality   
Subconsciously we intrinsically accept an higher authority. thats why when one  
prays really sincerely, one is able to experience peace.   
The matter to note specially here is SINCERITY.   
When we have Satsangh we naturally become Sincere in our effort in  
participation. I feel thats the same case with you Matthias, being in a  
therapy as you have stated is one kind of Satsangh and in front of the  
therapist, you involuntarily become very sincere.

dear nagaraj I thought about the differences of india and europe in this  
matter also...   
in india you are brought up with a total different form of understanding the  
reality....   
as you said everything is in the hand of god....there is actually no seperate  
identity etc... this is a different cultural package....yet it is not in all  
parts clear and good in my eyes...   
for example it can take away lot of responsibility...it can be that always  
some sort of god is responsibel for problems and hardships...(this is due to  
mythological believe....and retional thought is seen to be more mature, more  
flexibel..), it has not so much good things to say about the body etc...   
so there are also extrem parts of your culture...   
I know the relaxation in meditation and also the peace that you expereince, I  
practice daily meditation and regulary 1h of yoga....but it is always a coming  
and going of peace...because in social interaction your vasanas are pulling  
stronger....and here the therapy is coming into the play and I feel that it  
will save lot of meditation effort....   
of course there are akso aprts of the lower self that are hidden and even in  
deep meditation you can go arround them...I think that in an ashram this  
issues will come up...but not if you always practice in solitude, you can  
cheat yourself very good (I know this from myself)   
as conclusion from your text I see that you understand me very well, this  
therapy is part of my sadhana and a good one   
silence

In the corporate office of a large factory in Chennai, they used to   
have a "Shout Hall." Any employee who is sulky or angry about his   
office situation, can go into that Shout Hall, where there are air-tight   
cubicles into which he can shut himself and 'shout at the boss or a co-   
worker' with whom his has no completeness, gestalt. After shouting for  
sometime, he can come back. The results showed that the employees became more  
relaxed with that introduction of Shout Hall!   
There are seveal ways of letting up, your pent feelings in life. But do not  
show it to your wife.

## Veera Subbaiha Swami  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 30, 2009, 08:44:50 AM

Veera Subbaiah Swami was Head of Kovilur Math. He was endowed with strong  
faith and will, nad had the requisite influence and force   
of character to found numerous Vedapata Salas and choultries and   
renovate numerous temples in South India. Swami first came to see   
Bhagavan Ramana, with a number of Math Heads, when Bhagavan   
Ramana was still staying in Virupaksha Cave. He has also written   
a commentary on Jnana Vasishatam. He first saw Bhagavan Ramana's Ulladu  
Narpadu, (Sad Darsanam) and was thrilled at the profound meaning and rich  
experience embedded in His writings. Kunju Swami used to visit Kovilur Math,  
in Tiruvannamalai, at Bhagavan's instance, whenever there was a function  
there.   
Veera Subbaiah Swami renovated the Tiruturaipundi temple. This place is near  
Nagapattinam, in east coast. On the car festival day of the renovated temple,  
the car did not move, after some distance.   
The people told Swami to give an offering of goat or a cock, so that   
the car would move. Swami did not agree and went to the extent of saying: If  
you are so interested, you can give me as bali, offering.   
I am prepared to die for the sake of movement of the car! He went to the  
sanctum sanctorum of the Temple and prayed intently to Siva for hours and then  
came back. The car then was pulled and it started moving. When the car came  
to the North Street, where Veera Subbaiah Swami was staying in a hut, they  
showed arti to Siva and Uma and people shouted Hara Hara, in ecstasy. Veera  
Subbaiah Swami, who was very old and sick then, came out to see the arti,  
braced in the arms of his friend Subbarya Iyer. As he was watching the arti,  
tears flowed from his eyes, and in front of the car, he departed from the  
world, in the arms of Subbraya Iyer!   
Sri Kanchi Chandrasekara Saraswati Swami, who was witnessing the episode later  
said: He was such a great soul that he merged with Siva at the appropriate  
moment! The bali was also given by his own nirvana on that evening!
