D.: Where has it been said that this knowledge is the all? On the other hand  
it is said that maya became the all.   
M.: Yes. Maya is the knowledge which is spoken of. Only this objective  
knowledge goes under the different names, maya, avidya, bondage, impurity,  
darkness, ignorance, the mind, the cycles of repeated births and deaths etc.   
D.: Be it so, what has this got to do with the extinction of the mind? M.: Listen. You must understand that the knowledge signified by all these terms is  
only the mind.   
32-33. D.: Who else says so? M.: Vasishta has said to Rama: Whatever  
objective knowledge manifests as this and that, or not this and not that, or  
in any other manner, it is only the mind. The mind is nothing but this  
manifest knowledge.   
34\. D.: Let it be so. How can the mind be extinguished? M.: To forget  
everything is the ultimate means. But for thought, the world does not arise.  
Do not think and it will not arise. When nothing arises in the mind, the mind  
itself is lost. Therefore do not think of anything, forget all. This is the  
best way to kill the mind.   
35-37.D.: Has anyone else said so before? M.: Vasishta said so to Rama thus: Efface thoughts of all kinds, of things enjoyed, not enjoyed, or otherwise.  
Like wood or stone, remain free from thoughts.   
Rama: Should I altogether forget everything? Vasishta: Exactly; altogether  
forget everything and remain like wood or stone.   
Rama: The result will be dullness like that of stones or wood.   
Vasishta: Not so. All this is only illusion. Forgetting the illusion, you are  
freed from it. Though seeming dull, you will be the Bliss Itself. Your  
intellect will be altogether clear and sharp. Without getting entangled in  
worldly life, but appearing active to others remain as the very Bliss of  
Brahman and be happy. Unlike the blue colour of the sky, let not the illusion  
of the world revive in the pure Ether of Consciousness-Self. To forget this  
illusion is the sole means to kill the mind and remain as Bliss. Though Shiva,  
Vishnu, or Brahman Himself should instruct you, realisation is not possible  
without this one means. Without forgetting everything, fixity as the Self is  
impossible. Therefore altogether forget everything.   
38-39. D.: Is it not very difficult to do so? M.: Though for the ignorant it  
is difficult, for the discerning few it is very easy. Never think of anything  
but the unbroken unique Brahman. By a long practice of this, you will easily  
forget the non-self. It cannot be difficult to remain still   
without thinking anything. Let not thoughts arise in the mind; always think of  
Brahman. In this way all worldly thoughts will vanish and thought of Brahman  
alone will remain. When this becomes steady, forget even this, and without  
thinking I am Brahman, be the very Brahman. This cannot be difficult to  
practise.   
40\. Now my wise son, follow this advice; cease thinking of anything but  
Brahman. By this practice your mind will be extinct; you will forget all and  
remain as pure Brahman.   
(Advaita Bodha Deepika)

Maya is Mother Uma. Siva is Father, the Self. Both are to be worshipped.   
Unless, one gets Uma's grace, Maya cannot be conquered. When Maya   
gets conquered, Maya merges with Siva, as Ardhanari. It is for the   
concorporate form that Unnamulai did penance in Arunachala and got   
merged with Siva. Maya in Bhagavan's words is mind-stuff. If   
Maya is overcome, then she becomes Maha Maya, Uma with Siva.   
Then, she guides the devotee to Siva, the self realization. Saint   
Manikkavachagar sings: I am praying to You, whose one half is the lady,   
my mother.   
Arunachala Siva.
