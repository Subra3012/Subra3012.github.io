## What does Bhagavan mean to me?  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: April 26, 2010, 09:56:53 AM  
---  
Wolter A. Keers writes in the Birth Centenary Volume of Bhagavan   
(1980): "What has Bhagavan meant to me, and what does He will mean to me?" I find  
that it is impossible to give a neat answer to this   
question.   
The first thing, perhaps, is that He opened my heart. Immediately   
when I saw Him, even from a distance, I recognized that this was   
what I had been looking for. But when I say that this was 'radiating',   
all-penetrating and all-overthrowing love striking me with the power   
of lightning, I know that only those who had the same experience   
will know what I mean. To anybody else, this is all a verbiage, at   
best, creating an image of someone very magnificent.   
Inside and outside the ashrams in the world, crowds of people   
put on their face saying, "Oh, how marvelous, such a Maharshi,   
such a wonderful teaching."   
Beware, let us face it. In the eyes of common sense, an appearance   
like Sri Ramana Maharshi is the embodiment of the most outrageous   
and perhaps even dangerous lunacy that man could think of!   
Well, Sri Ramana Maharshi was the Unimaginable, and therefore   
the Indescribable.   
Perhaps it is after all, not such a blessing to India that in that   
country (and there is no country I love and respect more than   
India), one can believe and say all the right things without being   
locked up. For it makes it possible to repeat the right words   
and remain fast asleep. But if you live in London or Melbourne   
or Ottawa or Amsterdam, and you go to baker early in the morning   
and you tell him, "Of course, I was never born!" and you repeat   
it to the green grocer and to a policeman and to a doctor, I would   
like to see how long you still roam about free in the streets of   
such cities, (without being taken custody by police!).   
It is perhaps not such an undivided blessing that the one whom   
some of us regard as their master has become so accepted and   
respected. For to go to the Asramam and to read the Talks with   
Ramana Maharshi, requires no guts these days.   
But to see what He meant; that you, fool, are one big bankruptcy;   
that.....

I found this from David Godman's interview on Nisargadatta Maharaj.   
 "Then he glared at me (David) and added, 'Don't waste your time giving spiritual talks until you are enlightened yourself, until you know from direct experience what you are talking about. **Otherwise you will end up like that Wolter Keers. '  
 Wolter Keers was a Dutch advaita teacher who toured around Europe, giving lectures on advaita and yoga in at least three different languages. **He was a very fluent and informative teacher and he used to come to see Maharaj regularly. Every time he came, Maharaj would shout at him, telling him he wasn 't enlightened, and that he shouldn't set himself up as a teacher until he was.** I got the message. I have never given a public talk since then.   
And this is from Osho: "The crowd that surrounded Beedie Baba was also of the  
same quality... rickshaw wallahs waiting for their passengers, sitting by the  
side of Beedie Baba. **And when he said he would not speak to anybody unless  
it was this Dutchman... So he spoke to the Dutchman, who has now compiled  
books on Beedie Baba. Now in India it is almost parrot-like, but to the  
Westerner it seems to be a tremendous revelation -- when Beedie Baba said,  
"Aham brahmasmi; I am God, I am that" the young Dutchman immediately wrote a  
book: I AM THAT!** Because for the West, spirituality is a foreign affair,  
just as for the East, science is a foreign affair. !   
I know that he is speaking aobut Wolter Keers, because he translated I Am That  
in dutch. So he seemed to be a good student of Nisargadatta until he  
proclaimed to be enlightened himself and Nisargadatta went ballistic over  
that.

Dear Joey,   
I read your post and noted the contents. These anecdotes of   
Nisargadatta Maharaj and Osho, I have not heard before.   
For that matter, it was the practice of Nisargadatta to criticize   
some of the devotees of Bhagavan Ramana. I do not know why he should have  
done that. If you read how Wolter Keers laid his life, you will be surprised.   
He lived in his home for some time. (I do not know much about   
his European tours as well). He became silent. He had only   
Bhagavan's photo in his room. One evening, he called his friends   
for a tea. When it was over, he said: Okay, let me leave. He   
prostrated before Bhagavan's photograph and did not rise up!   
This is again from David Godman.   
Regarding Osho, I never want to react. He had an aids-carrying   
body, 364 Rolls Royces and zero self knowledge. That is all   
his achievements. He spoke very badly about Ramana Himself.   
Please read David Godman's one of the recent articles in his blog.   
Bhagavan Ramana has once said that when a seeker leaves his   
body, after being unconscious and without combing back from   
unconsciousness or coma, he would not have been liberated.   
Nisargadatta left his body, after being unconscious for sometime,   
without coming back to consciousness. If it is blasphemy, I am   
sorry.   
Arunachala Siva.

No comments on Nissarga   
But Osho clearly does not understand the Truth.

Hey, I agree with you about Osho (for the most part). I only quoted him  
because according to the quote it seemed that Nisargadatta saw great potential  
in Wolter Keers.   
And Nisargadatta had enormous respect towards Bhagavan. He once said to  
Ganesan: "I never had a chance to prostrate to your great-uncle Ramana  
Maharshi, so I am prostrating to you instead. This is my prostration to him."   
He also said that one of his few regrets in life was that he never met  
Bhagavan in person.

Dear Amiatall,   
For someone to be a jnani, he should first and the foremost, have understood  
the Truth!   
Osho does not qualify this itself.   
he has not understood the Truth.   
Nissargadatta passes it, beyond all traces of doubt. But somehow i feel, his  
teachings are not properly presented at certain places.   
Love!

For that matter, it was the practice of Nisargadatta to criticize   
some of the devotees of Bhagavan Ramana.  
Nisargadatta seemed often harsh to people but it didn't matter at all to him  
wheter they were christians, jews, hindus, buddhists or devotees of Bhagavan.

Famous american Buddhist teacher Jack Kornfield described his experience with  
Nisargadatta Maharaj like this: "Being with Nisargadatta gave me the deepest  
experience that I have ever had, of closeness to a human being who was truly  
free. And that freedom was filled with love and aliveness and spontaneity and  
fearlesness and place of absolute stillness beyond all of that. He also said: "Part of what made it so extraordinary to be with Nisargadatta, was to be with  
someone who wanted nothing from you. I have never in my life been with other  
person who wanted less from me or anybody. And in that 'not wanting' there was  
a sense of tremendous freedom and tremendous love."   
And this comes from a man who has met countless saints and sages and even  
spent time in Thailand's forest monastery with legendary Ajahn Chah.

Excellent description Udai Shankar Garu.   
Once bhagavan ramana said,   
There is only one state, that of consciousness or awareness or existence. The  
three states of waking, dream and sleep cannot be real. They simply come and  
go.   
We may roughly put it like this.Existence or consciousness is the only  
reality. Consciousness plus waking, we call waking.Consciousness plus sleep,  
we call sleep. Consciousness plus dream, we call dream.   
**Consciousness is the screen on which all the pictures come and go. The  
screen is real, the pictures are mere shadows on it.**

Dear Prasanth,   
Suppose i see a sweet. and lets say doctor adviced me not to eat it!   
Tomorrow i go to the doctor and he says "your sugar levels are bad"   
I say: "Yes doctor, its all because of that bakery fellow"   
Doctor: "what did he do ?"   
I: He put a Sweet, with nice colors on it   
D: Then?   
I: The Sweet is the cause for these sugar levels   
D: Did the sweet pull you towards it and force you to eat it? or did the  
bakery person do it?   
I: Neither!   
D: Then ?   
I: Its this mind sir!   
D: Did the mind pull the sweet towards you?   
I: Mind gave me a thought.   
Doctor turns towards another person who was also there. .. and asks "Did not  
the thought come to u as well?"   
He replies "Yes"   
so now doctor asks: "He too has the thought, but he did not eat. who is the  
culprit?"   
I: Its me!   
Please see, my friend, mind is innocent. its a lifeless entity... jada  
padartha. its job is to give u ur stored memories. if it does not do that  
there is trouble.   
so if one has no mind. .. he becomes totally like a rock. its useless.   
one needs to know how to handle ones mind. .. and not get rid of it!   
Love!

yes, i agree control of the mind and senses are very much required.   
Afterall Bhagavad Gita deals with this in many verses.   
Dear Udai Garu and Other Members,   
I have one more doubt.   
In the below link thread you said   
http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/forum/index.php?topic=4824.msg13193#msg13193   
To have no Raga-Dvesha. Not possible.   
To not come under the Sway of Raga-Dvesha is Realization.   
Even a Realized person has Raga-Dvesha. No one can say eating neem leaves is  
the same as eating ice cream.   
I will agree with the above statement completly as even ramana liked to eat  
the iddlies and chilly powder he requested during the last month of his life.   
But lets take any animal for example pig.   
I wonder if pig has any Raga-Dvesha with regards to food.We all know that pig  
generally eats human waste as food and releases the same.   
Now if lets say idly is given to pig will it have more raga towards this food  
is my doubt?   
If no,then can we say animals are better than us with regards to control of  
tongue in this context?   
if yes,then no problems as we can univerally declare that no one can escape  
from Raga-Dvesha atleast in regards towards food.

One cannot escape Raga-Dvesha.   
Animals have Raga-Dvesha too. Perhaps they have more gross kind of Raga-  
Dvesha: they cannot differentiate subtlities. One of my uncles had a Dog. ..  
which loved Music!   
No one. .. however much one practices. .. can say neem leaves are tastier than  
ice cream. Even if Ramana is asked. .. he would not say such a thing.   
But Ramana would not come under the Sway of Raga-Dvesha. That is the way to  
liberation.   
A/C is comfortable than sitting in hot sun in summers. This much no one can  
say no!

Dear srkudai,   
Nice posts, all that you wrote today.   
Many think that since Sivam or Guru is ekam or advaitam, it should   
not appear as something other than non-moving; only as Matter.   
No. It can appear to dance too! Om Rachitachala Tandavaya   
Namah: says Sri Ramana Ashottaram, the dance of achalam!   
How can achalam dance? Achalam's effulgence, gives an appearance   
that it is dazzling and dancing!

So Atman is Consciousness.   
And mind, body etc are the different Koshas. Meaning Seaths.   
Having understood this...Its like playing roles in a drama. One can play roles  
without forgetting that one is not the role. That is the fun. To the Parents I  
am a Son or a Daughter. That is a role. With parents I play that Role. I do  
not say "I am Brahman". I play the role and respect the limitations of Role.  
To wife I am a husband. That is another Role. And These roles are all  
relative. Just Coz i am Brahman. .. i should not take away other person's  
house saying "We both are Brahman" !! In the Relative world, the differences  
will continue. In the Absolute world, differences are impossible.   
And its not even possible to drop all these roles. Coz that is dependent on  
Prarabdha Karma once one is Realized. Whether one should be a king like Janaka  
or a renunciate like Ramana or Suka. .. its determined by Prarabdha Karma of  
the body-mind equipment. The Self itself has no karma. Please note that even  
though Ramana left his house and lived in solitude. .. a whole Ashram got  
built around him! That's prarabdha!   
So one cannot run away from roles. And one should not take oneself to be the  
Roles. Knowing that the relative roles are just like the roles in a Drama  
played in the Presence of Consciousness which has absolutely no roles... one  
can just play with the different roles. But one should not forget that one is  
not the Role, but the one playing these Roles.   
Its like Someone playing the role of Ravana in a drama. .. suddenly forgets  
who he is and takes himself to be Ravana! One can easily imagine the trouble.  
But once he knows himself. .. he need not stop playing the role of Ravana. he  
can not only play the role of Ravana but also the Role of Rama if needed. Both  
are just works of art for him! That is fun! The relative limitations of the  
roles are not my limitations. The roles cannot be perfect. I cannot be  
imperfect! This is the point!   
Its like playing a foot ball match. There are artificial rules created. Those  
rules make the game interesting. So too... Having known that i am none of the  
roles i play... when i play the roles... the limitations of the roles are just  
fun! Coz without limitations it wont remain a game!   
Having understood this one can play various roles in this world. One can play  
the role of a son w.r.t to Father or Mother. One can play the role of a  
Husband or Wife. Or a Brother Sister etc. All roles are beautiful. They become  
a blessing once one knows that one is not the Role. One should know that one  
is Consciousness playing all these relative roles. Then its just Fun. If  
however i forget i am playing the role of a husband and take myself to be the  
husband! Then the whole trouble occurs.   
When Krishna says in BG that one should act without attachment, he just means  
this. One cannot avoid work or action. One has to play the relative roles he  
is involved in. There is no running away. The Knowledge that you do not have  
parents, wife etc is not to make one leave the wife and parents. That would be  
stupid. And more over, that just means one has picked up a new role: that of a  
wandering medicant! If " householder " is one relative role... "Monk" is yet  
another role. One cannot run away from the roles... coz this relative world is  
a Role. There is no way to run away from Roles. And one need not Run Away from  
these Relative roles.   
Love!   
Silence

So Remaining as Consciousness, one can play the relative roles of father  
mother, brother sister, spose, child etc. .. just as an artist plays the roles  
in a drama.   
Knowing fully well that one is Consciousness playing these Roles, one can play  
any role.   
These verses help one withdraw from the mind and mental roles. .. and seeing  
oneself as Consciousness, one can later pick up all the roles and play any  
number of them. Janaka ruled a whole kingdom. .. Sri Ramachandra was also a  
king! Who can claim to be more busy than Sri Krishna? And yet, nowhere do we  
see Krishna forgetting his True Nature. No where does Rama for get his True  
nature.   
Many so called scholars speak absolute nonsense when telling Ramayana. they  
say Rama does not know his true nature! That means he is like any of us! Rama  
was told the Truth by Vasishta himself. If that has not enlightened him. ..  
then Vasishta's teaching is incomplete! Please see. Rama was totally Realized.  
He knew himself. And yet when he lost his wife... he played the role of a  
husband.   
There were thoughts of sorrow. he could have chosen to ignore them or allow  
them. And he chose to allow them... consciously playing the Role of A husband.   
The whole of Ramayana is an illustration of how to live this up.   
The thoughts are required for us to play the roles. Memories are required to  
play roles. And fortunately thoughts are there, memories are there, names are  
there. But unfortunately we take these thoughts, names, memories to be  
ourselves. So when we know ourselves as Consciousenss. .. we clearly see that  
no thought can touch us, no memory can haunt us...When we see this. .. we see  
ourselves as free from the clutches of thoughts. now thoughts are there. .. we  
have the choice to go with them or not. Desires are luxuries. they cannot hold  
us! Rama was playing with the roles so beautifully!! And we shall learn to do  
so in what follows.   
Love!

If we have a car, we would like to go on a ride.   
We would not like to keep it always in parking.   
We would also like to learn to drive and then drive comfortably to where we  
want.   
if someone does not know how to drive he might enter the car hoping to drive  
it. .. but the car might drive him. .. and as a result he would end up  
somewhere else!   
Same with mind. one should "use" mind... one should not be "taken for a ride  
by mind" ! As it is with the mind, so it is with the roles like father,  
mother, brother etc... all roles are nice as long as one is playing the roles  
and one does not lose himself in the roles.   
One should know how to use the mind. unfortunately, when someone goes to a  
Bhajan session or Pranayama session. .. instead of learning to use the mind  
... one just learns to stop it for a few moments. Consequently the same person  
when he is out of the pranayama session, has to face life. .. he is in  
trouble.   
A wise man is one who knows himself and uses the mind rather than "Falling  
into the mind"   
Love!

well said udai garu.   
Always guru ramana says we should be like an actor in a movie.   
Q: I am Awareness, then how to live it up?   
A: Like an actor who plays various roles but never forgets that he is the one  
playing these roles. one should never confuse oneself for the roles one plays  
in life.   
**\-- By Swami Suddhanandaji Of Samvit Sagar Trust**   
Just as an actor is not really affected by the passions which he displays on  
the stage, so also this Jnani, always aware of his perfection, is not affected  
by the seeming pleasures and pains which he regards as a mere illusion, like  
the horns of a hare. **\- TRIPURA RAHASYA**   
Give up hope, says the Vedanta. Why should you hope? You have everything, nay,  
you are everything. What are you hoping for? If a king goes mad, and runs  
about trying to find the king of his country, he will never find him, because  
he is the king himself. He may go through every village and city in his own  
country, seeking in every house, weeping and wailing, but he will never find  
him, because he is the king himself. It is better that we know we are God and  
give up this fool's search after Him; and knowing that we are God we become  
happy and contented. **Give up all these mad pursuits, and then play your part  
in the universe, as an actor on the stage.** **\- Swami Vivekananda**   
How should we act in the world? One should act in the world like an actor on  
the stage. In all actions there is in the background the real Self as the  
underlying principle; remember that and act. **\- Ramana Maharshi**

So does "Detachment" mean   
Leaving Family?   
Not having Feelings of Love for spouse ?   
Not having worrying about a relative's health ?   
Not worrying when your kid takes to bad habits?   
Not having ambitions for a better career ?   
Not having any desires?   
No! None of These!   
Detachment means not removing the "Feelings". .. but knowing that feelings  
cannot touch me. I as Consciousness am that in whose presence Feelings are  
possible. Knowing this, one has to recognize that feelings are the properties  
of the roles and have nothing to do with ME, Pure Consciousness.   
That is. .. The householder role has a family. If i leave the family and take  
up sanyas. i just take up another role in place of the householder role. That  
is not detachment.   
Its really to remain as householder and know that one is beyond all these  
relative roles that makes a person special.   
Lets take another example... the thoughts of sex for example. if they are not  
present, there is no way to involve in a sexual relationship. If they are  
present and they drive us crazy that is even worse. A saint is one who is the  
master of his thoughts.   
He is one who treats the thoughts as suggestions and not commands.   
that is he is not "Dragged" by thoughts.. . he uses them.   
That is detachment.   
Most people suggest not having a particular kind of thought. .. and say taht  
is detachment. Detachment in essence is to know that one is beyond all  
thoughts... one is Consciousness... and then no thought can drag... no thought  
is special... and being as such one can play any role with ease!   
So how do we start treating thoughts as suggestions and not commands? Lets  
explore this.   
Love!

once a monk asked another monk what is the nature of thought   
the other monk gazed at him and said i thought so   
another monk joined them and said the universe is set up to record every  
action   
a fourth monk joined them and said dinner is ready   
the zen master came and ate their food

do u want to hear a good story   
i had to buy a new bike for small shoppings   
it came with a handpump! and now i have a manual ventilator   
a very tiny one (it is very warm now)   
do u know what i see when i meet people   
i consume them all   
the handicapped, the elder, the young, the child, the mother, the father, the  
friend, brother, sister, stranger   
the hurt the happy the sick the healthy the dying the rude the polite the  
criminal the business man the beggar   
i consume them all they all enter me   
even the frog   
i see them all being consumed by my spirit   
the ones most hurt i actually see them hesitating sometimes but they also  
enter me   
nobody can deny pure love when it comes   
in the end i will consume even my body   
they burn in the fire of my love   
sometimes i see their faces on my spirit with an expression of amazement   
because of the love but they can always handle it because theres enough for  
everyone   
sometimes these faces in amazement they linger on for a bit, staying heck i  
dont know where, somewhere   
sometimes i whisper them something when i want to play with them   
in the end tho, even my spirit is a dream   
who ever said diving in the heart would be boring
