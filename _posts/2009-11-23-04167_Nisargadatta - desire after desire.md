Sri Soundarya Lahari Saptaham or the Seven days Chanting of   
Sri Soundarya Lahari was started by the Pontiff of Sri Sarada   
Math, Sringeri, a few years back. It is popular in Karnatka   
and Tamil Nadu. From today, that is Kartika Poornima Saptami   
to Kartik Poornima (1st December) the select verse of Sri Soundarya Lahari, a  
Devi Stuti of Sri Sankara, is chanted 24 or 108 times,   
along with full chanting of 100 verses once. This takes about   
45 minutes. The songs are chanted or sung in Sindhu Bhairavi   
Raga. This year the first verse has been selected. Siva Saktya   
yukto....   
Kartik Sashti is Skanda's festival. From Saptami Devi worship   
starts. On Poornima Siva shines in all His glory on the Hill   
of Arunachala!   
Arunachala Siva.

## Nisargadatta : desire after desire

Such giving up of desires, does it need time ?   
If you leave it to time, millions of years will be needed. Giving up desire  
after desire is a lengthy process with the end never in sight. Leave alone  
you desires and fears, give you entire attention to the subject, to him who  
is behind the experience of desire and fear.   
Ask : "who desires?" and let each desire bring you back to yourself""

Dear rideforever,   
The desires cause vasanas. One cannot leave all the desires   
quickly. It takes time as per one's Vasanas, which are coming   
from a number of previous births. Self-Attention helps one   
to overcome these desires. Bhagavan Ramana says: "Desiring   
the Self is the only desire one can have and this desire helps   
other desires to fall apart."   
Arunachala Siva.
