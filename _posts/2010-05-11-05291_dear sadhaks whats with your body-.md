**Excerpts from Hatha Yoga Pradipika**   
 **On Samadhi** : 1\. Salutation to the Guru, the dispenser of happiness to all, appearing as  
Nada, Vindu and Kali. One who is devoted to him, obtains the highest bliss.   
2\. Now I will describe a regular method of attaining to Samadhi, which  
destroys death, is the means for obtaining happiness, and gives the  
Brahmananda.   
3-4. Raja Yoga, Samadhi, Unmani, Manonmani, Amaratwa, Laya, Tatwa, Sunya,  
Asunya, Parama Pada, Amanasska, Adwaitama, Niralamba, Niranjana, Jiwana Mukti,  
Sahaja, Turya, are all synonymous.   
5\. As salt being dissolved in water becomes one with it, so when Atma and  
mind become one, it is called Samadhi.   
6\. When the Prana becomes lean (vigourless) and the mind becomes absorbed,  
then their becoming equal is called Samadhi.   
7\. This equality and oneness of the self and the ultra self, when all  
Samkalpas cease to exist, is called Samadhi.   
8\. Or, who can know the true greatness of the Raja Yoga. Knowledge, mukti,  
condition, and Siddhis can be learnt by instructions from a guru alone.   
9\. Indifference to worldly enjoyments is very difficult to obtain, and  
equally difficult is the knowledge of the Realities to obtain. It is very  
difficult to get the condition of Samadhi, without the favor of a true guru.   
10\. By means of various postures and different Kumbhakas, when the great  
power (Kundali) awakens, then the Prana becomes absorbed in Sunya (Samadhi).   
11\. The Yogi whose sakti has awakened, and who has renounced all actions,  
attains to the condition of Samadhi, without any effort.   
12\. When the Prana flows in the Susumna, and the mind has entered sunya, then  
the Yogi is free from the effects of Karmas.   
13\. O immortal one (that is, the yogi who has attained to the condition of  
Samadhi), I salute thee! Even death itself, into whose mouth the whole of this  
moveable and immovable world has fallen, has been conquered by thee.   
14\. Amaroli, Vajroli and Saholi are accomplished when the mind becomes calm  
and Prana has entered the middle channel.   
15\. How can it be possible to get knowledge, so long as the Prana is living  
and the mind has not died? No one else can get moksa except one who can make  
one's Prana and mind latent.   
16\. Always living in a good locality and having known the secret of the  
Susumna, which has a middle course, and making the Vayu move in it, (the Yogi)  
should restrain the Vayu in the Brahma randhra.   
17\. Time, in the form of night and day, is made by the sun and the moon. That  
the Susumna devours this time (death) even, is a great secret.   
18\. In this body there are 72,000 openings of Nadis; of these, the Susumna,  
which has the Sambhavi Sakti in it, is the only important one, the rest are  
useless.   
19\. The Vayu should be made to enter the Susumna without restraint by him who  
has practiced the control of breathing and has awakened the Kundali by the  
(gastric) fire.   
20\. The Prana, flowing through the Susumna, brings about the condition of  
manonmani; other practices are simply futile for the Yogi.   
21\. By whom the breathing has been controlled, by him the activities of the  
mind also have been controlled; and, conversely, by whom the activities of the  
mind have been controlled, by him the breathing also has been controlled.   
22\. There are two causes of the activities of the mind; (1) Vasana (desires)  
and (2) the respiration (the Prana). Of these, the destruction of the one is  
the destruction of both.   
23\. Breathing is lessened when the mind becomes absorbed, and the mind  
becomes absorbed when the Prana is restrained.   
24\. Both the mind and the breath are united together, like milk and water;  
and both of them are equal in their activities. Mind begins its activities  
where there is the breath, and the Prana begins its activities where there is  
the mind.   
25\. By the suspension of the one, therefore, comes the suspension of the  
other, and by the operations of the one are brought about the operations of  
the other. When they are present, the Idriyas (the senses) remain engaged in  
their proper functions, and when they become latent then there is moksa.   
26\. By nature, Mercury and mind are unsteady: there is nothing in the world  
which cannot be accomplished when these are made steady.   
27\. O Parvati! Mercury and breathing, when made steady, destroy diseases and  
the dead himself comes to life (by their means). By their (proper) control,  
moving in the air is attained.   
28\. The breathing is calmed when the mind becomes steady and calm; and hence  
the preservation of bindu. The preservation of this latter makes the satwa  
established in the body.   
29\. Mind is the master of the senses, and the breath is the master of the  
mind. The breath in its turn is subordinate to the laya (absorption), and that  
laya depends on the nada.   
30\. This very laya is what is called moksa, or, being a sectarian, you may  
not call it moksa; but when the mind becomes absorbed, a sort of ecstasy is  
experienced.   
31\. By the suspension of respiration and the annihilation of the enjoyments  
of the senses, when the mind becomes devoid of all the activities and remains  
changeless, then the Yogi attains to the Laya Stage.   
32\. When the thoughts and activities are destroyed, then the Laya Stage is  
produced, to describe which is beyond the power of speech, being known by  
self-experience alone.   
33\. They often speak of Laya; but what is meant by it? Laya is simply the  
forgetting of the objects of senses when the Vasanas (desires) do not rise  
into existence again.   
 **The Sambhavi Mudra** : 34\. The Vedas and the Sastras are like ordinary public women. Sambhavi Mudra  
is the one, which is secluded like a respectable lady.   
35\. Aiming at Brahman inwardly, while keeping the sight directed to the  
external objects, without blinking the eyes, is called Sambhavi Mudra, hidden  
in the Vedas and the Sastras.   
36\. When the Yogi remains inwardly attentive to the Brahman, keeping the mind  
and the Prana absorbed, and the sight steady, as if seeing everything while in  
reality seeing nothing outside, below, or above, verily then it is called the  
Sambhavi Mudra, which is learnt by the favor of a guru. Whatever, wonderful,  
Sunya or Asunya is perceived, is to be regarded as the manifestation of that  
great Sambhu (Siva).   
37\. The two states, the Sambhavi and the Khechari, are different because of  
their seats (being the heart and the space between the eyebrows respectively);  
but both cause happiness, for the mind becomes absorbed in the Chita-sukha-  
Rupa-atmana which is void.   
 **The Unmani** : 38\. Fix the gaze on the light (seen on the tip of the nose) and raise the  
eyebrows a little, with the mind contemplating as before (in the Sambhavi  
Mudras, that is, inwardly thinking of Brahma, but apparently looking outside).  
This will create the Unmani avastha at once.   
 **The Taraka** : 39\. Some are devoted to the Vedas, some to Nigama, while others are enwrapt  
in Logic, but none knows the value of this mudra, which enables one to cross  
the ocean of existence.   
40\. With steady calm mind and half closed eyes, fixed on the tip of the nose,  
stopping the Ida and the Pingala without blinking, he who can see the light  
which is the all, the seed, the entire brilliant, great Tatwama, approaches  
Him, who is the great object. What is the use of more talk?   
41\. One should not meditate on the Linga (i.e., Atman) in the day (i.e.,  
while Surya or Pingala is working) or at night (when Ida is working), but  
should always contemplate after restraining both.   
 **The Khechari** : 42\. When the air has ceased to move in the right and the left nostrils, and  
has begun to flow in the middle path, then Khechari Mudra can be accomplished  
there. There is no doubt of this.   
43\. If the Prana can be drawn into the Sunya (Susumna), which is between the  
Ida and the Pingala, and made motionless there, then the Khechari Mudra can  
truly become steady there.   
44\. That Mudra is called Khechari which is performed in the supportless space  
between the Surya and the Chandra (the Ida and the Pingala) and called the  
Vyoma Chakra.   
45\. The Khechari which causes the stream to flow from the Chandra (Soma) is  
the beloved of Siva. The incomparable divine Susumna should be closed by the  
tongue drawn back.   
46\. It can be closed from the front also (by stopping the movements of the  
Prana), and then surely it becomes the Khechari. By practice, this Khechari  
leads to Unmani.   
47\. The seat of Siva is between the eyebrows, and the mind becomes absorbed  
there. This condition (in which the mind is thus absorbed) is known as Turya,  
and death has no access there.   
48\. The Khechari should be practiced till there is Yoga-nidra (Samadhi). One  
who has induced Yoga-nidra, cannot fall a victim to death.   
49\. Freeing the mind from all thoughts and thinking of nothing, one should  
sit firmly like a pot in the space (surrounded and filled with the ether).   
50\. As with air, in and out of the body, remains unmoved, so the breath with  
mind becomes steady in its place (i.e., in Brahma randhra).   
51\. By thus practicing, night and day, the breathing is brought under  
control, and, as the practice increases, the mind becomes calm and steady.   
52\. By rubbing the body over with Amrita (exuding from the moon), from head  
to foot, one gets Mahakaya, i.e., great strength and energy.   
 **End of the Khechari** : 53\. Placing the mind into the Kundalini, and getting the later into the mind,  
by looking upon the Buddhi (intellect) with mind (reflexively), the Param Pada  
(Brahma) should be obtained.   
54\. Keep the atma inside the Kha (Brahma) and place Brahma inside your atma.  
Having made everything pervaded with Kha (Brahma), think of nothing else.   
55\. One should become void in and void out, and void like a pot in the space.  
Full in and full outside, like a jar in the ocean.   
56\. He should be neither of his inside nor of his outside world; and, leaving  
all thoughts, he should think of nothing.   
57\. The whole of this world and all the schemes of the mind are but the  
creations of thought. Discarding these thoughts and taking leave of all  
conjectures, O Rama! obtain peace.   
58\. As camphor disappears in fire, and rock salt in water, so the mind united  
with the atma loses its identity.   
59\. When the knowable, and the knowledge, are both destroyed equally, then  
there is no second way (i.e., Duality is destroyed).   
60\. All this movable and immovable world is mind. When the mind has attained  
to the unmani avastha, there is no dwaita (from the absence of the working of  
the mind).   
61\. Mind disappears by removing the knowable, and, on its disappearance, atma  
only remains behind.   
62\. The high-souled Acharyas (Teachers) of yore gained experience in the  
various methods of Samadhi themselves, and then they preached them to others.   
63\. Salutations to Thee, O Susumna, to Thee O Kundalini, to Thee O Sudha,  
born of Chandra, to Thee O Manonmani! to Thee O great power, energy and the  
intelligent spirit.   
64\. I will describe now the practice of anahata nada, as propounded by  
Goraksa Natha, for the benefit of those who are unable to understand the  
principles of knowledge -- a method, which is liked by the ignorant also.   
65\. Adinatha propounded 1 1/4 crore methods of trance, and they are all  
extant. Of these, the hearing of the anahata nada is the only one, the chief,  
in my opinion.   
66\. Sitting with Mukta asana and with the Sambhavi Mudra, the Yogi should  
hear the sound inside his right ear, with collected mind.   
67\. The ears, the eyes, the nose, and the mouth should be closed and then the  
clear sound is heard in the passage of the Susumna which has been cleansed of  
all its impurities.   
68\. In all the Yogas, there are four states: (1) arambha or the preliminary,  
(2) Ghata, or the state of a jar, (3) Parichaya (known), (4) nispatti  
(consummate).   
 **Arambha Avastha** : 69\. When the Brahma granthi (in the heart) is pierced through by Pranayama,  
then a sort of happiness is experienced in the vacuum of the heart, and the  
anahat sounds, like various tinkling sounds of ornaments, are heard in the  
body.   
70\. In the arambha, a Yogi's body becomes divine, glowing, healthy, and emits  
a divine smell. The whole of his heart becomes void.   
 **The Ghata Avastha** : 71\. In the second stage, the airs are united into one and begun moving in the  
middle channel. The Yogi's posture becomes firm, and he becomes wise like a  
god.   
72\. By this means the Visnu knot (in the throat) is pierced which is  
indicated by highest pleasure experienced, and then the Bheri sound (like the  
beating of a kettle drum) is evolved in the vacuum in the throat.   
 **The Parichaya Avastha** : 73\. In the third stage, the sound of a drum is known to arise in the Sunya  
between the eyebrows, and then the Vayu goes to the Mahasunya, which is the  
home of all the siddhis.   
74\. Conquering, then, the pleasures of the mind, ecstasy is spontaneously  
produced which is devoid of evils, pains, old age, disease, hunger and sleep.   
75\. When the Rudra granthi is pierced, and the air enters the seat of the  
Lord (the space between the eyebrows), then the perfect sound like that of a  
flute is produced.   
76\. The union of the mind and the sound is called the Raja-Yoga. The (real)  
Yogi becomes the creator and destroyer of the universe, like God.   
77\. Perpetual Happiness is achieved by this; I do not care if the mukti be  
not attained. This happiness, resulting from absorption (in Brahma), is  
obtained by means of Raja- Yoga.   
78\. Those who are ignorant of the Raja-Yoga and practice only the Hatha-Yoga,  
will, in my opinion, waste their energy fruitlessly.   
79\. Contemplation on the space between the eyebrows is, in my opinion, best  
for accomplishing soon the Unmani state. For people of small intellect, it is  
a very easy method for obtaining perfection in the Raja-Yoga. The Laya  
produced by nada, at once gives experience (of spiritual powers).   
80\. The happiness which increases in the hearts of Yogiswaras, who have  
gained success in Samadhi by means of attention to the nada, is beyond  
description, and is known to Sri Guru Natha alone.   
81\. The sound which a muni hears by closing his ears with his fingers, should  
be heard attentively, till the mind becomes steady in it.   
82\. By practicing with this nada, all other external sounds are stopped. The  
Yogi becomes happy by overcoming all distractions within 15 days.   
83\. In the beginning, the sounds heard are of great variety and very loud;  
but, as the practice increases, they become more and more subtle.   
84\. In the first stage, the sounds are surging, thundering like the beating  
of kettle drums and jingling ones. In the intermediate stage, they are like  
those produced by conch, Mridanga, bells, &c.   
85\. In the last stage, the sounds resemble those from tinklets, flute, Vina,  
bee, &c. These various kinds of sounds are heard as being produced in the  
body.   
86\. Though hearing loud sounds like those of thunder, kettle drums, &c., one  
should practice with the subtle sounds also.   
87\. Leaving the loudest, taking up the subtle one, and leaving the subtle  
one, taking up the loudest, thus practicing, the distracted mind does not  
wander elsewhere.   
88\. Wherever the mind attaches itself first, it becomes steady there; and  
when it becomes absorbed in it.   
89\. Just as a bee, drinking sweet juice, does not care for the smell of the  
flower; so the mind, absorbed in the nada, does not desire the objects of  
enjoyment.   
90\. The mind, like an elephant habituated to wander in the garden of  
enjoyments, is capable of being controlled by the sharp goad of anahata nada.   
91\. The mind, captivated in the snare of nada, gives up all its activity;  
and, like a bird with clipped wings, becomes calm at once.   
92\. Those desirous of the kingdom of Yoga, should take up the practice of  
hearing the anahata nada, with mind collected and free from all cares.   
93\. Nada is the snare for catching the mind; and, when it is caught like a  
deer, it can be killed also like it.   
94\. Nada is the bolt of the stable door for the horse (the minds of the  
Yogis). A Yogi should determine to practice constantly in the hearing of the  
nada sounds.   
95\. Mind gets the properties of calcined mercury. When deprived of its  
unsteadiness it is calcined, combined with the sulphur of nada, and then it  
roams like it in the supportless akasa or Brahma.   
96\. The mind is like a serpent, forgetting all its unsteadiness by hearing  
the nada, it does not run away anywhere.   
97\. The fire, catching firewood, is extinguished along with it (after burning  
it up); and so the mind also, working with the nada, becomes latent along with  
it.   
98\. The antahkarana (mind), like a deer, becomes absorbed and motionless on  
hearing the sound of bells, etc.; and then it is very easy for an expert  
archer to kill it.   
99\. The knowable interpenetrates the anahata sound when it is heard, and the  
mind interpenetrates the knowable. The mind becomes absorbed there, which is  
the seat of the all-pervading, almighty Lord.   
100\. So long as the sounds continue, there is the idea of akasa. When they  
disappear, then it is called Para Brahma, Paramatmana.   
101\. Whatever is heard in the form of nada, is the sakti (power). That which  
is formless, the final state of the Tatwas, is the Parameswara.   
102\. All the methods of Hatha are meant for gaining success in Raja-Yoga;  
for, the man, who is well-established in the Raja-Yoga, overcomes death.   
103\. Tatwa is the seed, Hatha the field; and Indifference (Vairagya) the  
water. By the action of these three, the creeper Unmani thrives very rapidly.   
104\. All the accumulations of sins are destroyed by practicing always with  
the nada; and the mind and the airs do certainly become latent in the  
colorless (Paramatmana).   
105\. Such a one does not hear the noise of the conch and Dundubhi. Being in  
the Unmani avastha, his body becomes like a piece of wood.   
106\. There is no doubt, such a Yogi becomes free from all states, from all  
cares, and remains like one dead.   
107\. He is not devoured by death, is not bound by his actions. The Yogi who  
is engaged in Samadhi is overpowered by none.   
108\. The Yogi, engaged in Samadhi, feels neither smell, taste, color, touch,  
sound, nor is conscious of his own self.   
109\. He whose mind is neither sleeping, waking, remembering, destitute of  
memory, disappearing nor appearing, is liberated.   
110\. He feels neither heat, cold, pain, pleasure, respect nor disrespect.  
Such a Yogi is absorbed in Samadhi.   
111\. He who, though awake, appears like one sleeping, and is without  
inspiration and expiration, is certainly free.   
112\. The Yogi, engaged in Samadhi, cannot be killed by any instrument, and is  
beyond the controlling powers of beings. He is beyond the reach of  
incantations and charms.   
113\. As long as the Prana does not enter and flow in the middle channel and  
the vindu does not become firm by the control of the movements of the Prana;  
as long as the mind does not assume the form of Brahma without any effort in  
contemplation, so long all the talk of knowledge and wisdom is merely the  
nonsensical babbling of a mad man.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sage Vasishtha To Lord Rama How Can One Restrain This Wheel Of Cosmic Maya  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: May 11, 2010, 06:18:44 AM

RAMA asked: But, Holy sir, how can one restrain this wheel of cosmic illusion  
which revolves with such tremendous force?   
 **VASISTHA replied: O Rama, the mind is the hub around which this vicious  
cycle revolves, creating delusion in the minds of the deluded.** It is by  
firmly restraining that hub through intense self-effort and keen intelligence  
that the whole wheel is brought to a standstill. When the hub's motion is  
stopped the wheel does not revolve: when the mind is stilled, illusion ceases.  
One who does not know this trick and does not practice it, undergoes endless  
sorrow; the moment the truth is seen, behold! the sorrow comes to an end.   
 **The disease of the perception of this world-illusion is not cured except  
through the mastery of the mind.** Hence O Rama, abandon all other activities  
like pilgrimage, gifts and austerities, and bring the mind under your control  
for our ultimate good. **This world appearance abides in the mind, even as  
there is space within the pot; if the pot is broken, the illusory division of  
space vanishes and if the mind ceases to be, the concept of a world within the  
mind also ceases to be. Even as an insect trapped within the pot attains  
freedom of movement when the pot is broken, you will also enjoy freedom when  
the mind ceases to be, along with the world-illusion contained in it.**   
Live in the present with your consciousness externalized momentarily, but  
without any effort: when the mind stops linking itself to the past and to the  
future it becomes no-mind. If from moment to moment your mind dwells on what  
is and drops it effortlessly at once, the mind becomes no-mind, full of  
purity. **It is only as long as the mind continues to be agitated that it  
experiences diversity of its own projection or expansion, even as rain falls  
only as long as there are clouds; and it is only as long as the infinite  
consciousness limits itself into the finite mind that such agitation and  
expansion take place.** If consciousness ceases to be the finite mind, then  
know that the very roots of cyclic world-illusion (of birth and death) are  
burnt and there is perfection.

## Re:[16] dear sadhaks whats with your body?

Neo advaita makes it simple but it is not workable. What Beloved   
Abstract posted is not neo advaita, but simple Ajata Vada. Bhagavan   
Ramana was not realized until He reached 16 and then the advaitic   
realization came through death experience, which lasted for about   
15 to 20 minutes. In fact, for sometime, He was thinking that it was a  
pleasant disease! He says this in Sri Arunachala Ashtakam, Verse 1. The  
feeling of maruL, that is the feeling that it was a pleasant disease,  
disappeared when He 'saw' Arunachala. He says "How   
can I say, I saw. There is no 'seer' but only the non-moving Self.   
If I could not say 'I saw', how can I also say 'I could not see'? Who   
can explain this right from the beginning? You have explained this   
by your state of non-movement?   
We are all the Self. But it takes efforts, a lot of them, to realize that we  
are the Self. We are for long long time struggling with the   
various manifestations of non-Self. The Buddha attained it at the   
age of 50 or so. Bhagavan Ramana attained it at the age of 16.   
The devotional history in Tamil says only Tiru Jnana Sambandha attained at the  
age of 3.   
Well written Beloved Abstract.   
Arunachala Siva.
