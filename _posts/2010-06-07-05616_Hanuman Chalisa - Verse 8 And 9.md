Verse 8   
Sankar suvan kesri Nandan   
Tej pratap maha jag vandan   
Verse 9   
Vidyavan guni ati chatur   
Ram kaj karibe ko aatur   
Verse 8 Meaning:  _As a descendant of Lord Sankar, you are a comfort and pride of Shri Kesari.  
With the lustre of your Vast Sway, you are propitiated all over the universe._   
Verse 9 Meaning:  _You are the repository of learning, virtuous and fully accom-plished, always  
keen to carry out the behest 's of Shri Ram._   
 **Commentary :**   
In Verse 8 Tulasidas describes Lord Hanuman as the descendant of Lord  
Sankar(Shiva).   
In Nan Yaar PARAGRAPH SEVEN Bhagavan Guru Ramana says,   
That which actually exists is only atma-svarupa [our own essential self]. The  
world, soul and God are kalpanaigal [imaginations, mental creations or  
fabrications] in it [our essential self], like [the imaginary] silver [that we  
see] in a shell. These three [basic elements of relativity or duality] appear  
at the same time and disappear at the same time. [Our] svarupa [our 'own form'  
or essential self] alone is the world; [our] svarupa alone is 'I' [our mind or  
individual self]; [our] svarupa alone is God; **everything is siva-svarupa  
[our essential self, which is siva, the absolute and only truly existing  
reality].**   
'I am' is Siva or our essential self(atma) is Siva.   
This is very important as known we see un-necessary conflicts between  
Vaishnavaits and Sivaits which occur as they lack proper understanding and  
imagine Lord Shiva Or Vishnu as human beings.   
So ramana maharshi suggests one to attain self-reliasation and see for  
ourselves whether still these conflicts occur or not.   
In **Sankara Vijayam** it is stated that Adi Sankara witnessed bitter infights  
between Saivites and Vaishanavites and below is his suggestion to them.   
Sankara witnessed bitter infights between Saivites and Vaishanavites. He told  
the King to renovate both the temples and also told the subsects to pray to  
their Ishta Devata, their pet god but not have fight with other sects and ill-  
speak about someone's else's faith.Siva will definitely not allow an ill-  
speaking Saiva into Kailash and Vishnu will definitely not allow an ill-  
speaking Vaishnavite into Vaikunta. **If you do Atma Vichara, then, you will  
understand that both reside in your Heart, as nameless and formless, as One  
Principle!**   
Shri kesari mentioned in Verse 8 is the father of Lord Hanuman.Kesari was a  
powerful vanara.   
In Verse 9 greatness of Lord Hanuman is described by Tulasidas and it also  
describes how hanuman was a great bhakta of Lord Shri Rama.   
Bhagavan Sri Ramana has made it quite clear that people who have had no  
literary education could also attain the highest knowledge but people of an  
**emotional nature will benefit themselves more by bhakti and people of a  
reflective mood will have better appeal to jnana.**

Following this topic I want to add few lines here. Hanuman shows how to do  
bhakti towards God or master. He opened his heart and shows there his Ram and  
sita dwell. He teaches people to do bhakti or atma vichara from heart not  
through mind.   
Like Hanuman Jesus also opens His heart.   
All saints talk about the spiritual heart for salvation.   
Ramanaduli

There is one story in Bhakta Vijayam. There was one devout Siva   
bhakta in Pandaripura living right near Panduranga Temple. His   
devotion was so high that he hated Narayana (Panduranga). He   
was a jeweller and also used to make jewels. His name in Kanda   
mani. That is, he used to wear two large bells on his neck or   
ears and whenever somebody says Ramakrishna Hari i.e Vishnu's   
name, he will shake his head so that the bells would ring and he   
would not hear Narayana's name! Once Panduranga wanted to test   
him. There came a rich merchant who wanted to make golden waist belt for  
Panduranga. He asked the cost of gold and making charges for the jewelry.  
Kandamani reluctantly agreed but refused to come into the temple to measure  
the waist size of Panduranga image. The customer then measured in a twain and  
brought it to Kandamani. He made the jewelry but the it was too big. He then  
asked the customerm and he re-measured it. This time, it was too tight.  
Finally it was decided to take in Kandamani. Kandamani said that he would  
close his eyes [so that he would not see Panduranga] and then measure and so a  
cloth was tied to his eyes and he went into the temple.   
Inside the temple, he just touched Panduranga for finding out the waist. He  
suddenly moved his hands to the left of Panduranga and found a breast! He  
then became curious and moved his hands further up. He found matted lock and  
then the moon and the serpents on his head. In a moment, he found a small,  
Sivalinga on the crown of Panduranga! With horripilation, he opened his eyes  
by removing the bandage. He found Panduranga as Ardha Nareeswara Siva!  
Panduranga then told him: You can be a Siva bhakta but do not hate me. If  
Vishnu bhaktas hate Siva, then, I will not be pleased. We are one and the  
same!   
Siva and Vishnu are one and the same. Vishnu is Sakti principle of Siva,  
concorporate. Saint Tirunavukkarasar has sung: If there is no Hari, then there is no Uma for Siva! Siva Vishnu   
differentiation is rampant only in Southern India. In Maharashtra   
and other parts of India there is no such differences among the devotees. But  
of course, ishta devatas are there. In Bengal, everyone prays only to Mother.   
Arunachala Siva.
