I heard from some people that there are Parvada malai, mahadeva malai,  
pavazhcunru. Has anybody from this forum gone visits these hills.   
If so write their experiences.

when i visited arunachala i thought there are many smaller hill like  
structures as part of the main hill. for instance, at one point, i am told,  
bhagwan during his pradikshina used to pause to see the merging of shiva with  
parvati...From one angle one of the smaller hills (parvati) comes into perfect  
alignment with the main hill (siva).   
i do not know if this is what u are referring to, ramanaduli ji.

The Hill is made up of shelf-rocks and there are smaller hills around   
it. There is the famous Panchamuka darsanam on the pradakshina   
route, from where one can see all the five hills. They are contiguous   
structures, with smaller summits. There are other hill not connected to the  
Hill, but they are part of the total environment.   
Arunachala Siva.
