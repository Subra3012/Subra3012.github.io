## Spelling promblem

Sir,   
I have been in the forum for awhile and I'm noticing some unusual thing  
happening when we try to post some thread or new topic.   
It has to do with the spellings, the forum software can understand and correct  
English spellings but not Hindu related spellings.   
Even the spellings such as 'Arunachala' and even 'Bhagavan Sri Ramana  
Maharshi' shows red underline. If you can add these frequency used words into  
the forum software it could be very useful.   
Thanks

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
You are very correct. In fact, the Forum post system has   
not spell-check. People meet with all sorts of spelling   
problems. I always type, "inauguration" as "inaguration"   
many times. Years back, one lady clerk corrected me this   
spelling mistake. Such things do happen, particularly with   
Sanskrit and Tamil words. In Tamil, you have got three   
la's. The first one is simple, the second one needs more   
pressure and the third one is zha. Now how to quote a   
Tamil verse in English. In print, the second la, is shown with   
a dot below l. But it is not possible in computer. Robert Butler   
always spell it correctly in his books on Bhagavan Ramana.   
At the end of the day, if readers could undersand the posts,   
the purpose is served.   
Arunachala Siva.

That's alright but the forum shows 'Arunachala', 'Ramana' as spelling errors.  
Least these important words can be included even if the reader understands it,  
being forum exclusively dedicated to Bhagavan Ramana, honestly I could prefer  
it to change.   
Thanks

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
I agree with you. The words like Ramana, Arunachala,   
Atma, Brahman etc., can be cleared by the mechanism.   
In my comp, spell-check does not work at all. So, I am   
verifying once quickly about the spellings. But mistakes   
do occur.   
Arunachala Siva.

Hi,   
Sorry, but there is no separate Forum dictionary as such.   
What this and every other forum uses, is the default dictionary and  
spellchecker provided by the Server Host. This cannot be edited by users.   
I assume that there is a very good reason for this.   
I suggest that people write their submissions in a word processor and then  
paste it in.   
Graham

If you download a dictionary add-on for your browser i.e. British English  
Dictionary and Spellchecker for Firefox, then all of your errors will show as  
you type.   
You can also add words to the dictionary by right-clicking on the underlined  
words.   
I think that the 'user dictionary' (your additions) is local and does not add  
them to the host's dictionary.
