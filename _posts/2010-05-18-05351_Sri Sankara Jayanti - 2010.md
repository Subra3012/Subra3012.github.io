## Sri Sankara Jayanti - 2010

Sri Sankara Jayanti is celebrated today. He is said to have taken   
birth on a Baisaki Panchami Day with Ardra or Punarvasu star on   
that day. Today is Baiskai Panchami with Punarvasu day. In   
Bangalore, several devotees' group are singing Sri Sankara's hymns   
like Sri Soundarya Lahari and Sri Sivananda Lahari.   
There are several biographies (Sankara Vijayam) of Sankara. There   
are 32 known biographies says Brahmasri Nochur Venkataraman.   
In English history, he is said to have born around 700 AD. But   
Sri Sankara Maths in different parts hold different views. They   
say he is before Christ. Sri Ramakrishna Math publications fix   
the date only around 700 AD. Hindus had no specific recorded   
histories. There were only rock inscriptions and palymra leaves   
which have been eaten time. Hence the difficulty.   
Sri Sankra says in Sri Soundarya Lahari, while praising Mother   
Lalita Tripura Sundari, the consort of Siva: "You have given   
breast milk to the Dravidian (Tamil) child when he was crying   
for milk." This child is said to be Tiru Jnana Sambandhar. Tiru   
Jnana Sambandhar is said to have born around early 7th century.   
Hence one can safely presume that Sri Sankara was born in late   
7th century.   
Sri Sankara went from Rameswaram to Mukti Nath in Himalayas   
by foot, at least two times. He was a prolific scholar and a great   
Brahma Jnani. He was thorough in all scriptures and Vedas and   
Upanishads. His great philosophic work is Viveka Choodamani,   
which Bhagavan Ramana, had rendered in Tamil prose.   
His commentaries on ten important upanishads are quite popular. Sri  
Ramakrishna Math monks have given English translations on   
all the 10 Upanishads. Sri Sankara's commentary on Maandukya   
Upanishad and Gaudapada's Maandukya Upanishad Karika is the   
crown jewel among the Upanishadic commentaries. It is Advaita   
in its peak, Ajata Vada. No creation, no sustenance, no dissolution. Every  
thing is mental fabrication. Bhagavan Ramana was a living example of this  
pure Advaita philosophy.   
Among the short works of Sri Sankara, Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram is again the  
best work. Bhagavan Ramana has also rendered this   
in Tamil verse. Bhagavan Ramana has also picked up 10 important verses of Sri  
Sivananda Lahari for daily chanting.   
Arunachala Siva.

Bhagavan Ramana has also translated in Tamil verses, the Atma   
Bodham of Sri Sankara. Atma Bodham is the abridgment of   
of Viveka Choodamani. His last verse is Dasa Sloki, which   
Sri Sankara recited before his nirvana. He had also sung this   
in the presence of Govinda Bhagavadpada at the Narmada valley   
cave, when he met Govinda first.   
Brahmasri Nochur Venkataraman says Bhagavan Ramana's Who   
am I? and Sankara's Dasa Sloki should be read everyday.   
Arunachala Siva.
