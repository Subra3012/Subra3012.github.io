56. This is joy. I am Brahman. This is joy. I am insentient. 'This' is Brahman -   
of this there is no doubt. This is the truth, this is the truth - again and  
again.   
57\. The glory of the 'Self has been thus enunciated. It is rare to come by in  
all the worlds. The rare one just by hearing this, becomes Brahman itself.   
58. Those who are burdened by worldly existence; whose support is in peace and   
self restraint; who revel in the glory of moon adorned Lord of death ever  
shining   
within, attains quiecence by the words of the Upanishads, the crown of the  
Vedas.   
Thus the chapter twenty, a dialogue between Ribhu and Nidagha entitled 'The  
topic the Glory of the Self' in the sixth amsa called Sankara of  
Sri Siva Rahstyam.   
concluded.   
Arunachala Siva.
