Hello everyone,   
I have desired to be in the company of those who are on the path to find Him,  
and I have joined this forum in the hopes that this company may be found here.  
I hope to learn from each of you so that I may find God in more and more ways.  
I hope to be humbled and to be of service to those who are truly trying to  
seek God, and I wish to find fuel for which my love of God may burn more fully  
from.   
Aleksandr
