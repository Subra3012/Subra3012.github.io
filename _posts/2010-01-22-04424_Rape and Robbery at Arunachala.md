## Rape and Robbery at Arunachala  
Author: Graham              Date: January 22, 2010, 04:45:41 AM  
---  
A few days ago I heard the very disturbing news - that a young attractive  
western girl was raped and murdered on the inner path last week. I am trying  
to verify this story as there has been no media coverage of it whatsoever, but  
the local villagers are talking about it.   
Please pay attention to the following -   
When people come to Tiruvannamalai they imagine that it is full of saintly and  
holy people. Nothing could be further from the truth. There are many spiritual  
people here, but there are also many opportunists.   
Over the past ten years, the robbery and rape of western women has been  
reported a number of times amongst the western community, taking place both on  
the mountain and on the girivalam paths, the inner path being the most common  
because it is isolated. A few years ago two men were imprisoned for robbery  
and rape on the mountain.   
There is a very common and very mistaken belief here that western women are  
easy and want sex with any man. This has come about because of the reportedly  
profligate behaviour of a few women and movies which depict western women in a  
bad light.   
Western culture is very different from Indian culture. Western females are  
generally friendly towards strangers, smiling and talking freely, they also  
hug each other. Unfortunately the western style of close communication is  
taken here as an open invitation to sex by those whose minds live in the sewer  
- it is frowned upon by most Indians.   
Last year a friend of mine came here for a few weeks of meditation and was  
approached within the first few days by two Indian men demanding sex - not  
asking, demanding, one followed her to her accommodation and the other  
approached her in the ashram. She was horrified and very upset by this. I have  
heard of many other females who are constantly pestered in this way.   
Indian females will generally only speak to men they know and only from a  
distance - they will never touch.   
I repeat here the cautionary advice posted in ashrams and elsewhere.   
 **Under no circumstances should ladies go up the mountain or perform  
girivalam alone**.   
I will add a further caution for western ladies - under no circumstances  
should you go anywhere alone with any male that you have not known for a long  
time.   
Do not think that because some fellow sits in meditation pose or speaks of  
religious matters that he is spiritual. Watch carefully if you are approached  
and see if the fellow approaches other women. If he does then avoid him - his  
intent is sex, money or both.   
Do not think that because some fellow wears orange that he is a sadhu (holy  
man) - 99% of those wearing this garb are beggars or worse.   
Four years ago I was told that three of these ochre-robed fellows raped a 12  
year old, very pretty, but mentally challenged Indian girl in the college  
ground near the ashram.   
When the police 'are' informed they will try to do their best with limited  
resources.   
However, prevention is the better course. .... you will rarely see any Indian  
lady climbing the mountain or performing girvalam alone, they take this stance  
out of caution that has been drummed into them since birth and not because  
they feel lonely.   
Do the same!

It is deeply saddening to hear these updates especially in Arunachala, in the  
Hill itself.   
Makes me wonder, Why? Why not atleast not here! Please leave this place at  
least on earth alone!   
I understand, woman folks are best advised not to venture alone on the hill,  
inner path Girivalam. I too have heard from some trusted locals who advised  
even me, men, also not to venture alone as there are a lot of rogues who are  
ready to beat people red and blue and grab whatever money they have.   
But, can we (male) still venture into the inner path alone? is it advisable? I  
have always found the inner path very peaceful, with the pleasant chirping of  
birds, sounds of the air brushing with the leaves of trees, and in the  
presence and upon the Holy hill is very enticing and divine and makes me feel  
at peace with the Self as if in presence of Ramana Maharshi Himself.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
Yes it is horrifying that such things happen here, but they do and there have  
been far worse things happen than I have reported above.   
Despite the cautions people still do the stupidest things out of misplaced  
faith and trust.   
It also appears that the police are not trained or equipped to investigate  
these matters properly (forensically) so the criminals feel free to commit  
their crimes unmolested.   
There is the real danger that these deviants will start to enjoy their  
brutality and want to commit more and more crimes, each worse than the last,  
until finally someone stops them.   
I really don't want to put such items on my site, but it is our duty to try to  
protect those innocents who come here for spiritual purposes.   
Graham

It is natural for western visitors to believe that Tiruvannamalai is a holy  
place and nothing bad can happen, when Bhagavan speaks so highly of  
Arunachala.   
 Hearing that anyone who lives near the hill would be benefited from its  
grace, one might imagine that everyone in Tiruvannamalai would be a good  
person.   
 Only after one visits and stays there for a certain period, he finds that  
Tiruvannamalai is no dream land he had expected.   
 In deeper sense, bad events too must have their meaning. It might be a  
purification process of jivas.   
Even though it could make one wonder 'what happend to the grace of the hill?'  
.

I agree with graham although I think there is a slant in the article (probably  
unintended) implying that only western women are in danger. I came to know of  
an incident a few years back where an Indian woman was followed by a western  
man up the hill. He clearly did not have good intentions. Finally the woman  
had to run out of virupaksha cave and towards the ashram since she realized  
there was nobody else besides the two of them in the cave.   
Everyone needs to extremely vigilant. The place seems to have deviants from  
all over the world.

Let us not forget that Ramana himself was attacked whilst living at  
Thiruvannamalai.   
When Ramana Maharshi was being robbed, his devotees wanted to attack the  
robbers, and he said, "No, no, no. It's our Dharma to be what we are, and  
it's their Dharma to be what they are. We should not interfere with their  
Dharma, therefore give them what they want."

There is divine justice in action here, that is for certain, but it does mean  
that people should throw caution to the wind.   
Bhagavan himself insisted that ladies should not go around the hill alone -  
for a very good reason. This has got more to do with vasanas than Dharma. When  
people come here, everything rises to the surface, good and bad alike. People  
are supposed to address these issues, not indulge in them.

Is not caution another branch of fear? Destiny will play out the way it is  
supposed to. When Bhagavan was hit on the leg with a stick, and refused to  
identify his attackers to the police, his devotees asked why?   
''If you wish to know why they have hit me with a stick, you must find out who  
i have hit with a stick in a past life''.   
This quote is from memory so please forgive me if the exact wording is not  
correct however Who is being cautious? Who fearful? Who is it that is being  
attacked? Who is attacking? All roads lead back to ''Who am i?''

Everything is prarabdha (divine dispensation). But at the same,   
we should also act with some caution for our safety. Sri Ramakrishna   
was once approached by a fellow who was injured by a rogue elephant. He told  
SRK: "Takur! I was thinking that the elephant is Narayana.   
But it has injured me." SRK said: Did you not hear the elephant-   
trainer's caution? saying "Go away, go away, the rogue elephant is   
coming!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Adam,   
When you drive your vehicle, cross a road, or perform any other potentially  
dangerous action in life, do you wear a blindfold? If you have children, do  
you tell them to go out at night alone, trust everyone who approaches them and  
do whatever they demand, or run across roads without looking first?   
Just how far does your faith in the inevitability of karma go?   
Your understanding of this subject is based upon few lines in some book, which  
may or may not be true, and as such is as good as no understanding at all.   
If it were not possible to overcome destiny, then there would be no hope of  
spiritual advancement at all, because such advancement is totally dependent  
upon defeating karma.   
Graham

Is not caution another branch of fear? Destiny will play out the way it is  
supposed to. When Bhagavan was hit on the leg with a stick, and refused to  
identify his attackers to the police, his devotees asked why?   
''If you wish to know why they have hit me with a stick, you must find out who  
i have hit with a stick in a past life''.   
This quote is from memory so please forgive me if the exact wording is not  
correct however Who is being cautious? Who fearful? Who is it that is being  
attacked? Who is attacking? All roads lead back to ''Who am i?''

Everything is prarabdha (divine dispensation). But at the same,   
we should also act with some caution for our safety. Sri Ramakrishna   
was once approached by a fellow who was injured by a rogue elephant. He told  
SRK: "Takur! I was thinking that the elephant is Narayana.   
But it has injured me." SRK said: Did you not hear the elephant-   
trainer's caution? saying "Go away, go away, the rogue elephant is   
coming!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Adam,   
When you drive your vehicle, cross a road, or perform any other potentially  
dangerous action in life, do you wear a blindfold? If you have children, do  
you tell them to go out at night alone, trust everyone who approaches them and  
do whatever they demand, or run across roads without looking first?   
Just how far does your faith in the inevitability of karma go?   
Your understanding of this subject is based upon few lines in some book, which  
may or may not be true, and as such is as good as no understanding at all.   
If it were not possible to overcome destiny, then there would be no hope of  
spiritual advancement at all, because such advancement is totally dependent  
upon defeating karma.   
Graham

## Rape and Robbery at Arunachala  
Author: Graham              Date: January 22, 2010, 04:45:41 AM  
---  
A few days ago I heard the very disturbing news - that a young attractive  
western girl was raped and murdered on the inner path last week. I am trying  
to verify this story as there has been no media coverage of it whatsoever, but  
the local villagers are talking about it.   
Please pay attention to the following -   
When people come to Tiruvannamalai they imagine that it is full of saintly and  
holy people. Nothing could be further from the truth. There are many spiritual  
people here, but there are also many opportunists.   
Over the past ten years, the robbery and rape of western women has been  
reported a number of times amongst the western community, taking place both on  
the mountain and on the girivalam paths, the inner path being the most common  
because it is isolated. A few years ago two men were imprisoned for robbery  
and rape on the mountain.   
There is a very common and very mistaken belief here that western women are  
easy and want sex with any man. This has come about because of the reportedly  
profligate behaviour of a few women and movies which depict western women in a  
bad light.   
Western culture is very different from Indian culture. Western females are  
generally friendly towards strangers, smiling and talking freely, they also  
hug each other. Unfortunately the western style of close communication is  
taken here as an open invitation to sex by those whose minds live in the sewer  
- it is frowned upon by most Indians.   
Last year a friend of mine came here for a few weeks of meditation and was  
approached within the first few days by two Indian men demanding sex - not  
asking, demanding, one followed her to her accommodation and the other  
approached her in the ashram. She was horrified and very upset by this. I have  
heard of many other females who are constantly pestered in this way.   
Indian females will generally only speak to men they know and only from a  
distance - they will never touch.   
I repeat here the cautionary advice posted in ashrams and elsewhere.   
 **Under no circumstances should ladies go up the mountain or perform  
girivalam alone**.   
I will add a further caution for western ladies - under no circumstances  
should you go anywhere alone with any male that you have not known for a long  
time.   
Do not think that because some fellow sits in meditation pose or speaks of  
religious matters that he is spiritual. Watch carefully if you are approached  
and see if the fellow approaches other women. If he does then avoid him - his  
intent is sex, money or both.   
Do not think that because some fellow wears orange that he is a sadhu (holy  
man) - 99% of those wearing this garb are beggars or worse.   
Four years ago I was told that three of these ochre-robed fellows raped a 12  
year old, very pretty, but mentally challenged Indian girl in the college  
ground near the ashram.   
When the police 'are' informed they will try to do their best with limited  
resources.   
However, prevention is the better course. .... you will rarely see any Indian  
lady climbing the mountain or performing girvalam alone, they take this stance  
out of caution that has been drummed into them since birth and not because  
they feel lonely.   
Do the same!

It is deeply saddening to hear these updates especially in Arunachala, in the  
Hill itself.   
Makes me wonder, Why? Why not atleast not here! Please leave this place at  
least on earth alone!   
I understand, woman folks are best advised not to venture alone on the hill,  
inner path Girivalam. I too have heard from some trusted locals who advised  
even me, men, also not to venture alone as there are a lot of rogues who are  
ready to beat people red and blue and grab whatever money they have.   
But, can we (male) still venture into the inner path alone? is it advisable? I  
have always found the inner path very peaceful, with the pleasant chirping of  
birds, sounds of the air brushing with the leaves of trees, and in the  
presence and upon the Holy hill is very enticing and divine and makes me feel  
at peace with the Self as if in presence of Ramana Maharshi Himself.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
Yes it is horrifying that such things happen here, but they do and there have  
been far worse things happen than I have reported above.   
Despite the cautions people still do the stupidest things out of misplaced  
faith and trust.   
It also appears that the police are not trained or equipped to investigate  
these matters properly (forensically) so the criminals feel free to commit  
their crimes unmolested.   
There is the real danger that these deviants will start to enjoy their  
brutality and want to commit more and more crimes, each worse than the last,  
until finally someone stops them.   
I really don't want to put such items on my site, but it is our duty to try to  
protect those innocents who come here for spiritual purposes.

It is natural for western visitors to believe that Tiruvannamalai is a holy  
place and nothing bad can happen, when Bhagavan speaks so highly of  
Arunachala.   
 Hearing that anyone who lives near the hill would be benefited from its  
grace, one might imagine that everyone in Tiruvannamalai would be a good  
person.   
 Only after one visits and stays there for a certain period, he finds that  
Tiruvannamalai is no dream land he had expected.   
 In deeper sense, bad events too must have their meaning. It might be a  
purification process of jivas.   
Even though it could make one wonder 'what happend to the grace of the hill?'

I agree with graham although I think there is a slant in the article (probably  
unintended) implying that only western women are in danger. I came to know of  
an incident a few years back where an Indian woman was followed by a western  
man up the hill. He clearly did not have good intentions. Finally the woman  
had to run out of virupaksha cave and towards the ashram since she realized  
there was nobody else besides the two of them in the cave.   
Everyone needs to extremely vigilant. The place seems to have deviants from  
all over the world.

Let us not forget that Ramana himself was attacked whilst living at  
Thiruvannamalai.   
When Ramana Maharshi was being robbed, his devotees wanted to attack the  
robbers, and he said, "No, no, no. It's our Dharma to be what we are, and  
it's their Dharma to be what they are. We should not interfere with their  
Dharma, therefore give them what they want."

There is divine justice in action here, that is for certain, but it does mean  
that people should throw caution to the wind.   
Bhagavan himself insisted that ladies should not go around the hill alone -  
for a very good reason. This has got more to do with vasanas than Dharma. When  
people come here, everything rises to the surface, good and bad alike. People  
are supposed to address these issues, not indulge in them.

I agree with graham although I think there is a slant in the article (probably  
unintended) implying that only western women are in danger. I came to know of  
an incident a few years back where an Indian woman was followed by a western  
man up the hill. He clearly did not have good intentions. Finally the woman  
had to run out of virupaksha cave and towards the ashram since she realized  
there was nobody else besides the two of them in the cave.   
Everyone needs to extremely vigilant. The place seems to have deviants from  
all over the world.

Let us not forget that Ramana himself was attacked whilst living at  
Thiruvannamalai.   
When Ramana Maharshi was being robbed, his devotees wanted to attack the  
robbers, and he said, "No, no, no. It's our Dharma to be what we are, and  
it's their Dharma to be what they are. We should not interfere with their  
Dharma, therefore give them what they want."

There is divine justice in action here, that is for certain, but it does mean  
that people should throw caution to the wind.   
Bhagavan himself insisted that ladies should not go around the hill alone -  
for a very good reason. This has got more to do with vasanas than Dharma. When  
people come here, everything rises to the surface, good and bad alike. People  
are supposed to address these issues, not indulge in them.

Is not caution another branch of fear? Destiny will play out the way it is  
supposed to. When Bhagavan was hit on the leg with a stick, and refused to  
identify his attackers to the police, his devotees asked why?   
''If you wish to know why they have hit me with a stick, you must find out who  
i have hit with a stick in a past life''.   
This quote is from memory so please forgive me if the exact wording is not  
correct however Who is being cautious? Who fearful? Who is it that is being  
attacked? Who is attacking? All roads lead back to ''Who am i?''

Everything is prarabdha (divine dispensation). But at the same,   
we should also act with some caution for our safety. Sri Ramakrishna   
was once approached by a fellow who was injured by a rogue elephant. He told  
SRK: "Takur! I was thinking that the elephant is Narayana.   
But it has injured me." SRK said: Did you not hear the elephant-   
trainer's caution? saying "Go away, go away, the rogue elephant is   
coming!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Adam,   
When you drive your vehicle, cross a road, or perform any other potentially  
dangerous action in life, do you wear a blindfold? If you have children, do  
you tell them to go out at night alone, trust everyone who approaches them and  
do whatever they demand, or run across roads without looking first?   
Just how far does your faith in the inevitability of karma go?   
Your understanding of this subject is based upon few lines in some book, which  
may or may not be true, and as such is as good as no understanding at all.   
If it were not possible to overcome destiny, then there would be no hope of  
spiritual advancement at all, because such advancement is totally dependent  
upon defeating karma.

## Rape and Robbery at Arunachala  
Author: Graham              Date: January 22, 2010, 04:45:41 AM  
---  
A few days ago I heard the very disturbing news - that a young attractive  
western girl was raped and murdered on the inner path last week. I am trying  
to verify this story as there has been no media coverage of it whatsoever, but  
the local villagers are talking about it.   
Please pay attention to the following -   
When people come to Tiruvannamalai they imagine that it is full of saintly and  
holy people. Nothing could be further from the truth. There are many spiritual  
people here, but there are also many opportunists.   
Over the past ten years, the robbery and rape of western women has been  
reported a number of times amongst the western community, taking place both on  
the mountain and on the girivalam paths, the inner path being the most common  
because it is isolated. A few years ago two men were imprisoned for robbery  
and rape on the mountain.   
There is a very common and very mistaken belief here that western women are  
easy and want sex with any man. This has come about because of the reportedly  
profligate behaviour of a few women and movies which depict western women in a  
bad light.   
Western culture is very different from Indian culture. Western females are  
generally friendly towards strangers, smiling and talking freely, they also  
hug each other. Unfortunately the western style of close communication is  
taken here as an open invitation to sex by those whose minds live in the sewer  
- it is frowned upon by most Indians.   
Last year a friend of mine came here for a few weeks of meditation and was  
approached within the first few days by two Indian men demanding sex - not  
asking, demanding, one followed her to her accommodation and the other  
approached her in the ashram. She was horrified and very upset by this. I have  
heard of many other females who are constantly pestered in this way.   
Indian females will generally only speak to men they know and only from a  
distance - they will never touch.   
I repeat here the cautionary advice posted in ashrams and elsewhere.   
 **Under no circumstances should ladies go up the mountain or perform  
girivalam alone**.   
I will add a further caution for western ladies - under no circumstances  
should you go anywhere alone with any male that you have not known for a long  
time.   
Do not think that because some fellow sits in meditation pose or speaks of  
religious matters that he is spiritual. Watch carefully if you are approached  
and see if the fellow approaches other women. If he does then avoid him - his  
intent is sex, money or both.   
Do not think that because some fellow wears orange that he is a sadhu (holy  
man) - 99% of those wearing this garb are beggars or worse.   
Four years ago I was told that three of these ochre-robed fellows raped a 12  
year old, very pretty, but mentally challenged Indian girl in the college  
ground near the ashram.   
When the police 'are' informed they will try to do their best with limited  
resources.   
However, prevention is the better course. .... you will rarely see any Indian  
lady climbing the mountain or performing girvalam alone, they take this stance  
out of caution that has been drummed into them since birth and not because  
they feel lonely.   
Do the same!

It is deeply saddening to hear these updates especially in Arunachala, in the  
Hill itself.   
Makes me wonder, Why? Why not atleast not here! Please leave this place at  
least on earth alone!   
I understand, woman folks are best advised not to venture alone on the hill,  
inner path Girivalam. I too have heard from some trusted locals who advised  
even me, men, also not to venture alone as there are a lot of rogues who are  
ready to beat people red and blue and grab whatever money they have.   
But, can we (male) still venture into the inner path alone? is it advisable? I  
have always found the inner path very peaceful, with the pleasant chirping of  
birds, sounds of the air brushing with the leaves of trees, and in the  
presence and upon the Holy hill is very enticing and divine and makes me feel  
at peace with the Self as if in presence of Ramana Maharshi Himself.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
Yes it is horrifying that such things happen here, but they do and there have  
been far worse things happen than I have reported above.   
Despite the cautions people still do the stupidest things out of misplaced  
faith and trust.   
It also appears that the police are not trained or equipped to investigate  
these matters properly (forensically) so the criminals feel free to commit  
their crimes unmolested.   
There is the real danger that these deviants will start to enjoy their  
brutality and want to commit more and more crimes, each worse than the last,  
until finally someone stops them.   
I really don't want to put such items on my site, but it is our duty to try to  
protect those innocents who come here for spiritual purposes.   
Graham

It is natural for western visitors to believe that Tiruvannamalai is a holy  
place and nothing bad can happen, when Bhagavan speaks so highly of  
Arunachala.   
 Hearing that anyone who lives near the hill would be benefited from its  
grace, one might imagine that everyone in Tiruvannamalai would be a good  
person.   
 Only after one visits and stays there for a certain period, he finds that  
Tiruvannamalai is no dream land he had expected.   
 In deeper sense, bad events too must have their meaning. It might be a  
purification process of jivas.   
Even though it could make one wonder 'what happend to the grace of the hill?'  
.

It is deeply saddening to hear these updates especially in Arunachala, in the  
Hill itself.   
Makes me wonder, Why? Why not atleast not here! Please leave this place at  
least on earth alone!   
I understand, woman folks are best advised not to venture alone on the hill,  
inner path Girivalam. I too have heard from some trusted locals who advised  
even me, men, also not to venture alone as there are a lot of rogues who are  
ready to beat people red and blue and grab whatever money they have.   
But, can we (male) still venture into the inner path alone? is it advisable? I  
have always found the inner path very peaceful, with the pleasant chirping of  
birds, sounds of the air brushing with the leaves of trees, and in the  
presence and upon the Holy hill is very enticing and divine and makes me feel  
at peace with the Self as if in presence of Ramana Maharshi Himself.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
Yes it is horrifying that such things happen here, but they do and there have  
been far worse things happen than I have reported above.   
Despite the cautions people still do the stupidest things out of misplaced  
faith and trust.   
It also appears that the police are not trained or equipped to investigate  
these matters properly (forensically) so the criminals feel free to commit  
their crimes unmolested.   
There is the real danger that these deviants will start to enjoy their  
brutality and want to commit more and more crimes, each worse than the last,  
until finally someone stops them.   
I really don't want to put such items on my site, but it is our duty to try to  
protect those innocents who come here for spiritual purposes.   
Graham

It is natural for western visitors to believe that Tiruvannamalai is a holy  
place and nothing bad can happen, when Bhagavan speaks so highly of  
Arunachala.   
 Hearing that anyone who lives near the hill would be benefited from its  
grace, one might imagine that everyone in Tiruvannamalai would be a good  
person.   
 Only after one visits and stays there for a certain period, he finds that  
Tiruvannamalai is no dream land he had expected.   
 In deeper sense, bad events too must have their meaning. It might be a  
purification process of jivas.   
Even though it could make one wonder 'what happend to the grace of the hill?'  
.

I agree with graham although I think there is a slant in the article (probably  
unintended) implying that only western women are in danger. I came to know of  
an incident a few years back where an Indian woman was followed by a western  
man up the hill. He clearly did not have good intentions. Finally the woman  
had to run out of virupaksha cave and towards the ashram since she realized  
there was nobody else besides the two of them in the cave.   
Everyone needs to extremely vigilant. The place seems to have deviants from  
all over the world.

Let us not forget that Ramana himself was attacked whilst living at  
Thiruvannamalai.   
When Ramana Maharshi was being robbed, his devotees wanted to attack the  
robbers, and he said, "No, no, no. It's our Dharma to be what we are, and  
it's their Dharma to be what they are. We should not interfere with their  
Dharma, therefore give them what they want."

There is divine justice in action here, that is for certain, but it does mean  
that people should throw caution to the wind.   
Bhagavan himself insisted that ladies should not go around the hill alone -  
for a very good reason. This has got more to do with vasanas than Dharma. When  
people come here, everything rises to the surface, good and bad alike. People  
are supposed to address these issues, not indulge in them.

Is not caution another branch of fear? Destiny will play out the way it is  
supposed to. When Bhagavan was hit on the leg with a stick, and refused to  
identify his attackers to the police, his devotees asked why?   
''If you wish to know why they have hit me with a stick, you must find out who  
i have hit with a stick in a past life''.   
This quote is from memory so please forgive me if the exact wording is not  
correct however Who is being cautious? Who fearful? Who is it that is being  
attacked? Who is attacking? All roads lead back to ''Who am i?''

Everything is prarabdha (divine dispensation). But at the same,   
we should also act with some caution for our safety. Sri Ramakrishna   
was once approached by a fellow who was injured by a rogue elephant. He told  
SRK: "Takur! I was thinking that the elephant is Narayana.   
But it has injured me." SRK said: Did you not hear the elephant-   
trainer's caution? saying "Go away, go away, the rogue elephant is   
coming!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Adam,   
When you drive your vehicle, cross a road, or perform any other potentially  
dangerous action in life, do you wear a blindfold? If you have children, do  
you tell them to go out at night alone, trust everyone who approaches them and  
do whatever they demand, or run across roads without looking first?   
Just how far does your faith in the inevitability of karma go?   
Your understanding of this subject is based upon few lines in some book, which  
may or may not be true, and as such is as good as no understanding at all.   
If it were not possible to overcome destiny, then there would be no hope of  
spiritual advancement at all, because such advancement is totally dependent  
upon defeating karma.   
Graham

## Rape and Robbery at Arunachala  
Author: Graham              Date: January 22, 2010, 04:45:41 AM  
---  
A few days ago I heard the very disturbing news - that a young attractive  
western girl was raped and murdered on the inner path last week. I am trying  
to verify this story as there has been no media coverage of it whatsoever, but  
the local villagers are talking about it.   
Please pay attention to the following -   
When people come to Tiruvannamalai they imagine that it is full of saintly and  
holy people. Nothing could be further from the truth. There are many spiritual  
people here, but there are also many opportunists.   
Over the past ten years, the robbery and rape of western women has been  
reported a number of times amongst the western community, taking place both on  
the mountain and on the girivalam paths, the inner path being the most common  
because it is isolated. A few years ago two men were imprisoned for robbery  
and rape on the mountain.   
There is a very common and very mistaken belief here that western women are  
easy and want sex with any man. This has come about because of the reportedly  
profligate behaviour of a few women and movies which depict western women in a  
bad light.   
Western culture is very different from Indian culture. Western females are  
generally friendly towards strangers, smiling and talking freely, they also  
hug each other. Unfortunately the western style of close communication is  
taken here as an open invitation to sex by those whose minds live in the sewer  
- it is frowned upon by most Indians.   
Last year a friend of mine came here for a few weeks of meditation and was  
approached within the first few days by two Indian men demanding sex - not  
asking, demanding, one followed her to her accommodation and the other  
approached her in the ashram. She was horrified and very upset by this. I have  
heard of many other females who are constantly pestered in this way.   
Indian females will generally only speak to men they know and only from a  
distance - they will never touch.   
I repeat here the cautionary advice posted in ashrams and elsewhere.   
 **Under no circumstances should ladies go up the mountain or perform  
girivalam alone**.   
I will add a further caution for western ladies - under no circumstances  
should you go anywhere alone with any male that you have not known for a long  
time.   
Do not think that because some fellow sits in meditation pose or speaks of  
religious matters that he is spiritual. Watch carefully if you are approached  
and see if the fellow approaches other women. If he does then avoid him - his  
intent is sex, money or both.   
Do not think that because some fellow wears orange that he is a sadhu (holy  
man) - 99% of those wearing this garb are beggars or worse.   
Four years ago I was told that three of these ochre-robed fellows raped a 12  
year old, very pretty, but mentally challenged Indian girl in the college  
ground near the ashram.   
When the police 'are' informed they will try to do their best with limited  
resources.   
However, prevention is the better course. .... you will rarely see any Indian  
lady climbing the mountain or performing girvalam alone, they take this stance  
out of caution that has been drummed into them since birth and not because  
they feel lonely.   
Do the same!

Dear Nagaraj,   
Yes it is horrifying that such things happen here, but they do and there have  
been far worse things happen than I have reported above.   
Despite the cautions people still do the stupidest things out of misplaced  
faith and trust.   
It also appears that the police are not trained or equipped to investigate  
these matters properly (forensically) so the criminals feel free to commit  
their crimes unmolested.   
There is the real danger that these deviants will start to enjoy their  
brutality and want to commit more and more crimes, each worse than the last,  
until finally someone stops them.   
I really don't want to put such items on my site, but it is our duty to try to  
protect those innocents who come here for spiritual purposes.   
Graham

It is natural for western visitors to believe that Tiruvannamalai is a holy  
place and nothing bad can happen, when Bhagavan speaks so highly of  
Arunachala.   
 Hearing that anyone who lives near the hill would be benefited from its  
grace, one might imagine that everyone in Tiruvannamalai would be a good  
person.   
 Only after one visits and stays there for a certain period, he finds that  
Tiruvannamalai is no dream land he had expected.   
 In deeper sense, bad events too must have their meaning. It might be a  
purification process of jivas.   
Even though it could make one wonder 'what happend to the grace of the hill?'  
.

I agree with graham although I think there is a slant in the article (probably  
unintended) implying that only western women are in danger. I came to know of  
an incident a few years back where an Indian woman was followed by a western  
man up the hill. He clearly did not have good intentions. Finally the woman  
had to run out of virupaksha cave and towards the ashram since she realized  
there was nobody else besides the two of them in the cave.   
Everyone needs to extremely vigilant. The place seems to have deviants from  
all over the world.

Let us not forget that Ramana himself was attacked whilst living at  
Thiruvannamalai.   
When Ramana Maharshi was being robbed, his devotees wanted to attack the  
robbers, and he said, "No, no, no. It's our Dharma to be what we are, and  
it's their Dharma to be what they are. We should not interfere with their  
Dharma, therefore give them what they want."

There is divine justice in action here, that is for certain, but it does mean  
that people should throw caution to the wind.   
Bhagavan himself insisted that ladies should not go around the hill alone -  
for a very good reason. This has got more to do with vasanas than Dharma. When  
people come here, everything rises to the surface, good and bad alike. People  
are supposed to address these issues, not indulge in them.

Is not caution another branch of fear? Destiny will play out the way it is  
supposed to. When Bhagavan was hit on the leg with a stick, and refused to  
identify his attackers to the police, his devotees asked why?   
''If you wish to know why they have hit me with a stick, you must find out who  
i have hit with a stick in a past life''.   
This quote is from memory so please forgive me if the exact wording is not  
correct however Who is being cautious? Who fearful? Who is it that is being  
attacked? Who is attacking? All roads lead back to ''Who am i?''

Everything is prarabdha (divine dispensation). But at the same,   
we should also act with some caution for our safety. Sri Ramakrishna   
was once approached by a fellow who was injured by a rogue elephant. He told  
SRK: "Takur! I was thinking that the elephant is Narayana.   
But it has injured me." SRK said: Did you not hear the elephant-   
trainer's caution? saying "Go away, go away, the rogue elephant is   
coming!"

Adam,   
When you drive your vehicle, cross a road, or perform any other potentially  
dangerous action in life, do you wear a blindfold? If you have children, do  
you tell them to go out at night alone, trust everyone who approaches them and  
do whatever they demand, or run across roads without looking first?   
Just how far does your faith in the inevitability of karma go?   
Your understanding of this subject is based upon few lines in some book, which  
may or may not be true, and as such is as good as no understanding at all.   
If it were not possible to overcome destiny, then there would be no hope of  
spiritual advancement at all, because such advancement is totally dependent  
upon defeating karma.

## Rape and Robbery at Arunachala  
Author: Graham              Date: January 22, 2010, 04:45:41 AM  
---  
A few days ago I heard the very disturbing news - that a young attractive  
western girl was raped and murdered on the inner path last week. I am trying  
to verify this story as there has been no media coverage of it whatsoever, but  
the local villagers are talking about it.   
Please pay attention to the following -   
When people come to Tiruvannamalai they imagine that it is full of saintly and  
holy people. Nothing could be further from the truth. There are many spiritual  
people here, but there are also many opportunists.   
Over the past ten years, the robbery and rape of western women has been  
reported a number of times amongst the western community, taking place both on  
the mountain and on the girivalam paths, the inner path being the most common  
because it is isolated. A few years ago two men were imprisoned for robbery  
and rape on the mountain.   
There is a very common and very mistaken belief here that western women are  
easy and want sex with any man. This has come about because of the reportedly  
profligate behaviour of a few women and movies which depict western women in a  
bad light.   
Western culture is very different from Indian culture. Western females are  
generally friendly towards strangers, smiling and talking freely, they also  
hug each other. Unfortunately the western style of close communication is  
taken here as an open invitation to sex by those whose minds live in the sewer  
- it is frowned upon by most Indians.   
Last year a friend of mine came here for a few weeks of meditation and was  
approached within the first few days by two Indian men demanding sex - not  
asking, demanding, one followed her to her accommodation and the other  
approached her in the ashram. She was horrified and very upset by this. I have  
heard of many other females who are constantly pestered in this way.   
Indian females will generally only speak to men they know and only from a  
distance - they will never touch.   
I repeat here the cautionary advice posted in ashrams and elsewhere.   
 **Under no circumstances should ladies go up the mountain or perform  
girivalam alone**.   
I will add a further caution for western ladies - under no circumstances  
should you go anywhere alone with any male that you have not known for a long  
time.   
Do not think that because some fellow sits in meditation pose or speaks of  
religious matters that he is spiritual. Watch carefully if you are approached  
and see if the fellow approaches other women. If he does then avoid him - his  
intent is sex, money or both.   
Do not think that because some fellow wears orange that he is a sadhu (holy  
man) - 99% of those wearing this garb are beggars or worse.   
Four years ago I was told that three of these ochre-robed fellows raped a 12  
year old, very pretty, but mentally challenged Indian girl in the college  
ground near the ashram.   
When the police 'are' informed they will try to do their best with limited  
resources.   
However, prevention is the better course. .... you will rarely see any Indian  
lady climbing the mountain or performing girvalam alone, they take this stance  
out of caution that has been drummed into them since birth and not because  
they feel lonely.   
Do the same!

It is deeply saddening to hear these updates especially in Arunachala, in the  
Hill itself.   
Makes me wonder, Why? Why not atleast not here! Please leave this place at  
least on earth alone!   
I understand, woman folks are best advised not to venture alone on the hill,  
inner path Girivalam. I too have heard from some trusted locals who advised  
even me, men, also not to venture alone as there are a lot of rogues who are  
ready to beat people red and blue and grab whatever money they have.   
But, can we (male) still venture into the inner path alone? is it advisable? I  
have always found the inner path very peaceful, with the pleasant chirping of  
birds, sounds of the air brushing with the leaves of trees, and in the  
presence and upon the Holy hill is very enticing and divine and makes me feel  
at peace with the Self as if in presence of Ramana Maharshi Himself.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

the mountain and on the girivalam paths, the inner path being the most common  
because it is isolated. A few years ago two men were imprisoned for robbery  
and rape on the mountain.   
There is a very common and very mistaken belief here that western women are  
easy and want sex with any man. This has come about because of the reportedly  
profligate behaviour of a few women and movies which depict western women in a  
bad light.   
Western culture is very different from Indian culture. Western females are  
generally friendly towards strangers, smiling and talking freely, they also  
hug each other. Unfortunately the western style of close communication is  
taken here as an open invitation to sex by those whose minds live in the sewer  
- it is frowned upon by most Indians.   
Last year a friend of mine came here for a few weeks of meditation and was  
approached within the first few days by two Indian men demanding sex - not  
asking, demanding, one followed her to her accommodation and the other  
approached her in the ashram. She was horrified and very upset by this. I have  
heard of many other females who are constantly pestered in this way.   
Indian females will generally only speak to men they know and only from a  
distance - they will never touch.   
I repeat here the cautionary advice posted in ashrams and elsewhere.   
 **Under no circumstances should ladies go up the mountain or perform  
girivalam alone**.   
I will add a further caution for western ladies - under no circumstances  
should you go anywhere alone with any male that you have not known for a long  
time.   
Do not think that because some fellow sits in meditation pose or speaks of  
religious matters that he is spiritual. Watch carefully if you are approached  
and see if the fellow approaches other women. If he does then avoid him - his  
intent is sex, money or both.   
Do not think that because some fellow wears orange that he is a sadhu (holy  
man) - 99% of those wearing this garb are beggars or worse.   
Four years ago I was told that three of these ochre-robed fellows raped a 12  
year old, very pretty, but mentally challenged Indian girl in the college  
ground near the ashram.   
When the police 'are' informed they will try to do their best with limited  
resources.   
However, prevention is the better course. .... you will rarely see any Indian  
lady climbing the mountain or performing girvalam alone, they take this stance  
out of caution that has been drummed into them since birth and not because  
they feel lonely.   
Do the same!

It is deeply saddening to hear these updates especially in Arunachala, in the  
Hill itself.   
Makes me wonder, Why? Why not atleast not here! Please leave this place at  
least on earth alone!   
I understand, woman folks are best advised not to venture alone on the hill,  
inner path Girivalam. I too have heard from some trusted locals who advised  
even me, men, also not to venture alone as there are a lot of rogues who are  
ready to beat people red and blue and grab whatever money they have.   
But, can we (male) still venture into the inner path alone? is it advisable? I  
have always found the inner path very peaceful, with the pleasant chirping of  
birds, sounds of the air brushing with the leaves of trees, and in the  
presence and upon the Holy hill is very enticing and divine and makes me feel  
at peace with the Self as if in presence of Ramana Maharshi Himself.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
Yes it is horrifying that such things happen here, but they do and there have  
been far worse things happen than I have reported above.   
Despite the cautions people still do the stupidest things out of misplaced  
faith and trust.   
It also appears that the police are not trained or equipped to investigate  
these matters properly (forensically) so the criminals feel free to commit  
their crimes unmolested.   
There is the real danger that these deviants will start to enjoy their  
brutality and want to commit more and more crimes, each worse than the last,  
until finally someone stops them.   
I really don't want to put such items on my site, but it is our duty to try to  
protect those innocents who come here for spiritual purposes.   
Graham

It is natural for western visitors to believe that Tiruvannamalai is a holy  
place and nothing bad can happen, when Bhagavan speaks so highly of  
Arunachala.   
 Hearing that anyone who lives near the hill would be benefited from its  
grace, one might imagine that everyone in Tiruvannamalai would be a good  
person.   
 Only after one visits and stays there for a certain period, he finds that  
Tiruvannamalai is no dream land he had expected.   
 In deeper sense, bad events too must have their meaning. It might be a  
purification process of jivas.   
Even though it could make one wonder 'what happend to the grace of the hill?'  
.

I agree with graham although I think there is a slant in the article (probably  
unintended) implying that only western women are in danger. I came to know of  
an incident a few years back where an Indian woman was followed by a western  
man up the hill. He clearly did not have good intentions. Finally the woman  
had to run out of virupaksha cave and towards the ashram since she realized  
there was nobody else besides the two of them in the cave.   
Everyone needs to extremely vigilant. The place seems to have deviants from  
all over the world.

Let us not forget that Ramana himself was attacked whilst living at  
Thiruvannamalai.   
When Ramana Maharshi was being robbed, his devotees wanted to attack the  
robbers, and he said, "No, no, no. It's our Dharma to be what we are, and  
it's their Dharma to be what they are. We should not interfere with their

There is divine justice in action here, that is for certain, but it does mean  
that people should throw caution to the wind.   
Bhagavan himself insisted that ladies should not go around the hill alone -  
for a very good reason. This has got more to do with vasanas than Dharma. When

Is not caution another branch of fear? Destiny will play out the way it is  
supposed to. When Bhagavan was hit on the leg with a stick, and refused to  
identify his attackers to the police, his devotees asked why?   
''If you wish to know why they have hit me with a stick, you must find out who  
i have hit with a stick in a past life''.   
This quote is from memory so please forgive me if the exact wording is not  
correct however Who is being cautious? Who fearful? Who is it that is being  
attacked? Who is attacking? All roads lead back to ''Who am i?''

Everything is prarabdha (divine dispensation). But at the same,   
we should also act with some caution for our safety. Sri Ramakrishna   
was once approached by a fellow who was injured by a rogue elephant. He told  
SRK: "Takur! I was thinking that the elephant is Narayana.   
But it has injured me." SRK said: Did you not hear the elephant-   
trainer's caution? saying "Go away, go away, the rogue elephant is   
coming!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Adam,   
When you drive your vehicle, cross a road, or perform any other potentially  
dangerous action in life, do you wear a blindfold? If you have children, do  
you tell them to go out at night alone, trust everyone who approaches them and  
do whatever they demand, or run across roads without looking first?   
Just how far does your faith in the inevitability of karma go?   
Your understanding of this subject is based upon few lines in some book, which  
may or may not be true, and as such is as good as no understanding at all.   
If it were not possible to overcome destiny, then there would be no hope of  
spiritual advancement at all, because such advancement is totally dependent  
upon defeating karma.

## Rape and Robbery at Arunachala  
Author: Graham              Date: January 22, 2010, 04:45:41 AM  
---  
A few days ago I heard the very disturbing news - that a young attractive  
western girl was raped and murdered on the inner path last week. I am trying  
to verify this story as there has been no media coverage of it whatsoever, but  
the local villagers are talking about it.   
Please pay attention to the following -   
When people come to Tiruvannamalai they imagine that it is full of saintly and  
holy people. Nothing could be further from the truth. There are many spiritual  
people here, but there are also many opportunists.   
Over the past ten years, the robbery and rape of western women has been  
reported a number of times amongst the western community, taking place both on  
the mountain and on the girivalam paths, the inner path being the most common  
because it is isolated. A few years ago two men were imprisoned for robbery  
and rape on the mountain.   
There is a very common and very mistaken belief here that western women are  
easy and want sex with any man. This has come about because of the reportedly  
profligate behaviour of a few women and movies which depict western women in a  
bad light.

generally friendly towards strangers, smiling and talking freely, they also  
hug each other. Unfortunately the western style of close communication is  
taken here as an open invitation to sex by those whose minds live in the sewer  
- it is frowned upon by most Indians.   
Last year a friend of mine came here for a few weeks of meditation and was  
approached within the first few days by two Indian men demanding sex - not  
asking, demanding, one followed her to her accommodation and the other  
approached her in the ashram. She was horrified and very upset by this. I have  
heard of many other females who are constantly pestered in this way.   
Indian females will generally only speak to men they know and only from a  
distance - they will never touch.   
I repeat here the cautionary advice posted in ashrams and elsewhere.   
 **Under no circumstances should ladies go up the mountain or perform  
girivalam alone**.   
I will add a further caution for western ladies - under no circumstances  
should you go anywhere alone with any male that you have not known for a long  
time.

resources.

out of caution that has been drummed into them since birth and not because  
they feel lonely.   
Do the same!

Everything is prarabdha (divine dispensation). But at the same,   
we should also act with some caution for our safety. Sri Ramakrishna   
was once approached by a fellow who was injured by a rogue elephant. He told  
SRK: "Takur! I was thinking that the elephant is Narayana.   
But it has injured me." SRK said: Did you not hear the elephant-   
trainer's caution? saying "Go away, go away, the rogue elephant is   
coming!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Adam,   
When you drive your vehicle, cross a road, or perform any other potentially  
dangerous action in life, do you wear a blindfold? If you have children, do  
you tell them to go out at night alone, trust everyone who approaches them and  
do whatever they demand, or run across roads without looking first?   
Just how far does your faith in the inevitability of karma go?   
Your understanding of this subject is based upon few lines in some book, which  
may or may not be true, and as such is as good as no understanding at all.   
If it were not possible to overcome destiny, then there would be no hope of  
spiritual advancement at all, because such advancement is totally dependent  
upon defeating karma.   
Graham

## Rape and Robbery at Arunachala  
Author: Graham              Date: January 22, 2010, 04:45:41 AM  
---  
A few days ago I heard the very disturbing news - that a young attractive  
western girl was raped and murdered on the inner path last week. I am trying  
to verify this story as there has been no media coverage of it whatsoever, but  
the local villagers are talking about it.   
Please pay attention to the following -   
When people come to Tiruvannamalai they imagine that it is full of saintly and  
holy people. Nothing could be further from the truth. There are many spiritual  
people here, but there are also many opportunists.   
Over the past ten years, the robbery and rape of western women has been  
reported a number of times amongst the western community, taking place both on  
the mountain and on the girivalam paths, the inner path being the most common  
because it is isolated. A few years ago two men were imprisoned for robbery  
and rape on the mountain.   
There is a very common and very mistaken belief here that western women are  
easy and want sex with any man. This has come about because of the reportedly  
profligate behaviour of a few women and movies which depict western women in a  
bad light.   
Western culture is very different from Indian culture. Western females are  
generally friendly towards strangers, smiling and talking freely, they also  
hug each other. Unfortunately the western style of close communication is  
taken here as an open invitation to sex by those whose minds live in the sewer  
- it is frowned upon by most Indians.   
Last year a friend of mine came here for a few weeks of meditation and was  
approached within the first few days by two Indian men demanding sex - not  
asking, demanding, one followed her to her accommodation and the other  
approached her in the ashram. She was horrified and very upset by this. I have  
heard of many other females who are constantly pestered in this way.   
Indian females will generally only speak to men they know and only from a  
distance - they will never touch.   
I repeat here the cautionary advice posted in ashrams and elsewhere.   
 **Under no circumstances should ladies go up the mountain or perform  
girivalam alone**.   
I will add a further caution for western ladies - under no circumstances  
should you go anywhere alone with any male that you have not known for a long  
time.   
Do not think that because some fellow sits in meditation pose or speaks of  
religious matters that he is spiritual. Watch carefully if you are approached  
and see if the fellow approaches other women. If he does then avoid him - his  
intent is sex, money or both.   
Do not think that because some fellow wears orange that he is a sadhu (holy  
man) - 99% of those wearing this garb are beggars or worse.   
Four years ago I was told that three of these ochre-robed fellows raped a 12  
year old, very pretty, but mentally challenged Indian girl in the college  
ground near the ashram.   
When the police 'are' informed they will try to do their best with limited  
resources.   
However, prevention is the better course. .... you will rarely see any Indian  
lady climbing the mountain or performing girvalam alone, they take this stance  
out of caution that has been drummed into them since birth and not because  
they feel lonely.   
Do the same!

It is deeply saddening to hear these updates especially in Arunachala, in the  
Hill itself.   
Makes me wonder, Why? Why not atleast not here! Please leave this place at  
least on earth alone!   
I understand, woman folks are best advised not to venture alone on the hill,  
inner path Girivalam. I too have heard from some trusted locals who advised  
even me, men, also not to venture alone as there are a lot of rogues who are  
ready to beat people red and blue and grab whatever money they have.   
But, can we (male) still venture into the inner path alone? is it advisable? I  
have always found the inner path very peaceful, with the pleasant chirping of  
birds, sounds of the air brushing with the leaves of trees, and in the  
presence and upon the Holy hill is very enticing and divine and makes me feel  
at peace with the Self as if in presence of Ramana Maharshi Himself.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
Yes it is horrifying that such things happen here, but they do and there have  
been far worse things happen than I have reported above.   
Despite the cautions people still do the stupidest things out of misplaced  
faith and trust.   
It also appears that the police are not trained or equipped to investigate  
these matters properly (forensically) so the criminals feel free to commit  
their crimes unmolested.   
There is the real danger that these deviants will start to enjoy their  
brutality and want to commit more and more crimes, each worse than the last,  
until finally someone stops them.   
I really don't want to put such items on my site, but it is our duty to try to  
protect those innocents who come here for spiritual purposes.

It is natural for western visitors to believe that Tiruvannamalai is a holy  
place and nothing bad can happen, when Bhagavan speaks so highly of  
Arunachala.   
 Hearing that anyone who lives near the hill would be benefited from its  
grace, one might imagine that everyone in Tiruvannamalai would be a good  
person.   
 Only after one visits and stays there for a certain period, he finds that  
Tiruvannamalai is no dream land he had expected.   
 In deeper sense, bad events too must have their meaning. It might be a  
purification process of jivas.   
Even though it could make one wonder 'what happend to the grace of the hill?'  
.

I agree with graham although I think there is a slant in the article (probably  
unintended) implying that only western women are in danger. I came to know of  
an incident a few years back where an Indian woman was followed by a western  
man up the hill. He clearly did not have good intentions. Finally the woman  
had to run out of virupaksha cave and towards the ashram since she realized  
there was nobody else besides the two of them in the cave.   
Everyone needs to extremely vigilant. The place seems to have deviants from  
all over the world.

Let us not forget that Ramana himself was attacked whilst living at  
Thiruvannamalai.   
When Ramana Maharshi was being robbed, his devotees wanted to attack the  
robbers, and he said, "No, no, no. It's our Dharma to be what we are, and  
it's their Dharma to be what they are. We should not interfere with their  
Dharma, therefore give them what they want."

There is divine justice in action here, that is for certain, but it does mean  
that people should throw caution to the wind.   
Bhagavan himself insisted that ladies should not go around the hill alone -  
for a very good reason. This has got more to do with vasanas than Dharma. When  
people come here, everything rises to the surface, good and bad alike. People  
are supposed to address these issues, not indulge in them.

Is not caution another branch of fear? Destiny will play out the way it is  
supposed to. When Bhagavan was hit on the leg with a stick, and refused to  
identify his attackers to the police, his devotees asked why?   
''If you wish to know why they have hit me with a stick, you must find out who  
i have hit with a stick in a past life''.   
This quote is from memory so please forgive me if the exact wording is not  
correct however Who is being cautious? Who fearful? Who is it that is being  
attacked? Who is attacking? All roads lead back to ''Who am i?''

Let us not forget that Ramana himself was attacked whilst living at  
Thiruvannamalai.   
When Ramana Maharshi was being robbed, his devotees wanted to attack the  
robbers, and he said, "No, no, no. It's our Dharma to be what we are, and  
it's their Dharma to be what they are. We should not interfere with their  
Dharma, therefore give them what they want."

There is divine justice in action here, that is for certain, but it does mean  
that people should throw caution to the wind.   
Bhagavan himself insisted that ladies should not go around the hill alone -  
for a very good reason. This has got more to do with vasanas than Dharma. When  
people come here, everything rises to the surface, good and bad alike. People  
are supposed to address these issues, not indulge in them.

Is not caution another branch of fear? Destiny will play out the way it is  
supposed to. When Bhagavan was hit on the leg with a stick, and refused to  
identify his attackers to the police, his devotees asked why?   
''If you wish to know why they have hit me with a stick, you must find out who  
i have hit with a stick in a past life''.   
This quote is from memory so please forgive me if the exact wording is not  
correct however Who is being cautious? Who fearful? Who is it that is being  
attacked? Who is attacking? All roads lead back to ''Who am i?''

Everything is prarabdha (divine dispensation). But at the same,   
we should also act with some caution for our safety. Sri Ramakrishna   
was once approached by a fellow who was injured by a rogue elephant. He told  
SRK: "Takur! I was thinking that the elephant is Narayana.   
But it has injured me." SRK said: Did you not hear the elephant-   
trainer's caution? saying "Go away, go away, the rogue elephant is   
coming!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Adam,   
When you drive your vehicle, cross a road, or perform any other potentially  
dangerous action in life, do you wear a blindfold? If you have children, do  
you tell them to go out at night alone, trust everyone who approaches them and  
do whatever they demand, or run across roads without looking first?   
Just how far does your faith in the inevitability of karma go?   
Your understanding of this subject is based upon few lines in some book, which  
may or may not be true, and as such is as good as no understanding at all.   
If it were not possible to overcome destiny, then there would be no hope of  
spiritual advancement at all, because such advancement is totally dependent  
upon defeating karma.   
Graham

## Rape and Robbery at Arunachala  
Author: Graham              Date: January 22, 2010, 04:45:41 AM  
---  
A few days ago I heard the very disturbing news - that a young attractive  
western girl was raped and murdered on the inner path last week. I am trying  
to verify this story as there has been no media coverage of it whatsoever, but  
the local villagers are talking about it.   
Please pay attention to the following -   
When people come to Tiruvannamalai they imagine that it is full of saintly and  
holy people. Nothing could be further from the truth. There are many spiritual  
people here, but there are also many opportunists.   
Over the past ten years, the robbery and rape of western women has been  
reported a number of times amongst the western community, taking place both on  
the mountain and on the girivalam paths, the inner path being the most common  
because it is isolated. A few years ago two men were imprisoned for robbery  
and rape on the mountain.   
There is a very common and very mistaken belief here that western women are  
easy and want sex with any man. This has come about because of the reportedly  
profligate behaviour of a few women and movies which depict western women in a  
bad light.   
Western culture is very different from Indian culture. Western females are  
generally friendly towards strangers, smiling and talking freely, they also  
hug each other. Unfortunately the western style of close communication is  
taken here as an open invitation to sex by those whose minds live in the sewer  
- it is frowned upon by most Indians.   
Last year a friend of mine came here for a few weeks of meditation and was  
approached within the first few days by two Indian men demanding sex - not  
asking, demanding, one followed her to her accommodation and the other  
approached her in the ashram. She was horrified and very upset by this. I have  
heard of many other females who are constantly pestered in this way.   
Indian females will generally only speak to men they know and only from a  
distance - they will never touch.   
I repeat here the cautionary advice posted in ashrams and elsewhere.   
 **Under no circumstances should ladies go up the mountain or perform  
girivalam alone**.   
I will add a further caution for western ladies - under no circumstances  
should you go anywhere alone with any male that you have not known for a long  
time.   
Do not think that because some fellow sits in meditation pose or speaks of  
religious matters that he is spiritual. Watch carefully if you are approached  
and see if the fellow approaches other women. If he does then avoid him - his  
intent is sex, money or both.   
Do not think that because some fellow wears orange that he is a sadhu (holy  
man) - 99% of those wearing this garb are beggars or worse.   
Four years ago I was told that three of these ochre-robed fellows raped a 12  
year old, very pretty, but mentally challenged Indian girl in the college  
ground near the ashram.   
When the police 'are' informed they will try to do their best with limited  
resources.   
However, prevention is the better course. .... you will rarely see any Indian  
lady climbing the mountain or performing girvalam alone, they take this stance  
out of caution that has been drummed into them since birth and not because  
they feel lonely.   
Do the same!

It is deeply saddening to hear these updates especially in Arunachala, in the  
Hill itself.   
Makes me wonder, Why? Why not atleast not here! Please leave this place at  
least on earth alone!   
I understand, woman folks are best advised not to venture alone on the hill,  
inner path Girivalam. I too have heard from some trusted locals who advised  
even me, men, also not to venture alone as there are a lot of rogues who are  
ready to beat people red and blue and grab whatever money they have.   
But, can we (male) still venture into the inner path alone? is it advisable? I  
have always found the inner path very peaceful, with the pleasant chirping of  
birds, sounds of the air brushing with the leaves of trees, and in the  
presence and upon the Holy hill is very enticing and divine and makes me feel  
at peace with the Self as if in presence of Ramana Maharshi Himself.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
Yes it is horrifying that such things happen here, but they do and there have  
been far worse things happen than I have reported above.   
Despite the cautions people still do the stupidest things out of misplaced  
faith and trust.   
It also appears that the police are not trained or equipped to investigate  
these matters properly (forensically) so the criminals feel free to commit  
their crimes unmolested.   
There is the real danger that these deviants will start to enjoy their  
brutality and want to commit more and more crimes, each worse than the last,  
until finally someone stops them.   
I really don't want to put such items on my site, but it is our duty to try to  
protect those innocents who come here for spiritual purposes.   
Graham

It is natural for western visitors to believe that Tiruvannamalai is a holy  
place and nothing bad can happen, when Bhagavan speaks so highly of  
Arunachala.   
 Hearing that anyone who lives near the hill would be benefited from its  
grace, one might imagine that everyone in Tiruvannamalai would be a good  
person.   
 Only after one visits and stays there for a certain period, he finds that  
Tiruvannamalai is no dream land he had expected.   
 In deeper sense, bad events too must have their meaning. It might be a  
purification process of jivas.   
Even though it could make one wonder 'what happend to the grace of the hill?'  
.

I agree with graham although I think there is a slant in the article (probably  
unintended) implying that only western women are in danger. I came to know of  
an incident a few years back where an Indian woman was followed by a western  
man up the hill. He clearly did not have good intentions. Finally the woman  
had to run out of virupaksha cave and towards the ashram since she realized  
there was nobody else besides the two of them in the cave.   
Everyone needs to extremely vigilant. The place seems to have deviants from  
all over the world.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Yes it is horrifying that such things happen here, but they do and there have  
been far worse things happen than I have reported above.   
Despite the cautions people still do the stupidest things out of misplaced  
faith and trust.   
It also appears that the police are not trained or equipped to investigate  
these matters properly (forensically) so the criminals feel free to commit  
their crimes unmolested.   
There is the real danger that these deviants will start to enjoy their  
brutality and want to commit more and more crimes, each worse than the last,  
until finally someone stops them.   
I really don't want to put such items on my site, but it is our duty to try to  
protect those innocents who come here for spiritual purposes.   
Graham

It is natural for western visitors to believe that Tiruvannamalai is a holy  
place and nothing bad can happen, when Bhagavan speaks so highly of  
Arunachala.   
 Hearing that anyone who lives near the hill would be benefited from its  
grace, one might imagine that everyone in Tiruvannamalai would be a good  
person.   
 Only after one visits and stays there for a certain period, he finds that  
Tiruvannamalai is no dream land he had expected.   
 In deeper sense, bad events too must have their meaning. It might be a  
purification process of jivas.   
Even though it could make one wonder 'what happend to the grace of the hill?'  
.

I agree with graham although I think there is a slant in the article (probably  
unintended) implying that only western women are in danger. I came to know of  
an incident a few years back where an Indian woman was followed by a western  
man up the hill. He clearly did not have good intentions. Finally the woman  
had to run out of virupaksha cave and towards the ashram since she realized  
there was nobody else besides the two of them in the cave.   
Everyone needs to extremely vigilant. The place seems to have deviants from  
all over the world.

Let us not forget that Ramana himself was attacked whilst living at  
Thiruvannamalai.   
When Ramana Maharshi was being robbed, his devotees wanted to attack the  
robbers, and he said, "No, no, no. It's our Dharma to be what we are, and  
it's their Dharma to be what they are. We should not interfere with their  
Dharma, therefore give them what they want."

There is divine justice in action here, that is for certain, but it does mean  
that people should throw caution to the wind.   
Bhagavan himself insisted that ladies should not go around the hill alone -  
for a very good reason. This has got more to do with vasanas than Dharma. When  
people come here, everything rises to the surface, good and bad alike. People  
are supposed to address these issues, not indulge in them.

Is not caution another branch of fear? Destiny will play out the way it is  
supposed to. When Bhagavan was hit on the leg with a stick, and refused to  
identify his attackers to the police, his devotees asked why?   
''If you wish to know why they have hit me with a stick, you must find out who  
i have hit with a stick in a past life''.   
This quote is from memory so please forgive me if the exact wording is not  
correct however Who is being cautious? Who fearful? Who is it that is being  
attacked? Who is attacking? All roads lead back to ''Who am i?''

Everything is prarabdha (divine dispensation). But at the same,   
we should also act with some caution for our safety. Sri Ramakrishna   
was once approached by a fellow who was injured by a rogue elephant. He told  
SRK: "Takur! I was thinking that the elephant is Narayana.   
But it has injured me." SRK said: Did you not hear the elephant-   
trainer's caution? saying "Go away, go away, the rogue elephant is   
coming!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Adam,   
When you drive your vehicle, cross a road, or perform any other potentially  
dangerous action in life, do you wear a blindfold? If you have children, do  
you tell them to go out at night alone, trust everyone who approaches them and  
do whatever they demand, or run across roads without looking first?   
Just how far does your faith in the inevitability of karma go?   
Your understanding of this subject is based upon few lines in some book, which  
may or may not be true, and as such is as good as no understanding at all.   
If it were not possible to overcome destiny, then there would be no hope of  
spiritual advancement at all, because such advancement is totally dependent  
upon defeating karma.   
Graham

Yes, I think it's best to remember that Ramana himself was robbed and beaten  
by thieves there.   
The world of maya still does what it does no matter who shows up...   
Christ is crucified, Buddha eats tainted rice, Ramana dies of painful cancer  
etc. etc. and we don't understand why these terrible things happen.   
It is very common, though for places connected with saintly people to be seen  
as some kind of heaven on earth, because it was to the degree that heaven was  
brought to earth in the hearts of some, but Ramana said of the thieves "They  
are blinded by ignorance... but let us note what is right and stick to it".   
Notice how he begins by explaining the source of the thieves behavior and then  
brings ones attention away from the others to oneself?

Explained more thoroughly here by Bhagavan himself...   
Is Everything Predetermined?   
By A. Devaraja Mudaliar   
ONE summer afternoon I was sitting opposite   
Bhagavan with a fan in my hand in the Old Hall,   
and said to him: I can understand that the outstanding   
events in a mans life, such as his country, nationality, family,   
career or profession, marriage, death, etc. are all predestined   
by his karma, but can it be that all the details of his   
life, down to the minutest, have already been determined?   
Now, for instance, I put this fan that is in my hand down   
on the floor here. Can it be that it was already decided   
that on such and such a day, at such and a such an hour, I   
shall move the fan like this and put it down here?   
Bhagavan replied, Certainly. He continued: Whatever this body is to do and whatever experiences it   
is to pass through was already decided when it came into   
existence.   
 Thereupon I naturally exclaimed: What becomes then   
of mans freedom and responsibility for his actions?   
Bhagavan explained: The only freedom man has is to   
strive for and acquire the jnana which will enable him not   
to identify himself with the body. The body will go through   
the actions rendered inevitable by prarabdha (destiny   
based on the balance sheet of past lives) and a man is free   
either to identify himself with the body and be attached to   
the fruits of its actions, or to be detached from it and be a   
mere witness of its activities.

Dear Adam,   
Prarabdha is there even for a Jnani. But he does not identify himself with  
the good and bad fruits of prarabdha. His body is ever different from the  
Self that He has realized. That is why when during final years when someone  
asked Him: Is it paining, Bhagavan!, Sri Bhagavan replied: Yes, the body is  
paining.   
He did not say that His body is paining.

Dear Jyoti,   
According to my reading of Sri Bhagavan's devotees, only one   
woman [I think she is Ms. Suzanne] went to the Hill and stayed overnight in  
Virupaksha Cave. Her meditative energy was so intense, that she heard Samaveda  
chantings at night. For such meditative energy, no men could go even near the  
Cave. S.S. Cohen, still as a matter of abudant precaution, was sent to the  
Hill by Sri Bhagavan and she was brought back to the Asramam around 2.30 A.M.  
early   
morning.

Initially when i came across advaita vedanta, my search continued even after  
reading Ramana's works. In time, and also in comparing other teachers to  
Bhagavan, i was drawn back into his teaching. Most others simply do not  
compare. "Measure anyone who promotes themselves as a guru by the conduct of  
Bhagavan and you will not go wrong." This is the best advice i have heard in

Dear Adam,   
Yes. Sri Bhagavan is the yardstick for measurement of other teachers. I find  
most of them do not even come up to His waist. A few months back, I came

"Self Realization in two days. Join immediately." I could not help

Today Satsang Culture is a reflection of what people are. You get the Gurus  
that reflect your inner nature.

Today's Gurus are no doubt Good speakers but there is less Dharma in their own  
day to day life but then again it comes back to people i.e how many people  
live Dharmic life ? Gurus emerge only from those set of people.

Association of the wise is highly recommended by almost every spiritual source  
I've read. The problem is here in the West where is it to be found?   
I don't know how good an idea it is to attend just anything that calls itself  
"Satsang". And even beyond that I had thought of attending,say, a Greek  
Orthodox mass just to be silent and in the company of more spiritually minded  
people rather than worldly people, but that was unsuccessful on many levels. I  
live near Portland Oregon in the US and it has many MANY eastern spiritual  
groups to choose from, even relatively smaller groups (for here) like Meher  
Baba or Radha Soami, but there is no group for Ramana which strikes me as odd.  
Anyway, I would be curious as to any advice on "keeping the company of the  
wise" in the western world. It is very difficult.

Nisargadatta addresses this in I AM THAT, the question and answer format is  
informative and speaks on many levels. If I remember right, He says as long  
as the devotee is earnest, the devotee may find another guru which can be like  
a mile marker who points the way. There are other examples also--devotees not  
earnest enough, moving from one guru to another, etc., to make one blanket  
statement for all seems to be foolhardy, although Reality is One, mankind is  
varied, along with the needs.

I just came back here to mention that I did discover there is one closer to  
me. I had recently done a massive google search looking for places close by  
for possible satsang, but the keywords I used were "satsang", "Hinduism",  
"Advaita" and so on. But once I used the exact term "Chinmaya mission" I found  
there was one (60 miles away, but definitely closer than Chicago!) ;-)   
Anyway, thanks again.

## Rape and Robbery at Arunachala  
Author: Graham              Date: January 22, 2010, 04:45:41 AM  
---  
A few days ago I heard the very disturbing news - that a young attractive  
western girl was raped and murdered on the inner path last week. I am trying  
to verify this story as there has been no media coverage of it whatsoever, but  
the local villagers are talking about it.   
Please pay attention to the following -   
When people come to Tiruvannamalai they imagine that it is full of saintly and  
holy people. Nothing could be further from the truth. There are many spiritual  
people here, but there are also many opportunists.   
Over the past ten years, the robbery and rape of western women has been  
reported a number of times amongst the western community, taking place both on  
the mountain and on the girivalam paths, the inner path being the most common  
because it is isolated. A few years ago two men were imprisoned for robbery  
and rape on the mountain.   
There is a very common and very mistaken belief here that western women are  
easy and want sex with any man. This has come about because of the reportedly  
profligate behaviour of a few women and movies which depict western women in a  
bad light.   
Western culture is very different from Indian culture. Western females are  
generally friendly towards strangers, smiling and talking freely, they also  
hug each other. Unfortunately the western style of close communication is  
taken here as an open invitation to sex by those whose minds live in the sewer  
- it is frowned upon by most Indians.   
Last year a friend of mine came here for a few weeks of meditation and was  
approached within the first few days by two Indian men demanding sex - not  
asking, demanding, one followed her to her accommodation and the other  
approached her in the ashram. She was horrified and very upset by this. I have  
heard of many other females who are constantly pestered in this way.   
Indian females will generally only speak to men they know and only from a  
distance - they will never touch.   
I repeat here the cautionary advice posted in ashrams and elsewhere.   
 **Under no circumstances should ladies go up the mountain or perform  
girivalam alone**.   
I will add a further caution for western ladies - under no circumstances  
should you go anywhere alone with any male that you have not known for a long  
time.   
Do not think that because some fellow sits in meditation pose or speaks of  
religious matters that he is spiritual. Watch carefully if you are approached  
and see if the fellow approaches other women. If he does then avoid him - his  
intent is sex, money or both.   
Do not think that because some fellow wears orange that he is a sadhu (holy  
man) - 99% of those wearing this garb are beggars or worse.   
Four years ago I was told that three of these ochre-robed fellows raped a 12  
year old, very pretty, but mentally challenged Indian girl in the college  
ground near the ashram.   
When the police 'are' informed they will try to do their best with limited  
resources.   
However, prevention is the better course. .... you will rarely see any Indian  
lady climbing the mountain or performing girvalam alone, they take this stance  
out of caution that has been drummed into them since birth and not because  
they feel lonely.   
Do the same!

It is deeply saddening to hear these updates especially in Arunachala, in the  
Hill itself.   
Makes me wonder, Why? Why not atleast not here! Please leave this place at  
least on earth alone!   
I understand, woman folks are best advised not to venture alone on the hill,  
inner path Girivalam. I too have heard from some trusted locals who advised  
even me, men, also not to venture alone as there are a lot of rogues who are  
ready to beat people red and blue and grab whatever money they have.   
But, can we (male) still venture into the inner path alone? is it advisable? I  
have always found the inner path very peaceful, with the pleasant chirping of  
birds, sounds of the air brushing with the leaves of trees, and in the  
presence and upon the Holy hill is very enticing and divine and makes me feel  
at peace with the Self as if in presence of Ramana Maharshi Himself.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
Yes it is horrifying that such things happen here, but they do and there have  
been far worse things happen than I have reported above.   
Despite the cautions people still do the stupidest things out of misplaced  
faith and trust.   
It also appears that the police are not trained or equipped to investigate  
these matters properly (forensically) so the criminals feel free to commit  
their crimes unmolested.   
There is the real danger that these deviants will start to enjoy their  
brutality and want to commit more and more crimes, each worse than the last,  
until finally someone stops them.   
I really don't want to put such items on my site, but it is our duty to try to  
protect those innocents who come here for spiritual purposes.   
Graham

It is natural for western visitors to believe that Tiruvannamalai is a holy  
place and nothing bad can happen, when Bhagavan speaks so highly of  
Arunachala.   
 Hearing that anyone who lives near the hill would be benefited from its  
grace, one might imagine that everyone in Tiruvannamalai would be a good  
person.   
 Only after one visits and stays there for a certain period, he finds that  
Tiruvannamalai is no dream land he had expected.   
 In deeper sense, bad events too must have their meaning. It might be a  
purification process of jivas.   
Even though it could make one wonder 'what happend to the grace of the hill?'  
.

I agree with graham although I think there is a slant in the article (probably  
unintended) implying that only western women are in danger. I came to know of  
an incident a few years back where an Indian woman was followed by a western  
man up the hill. He clearly did not have good intentions. Finally the woman  
had to run out of virupaksha cave and towards the ashram since she realized  
there was nobody else besides the two of them in the cave.   
Everyone needs to extremely vigilant. The place seems to have deviants from  
all over the world.

Let us not forget that Ramana himself was attacked whilst living at  
Thiruvannamalai.   
When Ramana Maharshi was being robbed, his devotees wanted to attack the  
robbers, and he said, "No, no, no. It's our Dharma to be what we are, and  
it's their Dharma to be what they are. We should not interfere with their  
Dharma, therefore give them what they want."

There is divine justice in action here, that is for certain, but it does mean  
that people should throw caution to the wind.   
Bhagavan himself insisted that ladies should not go around the hill alone -  
for a very good reason. This has got more to do with vasanas than Dharma. When  
people come here, everything rises to the surface, good and bad alike. People  
are supposed to address these issues, not indulge in them.

Is not caution another branch of fear? Destiny will play out the way it is  
supposed to. When Bhagavan was hit on the leg with a stick, and refused to  
identify his attackers to the police, his devotees asked why?   
''If you wish to know why they have hit me with a stick, you must find out who  
i have hit with a stick in a past life''.   
This quote is from memory so please forgive me if the exact wording is not  
correct however Who is being cautious? Who fearful? Who is it that is being  
attacked? Who is attacking? All roads lead back to ''Who am i?''

Everything is prarabdha (divine dispensation). But at the same,   
we should also act with some caution for our safety. Sri Ramakrishna   
was once approached by a fellow who was injured by a rogue elephant. He told  
SRK: "Takur! I was thinking that the elephant is Narayana.   
But it has injured me." SRK said: Did you not hear the elephant-   
trainer's caution? saying "Go away, go away, the rogue elephant is   
coming!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Adam,   
When you drive your vehicle, cross a road, or perform any other potentially  
dangerous action in life, do you wear a blindfold? If you have children, do  
you tell them to go out at night alone, trust everyone who approaches them and  
do whatever they demand, or run across roads without looking first?   
Just how far does your faith in the inevitability of karma go?   
Your understanding of this subject is based upon few lines in some book, which  
may or may not be true, and as such is as good as no understanding at all.   
If it were not possible to overcome destiny, then there would be no hope of  
spiritual advancement at all, because such advancement is totally dependent  
upon defeating karma.
