**THE VEDANTA PHILOSOPHY AND CHRISTIANITY   
Volume 6, Lectures and Discourses  
**The Vedas are, in fact, the oldest sacred books in the world. Nobody knows  
anything about the time when they were written or by whom. They are contained  
in many volumes, and I doubt that any one man ever read them all.**   
The religion of the Vedas is the religion of the Hindus, and the foundation of  
all Oriental religions; that is, all other Oriental religions are offshoots of  
the Vedas; all Eastern systems of religion have the Vedas as authority.   
It is an irrational claim to believe in the teachings of Jesus Christ and at  
the same time to hold that the greater part of his teachings have no  
application at the present time. If you say that the reason why the powers do  
not follow them that believe (as Christ said they would) is because you have  
not faith enough and are not pure enough  that will be all right. But to say  
that they have no application at the present time is to be ridiculous.   
I have never seen the man who was not at least my equal. I have travelled all  
over the world; I have been among the very worst kind of people  among  
cannibals  and I have never seen the man who is not at least my equal. I have  
done as they do  when I was a fool. Then I did not know any better; now I do.  
Now they do not know any better; after a while they will. E **very one acts  
according to his own nature. We are all in process of growth. From this  
standpoint one man is not better than another.**

In Churches, when the priest addresses the listeners: "O sinners!",   
the faithful Christians who have come for the Sunday mass listen   
to the call meekly. Suppose after the Church mass is over   
and when one Robert comes out to the street and if I call, "O Robert!   
the Sinner!", he will immediately look at me sternly and quickly remove his  
shoes to beat me. This is because Robert believe that he is not a sinner and  
just because the priest said so, he had kept quiet.   
But Hinduism says everyone "You are the Being in happiness. Happiness is your  
birth right. You are the Atma. Your miseries   
will not touch your Atma. You are not born, nor are you going to die! You  
are eternal!"   
But the Western religions think otherwise. Wolter A. Keers says humorously: "....but if you live in London or Melbourne or Ottawa or Amsterdam, and you go  
to the baker early in the morning and you tell him, "Of course, I was never  
born!" and you repeat it to the green grocer and to a policeman and to a  
doctor, I'd like to see how long you still roam about free in the streets of  
such cities [without being locked up inside a police station or a lunatic  
asylum]...."   
We are happiness in our true nature. It is our ego which shrouds our  
happiness and give us miseries.   
Arunachala Siva.
