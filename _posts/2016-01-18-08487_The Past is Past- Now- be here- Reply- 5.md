Interestingly, while in Skandasramam, my sister remarked that the energy in  
the Cave began vibrating   
in a horizontal manner. In the Cave I remarked that the energy seemed to  
start vibrating in a vertical   
manner. In Virupaksha Cave, our experiences reversed with my sister feeling  
the energy vibrating vertically,   
with blue light, and myself horizontally. Except in these two instances, the  
force field vibrated in all directions,   
simultaneously.   
We remained in this force field for two days. As we drove away from  
Arunachala and back to Chennai,   
the force field gradually dissipated.   
Bhagavan Sri Ramana sang a song about Arunachala in his Eight Stanzas to Sri  
Arunachala, verse 1: Look, oh, great wonder! There it stands as of insentient. Mysterious is the  
way it works, beyond all   
human understanding. From my unthinking childhood the immensity of Arunachala  
had shone in my   
awareness, but even when I learned from someone that it was only  
Tiruvannamalai, I did not realize   
its meaning. When it stilled my mind and drew me to itself, and I came near, I  
saw that it was the   
Immovable, stillness absolute.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
