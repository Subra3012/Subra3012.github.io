Of late, devotee who visit the big temple must have notice one unusual thing,  
recently last month when i visited the big temple and bough Rs 20 ticket to  
visit the inner sanctum, the guards their halt and told only people with paper  
that have permission to enter are allowed, but many people who don't have  
papers are allowed, so i strongly protest this move   
1) In this case buying Rs 20 ticket is useless   
2) Their should block everyone without papers,this is not happening ?   
3) They should either allow as usuall to inner sanctum with those posses  
tickets or completely order a one system like those in Tirupati or at  
Srirangam temple.   
Thanks

Dear Aham Brahmasmi,   
I fully agree with you. The Big Temple has become more famous   
nowadays. During Bhagavan's times, it was not so crowded as   
it is today. Bhagavan Ramana went right inside the inner sanctorum   
and hugged the Siva Linga! Today with increase in population   
and governement controls, so many such mismanagement areas   
are there inside the Temple. I also go with Rs 20 tickets, but   
it is all the same. A full dharma darshan would be most welcome   
by everybody. Let us hope for better days.   
Arunachala Siva.
