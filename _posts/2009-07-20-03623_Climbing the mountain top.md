Dear Aham Brahmasmi.   
I have not done it. But people say: 1\. One has to start at the time of sunrise.   
2\. Choose a non windy, non rainy, sunny day.   
3\. Go via Virupaksha Cave/Skandasramam route.   
4\. Take water and some eats like biscuits / fruits.   
5\. Do not load your knapsack too much.   
You may take further minor details from Asramam inmates.   
Arunachala Siva.
