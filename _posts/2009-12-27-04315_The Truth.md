## Tiruppavai - 19  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 03, 2010, 04:47:21 AM

Today is the 19th day of Dhanur month, Margazhi and the 19th   
song of Tiruppavai of AndaL is sung in many homes.   
The songs 18,19 and 20 describe Nappinnai, one of Krishna's wives.   
I have given some details about Nappinnai under song 18.   
The song 19 reads: With stump-lamps burning around the room, and on a cot with   
four legs made of tusks of elephants, O Krishna you are still   
sleeping, keeping your broad chest (with flower garlands), on   
the breasts of Nappinnai. Will you not open your mouth and   
say a word? O Nappinnai, with beautiful eyes having lines of   
mascara, will you not wake your husband, in spite of the delay?   
You are not able to leave him even for a second. Is this act,   
adding to your glory? No.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Tiruppavai - 18  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 02, 2010, 09:48:50 AM

Today is the 18th day of Margazhi, Dhanur month and it is the   
practice in many Tamil houses and with Tamil knowing Sri Vaishnavas of  
Karnataka, to sing the 18th song of Tiruppavai   
of AndaL.   
This particular song reveals some hitherto unknown information.   
Krishna or Kannan is already married to one lady by name Nappinnai. Krishna  
is said to have 108 wives, (Vallabhacharya   
says the number is 16108!) and one among them is the Tamil   
girl Nappinnai. Nappinnai means a girl with lustrous jet black hairs!  
Beginners in Sri Vaishnava philosophy think that AndaL is one of   
Krishna's wives. Yes. But that is only in Sri Rangam - Srivilliputtur  
stories. There is no reference to AndaL in Srimad Bhagavatam   
or Sri Narayaneeyam. Some authors say that AndaL is   
Goda Devi. But there is no name of Godadevi either in these   
two books. But there is reference to Nappinnai. Srimad   
Bhagavatam says that Krishna married one Dravidian (!) (Blackie!)   
girl by name Nappinnai. So, Nappinnai, the brunette, is Goda Devi   
or AndaL, we should conlcude.   
He is of the strength of an elephant, and valorous shoulders   
that shall never retreat against his enemies. He is Nandagopa,   
the foster-father of Krishna. O Nappinnai, one with long jet black   
fragrant hairs, the DAUGHTER IN LAW OF Nandagopa, please open   
the door. All of Krishna's girl friends have come for bathing. The   
cuckoos perching on the Madhavi creepers are cuckooing, again and   
again. We are repeatedly singing the holy names of Krishna, your   
hubby. Please open the door with your bangle-tingling lotus like   
hands!   
The cuckoos are cooing. So this is already morning, after dawn.   
In the dawn, as per Manikkavachagar's Tiruvembavai, the cocks   
make sounds first. Then the red legged snarks give forth sounds.   
Then the conch shells from priests make sounds. Then only   
the late rising cuckoos make cooing. Here AndaL refers to cooing   
of cuckoos. Hence it is no more dawn but early morning.   
Nappinnai, the brunette, has only long jet black hairs. But her   
limbs are pinkish red like those of a doll. This is evident from the last  
sentence of the poem. Hence she is a Dravidian but fair complexioned!   
Arunachala Siva.

## Pageants in Sivananda Lahari - 1  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 03, 2010, 08:52:06 AM

I thought I should write something from Sivananda Lahari of Sri   
Sankara, in commemoration of Siva-Nataraja for Ardra Darsanam,   
that was celebrated in the Asramam on 1st January 2010. Nataraja   
is the most pictureous Siva image amongst the eight images of Siva.   
There are several interesting pageants in Sri Sivananda Lahari.   
The Verse 85 speaks about Siva's curious food, dress and adornment.   
Jaladhimathana dhaksho daiva patala-bhedhi   
 Na cha vana-mrugayayam naiva lupta praveena   
Achana kusuma bhusha vastra mukyam saparyam   
 Kathaya kathamaham the kalpayaneendhu moule   
O Lord, with crescent moon on the locks! Your food is   
poison, the dresses are the tiger's skin and elephant's skin.   
I am not capable of churning the ocean. I am not capable of   
breaking the netherworlds. I am neither having felicity to   
hunt wild animals. Nor a clever hunter, am I. How can I do   
pujas to you with suitable food, flowers, ornaments, and attire?   
Please tell me.   
The essentials for puja to gods are attire, ornaments, flowers,   
and food i.e. Naivedya. For Siva, clothes are tiger's and elephant's skin;  
the best serpents can be obtained only from nether worlds.   
The flower is moon that has to be procured by churning milky   
ocean. The food or Naivedya is poison, which again can be had   
only by churning the milky ocean. Sri Sankara is nonplussed   
saying how can he bring these items to Siva puja.   
Siva is a madcap. His dress and oranments and food are making   
him appear as a madcap. Saint Manikkavachagar sings: "I shall laugh at you, if you do not take me out of this trecherous   
body-consciousness. I shall call you a madcap who has skinned   
the tiger and elephant, takes poison and that one who lives in   
cremation grounds. You are the madcap ruling over this madcap   
with body-consciousness."   
I bow to You, the Lord of Hall of Consciousness,   
With a curved foot, O Chidambareswara! - says   
Kunchitanghristavam, a poem of hundred songs on the curved   
foot of Siva, by AruL Nandi Sivam.   
My wife on that early morning of 1st January 2010, offered her   
eyetex to make a mark on Siva's cheek and Sivakamasundari's   
cheek, so that evil eyes would not fall on her, from observers who are jealous  
of their beauty. The priest took the eyetex and made   
some marks to avoid evil eyes. I was telling my wife: " For Sivakama   
Sundari, she is beautiful, it is okay to fix a mark on her cheek.   
Why such a mark for Nataraja, with all these madcap make-up?"   
My wife said: "You do not know, unless handsome, how this   
Sri Vaisnava girl can love and marry this Advaita brahmin?   
Siva is an Advaiti, he is Siva-Consciousness personified. But   
Sivakama Sundari, is the sister of Narayana, therefore a Sri   
Vaishnavaite and from cowherd's caste. This is the first inter-caste marriage  
of the human civilization!"   
I am wondering how my wife could interpret in such a curious way,   
the marriage of Sivakamasundari and Siva Nataraja.   
Arunachala Siva.

## The Truth  
Author: rideforever         Date: December 27, 2009, 09:20:24 PM

In the West religion becomes fuzzy, a grey-area, a cloudy mystery. Like "oh  
ok, religion looks nice for you - I can see it makes you feel good - but it is  
not for me", or "Oh yes, well he was talking about Truth - it's a metaphor for  
... ".   
No. It is no metaphor. The Truth is the Truth. It is the Truth of your  
existence, it is the Truth of all existence, and when you see it you will see  
it within you not somewhere else. It is not that you look over Buddha's  
shoulder and say "oh I see what you are playing with". No. You will see it  
within you and know that it is the Truth.   
It is literally the Truth. Literally. There is nothing further, and you will  
know it to be so whe you see it within you.

Only the Atma is the Truth. The world, individual souls, personal   
gods are all imaginations. Truth has to be investigated by the   
seeker only. No books will help. No Guru will help. They will   
at best show the Way. You have to reach the Goal through that   
way, the way that you love most, and reach the Goal. Again,   
reaching the Goal does not bring about a halo around your face.   
You are what you are, but in Peace, the Peace that passeth understanding.   
Arunachala Siva.
