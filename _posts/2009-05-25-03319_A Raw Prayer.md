## A Raw Prayer

O, Ramana, why dont you call me to your place?   
Have I not ground myself enough?   
I am not able to hang around here!   
IF you will you can pull me like a magnet   
but you will not do,   
you would say, I am there, be there!   
But I cant see you here completely   
Can I not circumvent all this grinding,   
If you will?   
What can I do O Ramana, what can I do?   
Everything is in your hands only   
then what can I do?   
What Karma to work out? What Prarabdha?   
Take me back to where I came form, You   
Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?   
Rather me finding it out myself, O Ramana,   
you can show me that in a moment and fix me   
for you have told a Guru is a guide, Still   
why do you leave me alone?   
Nagaraj

DEar Nagaraj   
Sometimes I think, I do not have good guru to guide us. but If I stand even in  
front of Ramana He may think Oh God why I cannot have good deciple like  
Annamali swamy. I always think some thing is lacking in me only. In tamil  
there is one proverb, PATHIRAM ARINDHU PITCHAI IDU. If I go to ask Gyana  
pitchai in front of Bhagavan, He may be think twice because there is no  
worthful Pathiram.   
Anyway your prayer is very nice.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
No such despair. Nobody is worthless for Bhagavan Ramana.   
Again He is the Living Guru, and do not go in search of a   
guru in body. Many such gurus are boguses. Bhagavan Ramana   
sings in Arunachala Akshara Mana Malai, Verse 19: Please remove my mistakes/deficiencies, make my good in   
all respects, and then rule me as your servant, O Arunachala!   
He will take care. Our job is to only be faithful to Him, regardless of our  
mistakes/deficiencies which we can overcome   
by His grace in due course. EN KADAN PANI SEYTHU KIDAPPATHE....sang Tiru  
Navukkarasar.   
Arunachala Siva.
