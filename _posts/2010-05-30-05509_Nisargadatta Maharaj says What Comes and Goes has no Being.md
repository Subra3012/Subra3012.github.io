They alone live who live for others, the rest are more dead than alive.   
Whatever you think, that you will be. If you think yourself weak, weak you  
will be, if you think yourself strong, strong you will be.   
Faith in God, Faith in ourselves, this is the secret of greatness.   
How can we see evil unless it is in us?   
Only those who want nothing are masters of Nature.   
You cannot believe in God, until you believe in yourself.   
Everything can be sacrificed for truth, but truch cannot be sacrificed for  
anything.   
Seek the science of the maker, and not that of the made.   
Work on with the intrepidity of a lion, but at the same time, with tenderness  
of love.   
Impure imagination is as bad as impure action.   
Truth must have no compromise.   
Thirst for name and fame is the worst filth.   
There is nothing holier in the world than to keep good company.   
What we want is neither happiness nor misery; If the mind is pleased with  
praise, it will be displeased with blame.   
To work you have the right, but not to the result.   
The greatest sin is to think yourself weak.   
Dare to come to Truth even through hell.   
What we call nature, fate, is simply God's Will.   
Choose the highest ideal and live your life up to that.   
The whole ocean is present at the back of each wave.

Q: What is wrong with asking for help when the work is worthy?   
M: Where is the need of asking? It merely shows weakness and anxiety. Work on,  
and the universe will work with you. After all the very idea of doing the  
right thing comes to you from the unknown. Leave it to the unknown as far as  
the results go, just go through the necessary movements. You are merely one of  
the links in the long chain of causation. Fundamentally, all happens in the  
mind only. When you work for something whole-heartedly and steadily, it  
happens, for it is the function of the mind to make things happen. In reality  
nothing is lacking and nothing is needed, all work is on the surface only. In  
the depths there is perfect peace. All your problems arise because you have  
defined and therefore limited yourself. When you do not think yourself to be  
this or that, all conflict ceases. Any attempt to do something about your  
problems is bound to fail, for what is caused by desire can be undone only in  
freedom from desire. You have enclosed yourself in time and space, squeezed  
yourself into the span of a lifetime and the volume of a body and thus created  
the innumerable conflicts of life and death, pleasure and pain, hope and fear.  
You cannot be rid of problems without abandoning illusions.   
Q: A person is naturally limited.   
M: There is no such thing as a person. There are only restrictions and  
limitations. The sum total of these defines the person. You think you know  
yourself when you know what you are. But you never know who you are. The  
person merely appears to be, like the space within the pot appears to have the  
shape and volume and smell of the pot. See that you are not what you believe  
yourself to be. Fight with all the strength at your disposal against the idea  
that you are nameable and describable. You are not. Refuse to think of  
yourself in terms of this or that. There is no other way out of misery, which  
you have created for yourself through blind acceptance without investigation.  
Suffering is a call for enquiry, all pain needs investigation. Don't be too  
lazy to think.   
Q: Activity is the essence of reality. There is no virtue in not working.  
Along with thinking something must be done.   
 **M: To work in the world is hard, to refrain from all unnecessary work is  
even harder.**   
Q: For the person I am all this seems impossible.   
M: What do you know about yourself? You can only be what you are in reality;  
you can only appear what you are not. You have never moved away from  
perfection. All idea of self-improvement is conventional and verbal. As the  
sun knows not darkness, so does the self know not the non-self. It is the  
mind, which by knowing the other, becomes the other. Yet the mind is nothing  
else but the self. It is the self that becomes the other, the notself,and yet  
remains the self. All else is an assumption. Just as a cloud obscures the sun  
without in any way affecting it, so does assumption obscure reality without  
destroying it. The very idea of destruction of reality is ridiculous; the  
destroyer is always more real than the destroyed. Reality is the ultimate  
destroyer. All separation, every kind of estrangement and alienation is false.  
All is one -- this is the ultimate solution of every conflict.   
Q: How is it that in spite of so much instruction and assistance we make no  
progress?   
M: As long as we imagine ourselves to be separate personalities, one quite  
apart from another, we cannot grasp reality which is essentially impersonal.  
First we must know ourselves as witnesses only, dimensionless and timeless  
centres of observation, and then realise that immense ocean of pure awareness,  
which is both mind and matter and beyond both.   
Q: Whatever I may be in reality, yet I feel myself to be a small and separate  
person, one amongst many.   
M: Your being a person is due to the illusion of space and time; you imagine  
yourself to be at a certain point occupying a certain volume; your personality  
is due to your self-identification with the body. Your thoughts and feelings  
exist in succession, they have their span in time and make you imagine  
yourself, because of memory, as having duration. In reality time and space  
exist in you; you do not exist in them. They are modes of perception, but they  
are not the only ones. Time and space are like words written on paper; the  
paper is real, the words merely a convention. How old are you?   
Q: How can I become universal?   
M: But you are universal. You need not and you cannot become what you are  
already. Only cease imagining yourself to be the particular. What comes and  
goes has no being. It owes its very appearance to reality. You know that there  
is a world, but does the world know you? All knowledge flows from you, as all  
being and all joy. realise that you are the eternal source and accept all as  
your own. Such acceptance is true love.   
Q: It is not a matter of achievement, but of understanding.   
 **M: Don 't try to understand! Enough if you do not misunderstand. Don't rely  
on your mind for liberation. It is the mind that brought you into bondage. Go  
beyond it altogether.**   
What is beginningless cannot have a cause. It is not that you knew what you  
are and then you have forgotten. Once you know, you cannot forget. Ignorance  
has no beginning, but can have an end. Enquire: who is ignorant and ignorance  
will dissolve like a dream. The world is full of contradictions, hence your  
search for harmony and peace. These you cannot find in the world, for the  
world is the child of chaos. To find order you must search within. **The world  
comes into being only when you are born in a body. No body -- no world. First  
enquire whether you are the body. The understanding of the world will come  
later.**   
Q: What you say sounds convincing, but of what use is it to the private  
person, who knows itself to be in the world and of the world?   
M: Millions eat bread, but few know all about wheat. And only those who know  
can improve the bread. Similarly, only those who know the self, who have seen  
beyond the world, can improve the world. Their value to private persons is  
immense, for they are their only hope of salvation. What is in the world  
cannot save the world; if you really care to help the world you must step out  
of it.   
Q: But can one step out of the world?   
M: Who was born first, you or the world? As long as you give first place to  
the world, you are bound by it; once you realise, beyond all trace of doubt  
that the world is in you and not you in the world, you are out of it. Of  
course your body remains in the world and of the world, but you are not  
deluded by it. All scriptures say that before the world was, the Creator was.  
Who knows the Creator? He alone who was before the Creator, your own real  
being, the source of all the worlds with their creators.   
Q: Just as the waking state exists in seed form during sleep, so does the  
world the child creates on being born exist before its birth. With whom does  
the seed lie?   
M: With him who is the witness of birth and death, but is neither born nor  
dies. He alone is the seed of creation as well as its residue. **Don 't ask  
the mind to confirm what is beyond the mind. Direct experience is the only  
valid confirmation.**

Dear prasanth,   
Yes. Brahmasri Nochur Venkataraman says to the listeners of his   
sat-sangh.   
"Do not try to understand. Do not try to tell others you have understood.  
Just listen. Even if the mind does not capture it,   
the Heart will capture it at all times. All understanding with   
the mind in this world has brought about only wars and deaths.   
Do not try to take notes. These are secondary. Taking notes   
or trying to memorize a verse in Sanskrit or Tamil, are all   
mind's mischiefs. Once you start taking notes, the Heart will   
shut off its receiving. Once you memorize something, you will   
not read and realize its meaning in true sense."   
Arunachla Siva.
