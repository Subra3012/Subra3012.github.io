_A devotee asked how Garlic got that name. Sri Bhagavan replied, There is a  
curious story about it, and began telling the following story._   
AS IS WELL known, when gods (devas) and demons (rakshasas) churned the ocean,  
amrit came out of it. When the rakshasas were running away with the vessel  
containing amrit, the devas appealed to Vishnu. Vishnu came on to the scene in  
the shape of Mohini (enchantress), and offered to resolve their quarrel by  
serving amrit to them all. They agreed. While serving it to the gods first, it  
appeared that there might not be enough to go round for the demons. One of the  
latter got into the line of the gods, unobserved by Mohini, and was swallowing  
the amrit,when the Sun and Moon noticed it and gave her the hint. She threw  
the ladle, with which the amrit was being served, at the demon in such a way  
as to cut off his head.The ladle became the Chakra (an invincible lethal  
weapon of Vishnu) and cut off his head. But as the amrit had already gone down  
his throat, the head became a graha (planet) and has since been taking  
vengeance on the Sun and Moon at the time of an eclipse. That is the story.   
Now, when the head of the demon was severed, the trunk fell down, and in the  
process, a few drops of amrit fell on the ground. **It is said that those  
drops became the garlic plant.   
That is why it is said that garlic has some of the properties of amrit. It is  
very good for the body. But since it also has the touch of the demon, it has  
tamasic qualities too, which when eaten affect the mind. Hence, it is  
forbidden for sadhakas.**

Dear prasanth,   
That asura is Rahu. One who bothers the sun and the moon   
by causing eclipses.   
Garlic is accepted as a medicine. Even medicines [Ayurvedic and   
Siddha schools] prescribe Garlic for certain ailments. But it is not   
taken as a part of one's daily food, particularly by brahmins.   
It is said to intensify sexual impulses.   
Arunachala Siva.
