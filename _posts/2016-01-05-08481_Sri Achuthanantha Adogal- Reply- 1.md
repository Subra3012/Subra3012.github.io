In those days, at Kaspa near Vellore, there lived a learned Vaishnavite Saint  
called Venkatakrishna   
Dasar, who was poetically skilled and blessed, through his deep devotion, with  
the grace of the Lord.   
Abbaju, who was eager to have darshan of Sri Venkatakrishna Dasar, went to  
see him. Dasar was   
very pleased to see Abbaju and welcomed him warmly with a pleasant face.  
Abbaju spent a few days   
with him.   
During their discussions, Dasar was impressed by Abbaju's pure heart, bright  
appearance, clear knowledge,   
poetic gifts, refined intellect, and also his expertise in music and devotion  
to Lord Rama. Dasar told him,   
'Dear Sir, the Lord of Sri Lakshmi, always residing in my heart, gracefully  
commands that from today you   
shall be called by the wonderful name, 'Achutha Dasar'. Having received that  
graceful name, Abbaju   
reluctantly left Venkatakrishna Dasar with his blessings and returned to  
Polur to continue his normal   
life as a school teacher.   
After a few years, at the request of some of his respectable relatives, he  
married Thayammal of Kasthampadi,   
a virtuous and beautiful young girl belonging to a good family of the same  
caste and started living in her   
family house.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
