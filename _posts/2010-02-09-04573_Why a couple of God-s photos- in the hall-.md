## Why a couple of God's photos, in the hall?

Once a visitor (he is from United States), asked me: You have   
got a home altar, with a number of God's pictures. Apart from   
this, you have got a couple of God's photos in the hall too?   
Why so many photos? Is not one enough?"   
I asked him: "Where is your daughter now?" "She is at home   
only," he replied. Do you have her recent photo, I would like   
to see, since I have not seen her for quite some years." He   
became very happy and showed me her photograph in his wallet.   
He then showed his cellphone, where with each touch, several   
photographs of his daughter's photographs appeared on the screeen. He also  
said: "In my office, I have got her latest photograph on my desk and also on  
my laptop."   
I asked him: "Why so many photographs of your daughter?   
You are seeing her in flesh and blood everyday in the morning   
and in the evening at home. Why then, several photographs?"   
He smiled and changed the topic of conversation.

Very nice!   
A Photo is just a pointer its like saying : You are always with God!   
its needed coz we forget that God is with us, now!
