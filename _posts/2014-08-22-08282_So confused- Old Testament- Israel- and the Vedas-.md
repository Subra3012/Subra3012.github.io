Today is the Punarvasu Star Day of Aavani month. (Sraavana or Simha month).  
Today in the Asramam, there will   
be special pujas for Sri Ramanesara Maha Lingam. A golden casket is adorned on  
the Lingam. There will be special   
abhishekam, alankaaram and shotaso upasaram and arti. The noon meal will be  
having sweets etc. Today being   
Friday, there will be Sri Chakra Puja also for Yogamba.   
To remember this day we shall see one verse from Sri Ramana Sannidhi Murai of  
Muruganar: சீரார் வளம் சேர் சிவனே மற்றைத்   
 தேவர் எவராலும்   
தீராப் பிறவி தீரத் துடைக்கும்   
 திரு வெங்கடவோ   
பேராயிரம் சேர் பெருமான் உன்றன்   
 பேராப் பேரின்பம்   
ஆரா அமுதுக்கு ஆசைப் பட்டேன்   
 கண்டாய் அம்மானே.   
Opulent, prosperous Siva Himself,   
Tiruvenkata who has the power --   
The power that no God possesses -   
To end for ever the cycle of births,   
O Master with a thousand names,   
Listen and look how I am yearning for   
Your Bliss supreme, uncloying, changeless.   
Arunachala Siva.

This is the last verse of the treatise I am posting, additionally, which  
salutes the Lord Siva, who is consort of Ambika, Devi: Verse 44.52. of Ribhu Gita: தேசிகன் தெரிவித்த திறப் படி   
 தீரமாய் நிதித்தியாசம் புரிந்தால்   
ஈசன் நல் அருள் பெற்றவர் முத்தியை   
 எய்தலாம் என முன்பு விளம்பி மற்   
றேசிலா இந்த நூலின் மகத்துவம்   
 யாவும் ஓதி இதனை முடித்திடல்   
ஆசிலா ஆனந்த தாண்டவம் ஆடும் நம்   
 அம்பிகேசன் அகண்ட சொரூபமே.   
Arunachala Siva.

Mark/Friends,   
An excerpt from Ralph Waldo Emerson's Eassy on 'Self Relaince':  **Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist. He who would gather immortal  
palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it be  
goodness**. **Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind.  
Absolve you to yourself, and you shall have the suffrage of the world**. I  
remember an answer which when quite young I was prompted to make to a valued  
adviser, who was wont to importune me with the dear old doctrines of the  
church. On my saying, What have I to do with the sacredness of traditions, if  
I live wholly from within? my friend suggested, -"But these impulses may be  
from below, not from above." I replied, "They do not seem to me to be such;  
**but if I am the Devil 's child, I will live then from the Devil.**" **No law  
can be sacred to me but that of my nature**. Good and bad are but names very  
readily transferable to that or this; the only right is what is after my  
constitution, the only wrong what is against it. A man is to carry himself in  
the presence of all opposition, as if every thing were titular and ephemeral  
but he. I am ashamed to think how easily we capitulate to badges and names, to  
large societies and dead institutions[/b].   
The whole of this essay is full of wisdom,expressed in a spirit of Defiance  
and daring.You may read the complete essay here: http://www.emersoncentral.com/selfreliance.htm   
Namaskar

Mark/Friends,   
Here is another wonderful excerpt from Emerson's Essay on Self Reliance:  _There is a time in every man 's education when he arrives at the conviction  
that envy is ignorance; **that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself  
for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full  
of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil  
bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till**. The power  
which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is  
which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried._

Thank you all so much for your responses.   
I know at some point, I have to drop all this, for the good of my health, and  
I guess, the good of my spiritual being. I guess I can see to an extent, that  
I have been indoctrinated, if I had been born in India, I would possibly not  
be so attached to the popular story of Jesus Christs Cross. I also have come  
to note, that most of the quotes people use in the defense of Christ taking  
all our sins away, comes from St. Paul, and not directly from the four  
gospels.   
The story about the garden is fabulous, etymology is amazing. It really is a  
beautiful understanding of the garden, and the changing of words is  
fascinating.   
The other thing that strikes me in my being is that, I believe in God, and in  
Jesus Christ, yet I still am seeking and searching for something, I guess the  
Truth, which Christ said he was also, so if I am still seeking, Truth, I am  
still seeking Christ, which means it's not 'over', or rather, the popular  
understanding of 'washed away our sins with his blood' isn't as simple as  
saying 'OK' and then it's all done. You would think, if it was such a thing  
from God, that once you say it, and believe it, and understand it, that  
immediately it would bring the change within you, except things have been the  
same for 2000 years for the majority of the world, meaning we must have gotten  
something wrong.   
Oh deary, I think I need to find the rubbish bin for my mental baggage with  
all this, arghh! Haha, Ok, enough for now.   
Thank you all so much!   
Much love,   
God bless,   
Mark.
