## Swine Flu

We are seeing in the TV and also in press that Swine flu is fast   
spreading from Mexico to European, American and Asian countries.   
Swine is Varaha, the boar or the pig.   
My wife suddenly felt last evening that one can pray to Narayana   
and read two chapters of Narayaneeyam, Chapter 12 and 13,   
which describes the Varaha Avatara and Varaha vanquishing   
Hiranyaksha and saving the world. The story is also available in   
Srimad Bhagavatam, but I do not know the skandam and section   
numbers. She says that it will be a cure for swine flu sufferings   
for all the people.   
People who have got faith in this, can read these sections in   
Sri Narayaneeyam or Srimad Bhagavatam. It will work depending   
on one's faith.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Kaupina Panchakam by Sankara

Kaupina Panchakam, Five Verses on Loin-cloth, is a small   
poem of Sankara, which aptly describes Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi.   
A sample:-   
Witnessing the changes of the mind and body   
Naught but the Self within him beholding   
Heedless of outer, of inner, of middle,   
Blest indeed is the wearer of loin-cloth!   
Chanting Brahman, the Word of redemption   
Meditating only on " I am Brahman"   
Living on alms and wandering freely   
Blest indeed is the wearer of loin-cloth!   
Arunachala Siva.

In this Adi Shankara describes the state of advanced devotees who have  
surrendered to the ultimate reality and living with witnessing consciousness  
without the noise   
of the adjuncts.

Sri Adi Sankara says: Kaupina vantah kalu bagya vantah.   
Vedanta Vakyeshu sada ramayantah   
Bikshanna matrena tustimantah   
vishokamantah karane charantah   
kaupina vantah kalu bagyavantah   
Swami Suddhanada, samvit sagar trust [www.selfknowledge.in] wrote a book  
"Defining Austerity" which is a meditative indulgence into kaupina panchakam  
 an excellent book to read!   
Love!
