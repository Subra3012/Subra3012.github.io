Kaupina Panchakam, Five Verses on Loin-cloth, is a small   
poem of Sankara, which aptly describes Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi.   
A sample:-   
Witnessing the changes of the mind and body   
Naught but the Self within him beholding   
Heedless of outer, of inner, of middle,   
Blest indeed is the wearer of loin-cloth!   
Chanting Brahman, the Word of redemption   
Meditating only on " I am Brahman"   
Living on alms and wandering freely   
Blest indeed is the wearer of loin-cloth!   
Arunachala Siva.

In this Adi Shankara describes the state of advanced devotees who have  
surrendered to the ultimate reality and living with witnessing consciousness  
without the noise   
of the adjuncts.

Sri Adi Sankara says: Kaupina vantah kalu bagya vantah.   
Vedanta Vakyeshu sada ramayantah   
Bikshanna matrena tustimantah   
vishokamantah karane charantah   
kaupina vantah kalu bagyavantah   
Swami Suddhanada, samvit sagar trust [www.selfknowledge.in] wrote a book  
"Defining Austerity" which is a meditative indulgence into kaupina panchakam  
 an excellent book to read!   
Love!   
Silence
