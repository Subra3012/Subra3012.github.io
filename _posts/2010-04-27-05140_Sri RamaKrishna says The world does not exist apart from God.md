"It may be asked, 'How has Satchidananda become so hard?' This earth does  
indeed feel very hard to the touch. **The answer is that blood and semen are  
thin liquids, and yet out of them comes such a big creature as man. Everything  
is possible for God.**   
First of all reach the indivisible Satchidananda, and then, coming down,look  
at the universe. You will then find that everything is Its manifestation. **It  
is God alone who has become everything. The world by no means exists apart  
from Him.**   
" **All elements finally merge in akasa. Again, at the time of creation, akasa  
evolves into mahat and mahat into ahamkara.** In this way the whole world-  
system is evolved.It is the process of involution and evolution. A devotee of  
God accepts everything.He accepts the universe and its created beings as well  
as the indivisible Satchidananda.

Bhagavan Ramana says: The world is mental manifestations. The world is unreal. This   
is inititally for a seeker to meditate inward.   
After realization, the world and everything is Brahmaswarupam.   
Arunachala Swarupam. The world and Brahman become one.   
Arunachala Siva.
