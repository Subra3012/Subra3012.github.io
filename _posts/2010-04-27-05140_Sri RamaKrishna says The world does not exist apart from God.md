Devotee: "How can one recognize a holy man?"   
 **Rama Krishna: "He who has surrendered his body, mind, and innermost self to  
God is surely a holy man. He who has renounced 'woman and gold' is surely a  
holy man.** He is a holy man who does not regard woman with the eyes of a  
worldly person. He never forgets to look upon a woman as his mother, and to  
offer her his worship if he happens to be near her.   
The holy man constantly thinks of God and does not indulge in any talk except  
about spiritual things. Furthermore, he serves all beings, knowing that God  
resides in everybody's heart. These, in general, are the signs of a holy man."

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri RamaKrishna answers to the question "Is the world unreal"?

M: "Is the world unreal?"   
MASTER: "Why should it be unreal? What you are asking is a matter for  
philosophical discussion.   
"In the beginning, when a man reasons following the Vedantic method of ' **Not  
this, not this** ', he realizes that Brahman is not the living beings, not the  
universe,not the twenty-four cosmic principles. All these things become like  
dreams to him. **Then comes the affirmation of what has been denied, and he  
feels that God Himself has become the universe and all living beings.**   
 **" Suppose you are climbing to the roof by the stairs. As long as you are  
aware of the roof, you are also aware of the stairs. He who is aware of the  
high is also aware of the low. But after reaching the roof you realize that  
the stairs are made of the same materialsbrick, lime, and brick-dustas the  
roof.**   
"Further, I have given the illustration of the bel-fruit. Both changeability  
and   
unchangeability belong to one and the same Reality.   
 **" The ego cannot be done away with.As long as 'I-consciousness' exists,  
living beings and the universe must also exist. After realizing God, one sees  
that, it is He Himself who has become the universe and the living beings.**  
But one cannot realize this by mere reasoning.

"It may be asked, 'How has Satchidananda become so hard?' This earth does  
indeed feel very hard to the touch. **The answer is that blood and semen are  
thin liquids, and yet out of them comes such a big creature as man. Everything  
is possible for God.**   
First of all reach the indivisible Satchidananda, and then, coming down,look  
at the universe. You will then find that everything is Its manifestation. **It  
is God alone who has become everything. The world by no means exists apart  
from Him.**   
" **All elements finally merge in akasa. Again, at the time of creation, akasa  
evolves into mahat and mahat into ahamkara.** In this way the whole world-  
system is evolved.It is the process of involution and evolution. A devotee of  
God accepts everything.He accepts the universe and its created beings as well  
as the indivisible Satchidananda.

Bhagavan Ramana says: The world is mental manifestations. The world is unreal. This   
is inititally for a seeker to meditate inward.   
After realization, the world and everything is Brahmaswarupam.   
Arunachala Swarupam. The world and Brahman become one.   
Arunachala Siva.
