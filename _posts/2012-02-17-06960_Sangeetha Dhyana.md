## Meditate into higher consciousness  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: February 23, 2012, 08:43:11 PM  
---  
We live most of our life through three states of consciousness: waking,  
dreaming and sleeping.   
In the waking state of consciousness, we experience the world through the five  
senses through which we seek elevation and joy. If any one of the senses is  
missing, the entire dimension of that sense is lost. When you cannot hear you  
are bereft of the whole arena of sound. Similarly, when you cannot see you are  
deprived of all beautiful sights and colours. So, the sense is more important  
and much bigger than object of sense.   
The mind is higher than senses; it is infinite, with many desires but the  
capacity of senses to enjoy is limited. Greed wants more and more of sensory  
objects. Even though you can only enjoy a limited amount during a lifetime,  
you want all the wealth in the world.   
Giving too much importance to sensory objects leads to greed; giving too much  
importance to the senses leads to lust; and giving too much importance to the  
mind and its desires leads to delusion.   
We cling to mind concepts and want things to happen in a certain way. Thus,  
they impede us from perceiving infinite consciousness that is part of us. All  
mind senses are not bad; learn to discriminate and be aware of what is  
happening at all times so that there is clarity. This is the first step toward  
higher state of consciousness.   
In the waking state, you are constantly engaged in looking, eating, working  
and other pursuits. Sleeping state is where you are completely cut off and  
dull. Dullness and heaviness linger even after waking. The more you sleep, the  
duller you feel since much energy is expended in sleep. In the dreaming state  
you are neither asleep nor awake. Here, you neither feel at rest nor are aware  
of your surroundings.   
Higher state of consciousness is somewhere between the waking, sleeping and  
dreaming states. Here, we know we "are" but we don't know "where" we are. This  
knowledge I "am," but don't know "where" I am or "what" I am, is called Shiva.  
This state gives the deepest possible rest that one can experience. And you  
can achieve this through meditation.   
Meditation prevents stress from entering the system and also releases  
accumulated stress. With the assimilation of meditation into daily life, a  
higher, cosmic state of consciousness dawns within. Cosmic consciousness  
perceives the whole universe as part of oneself. Then love flows between us  
and the world, empowering us to overcome opposing forces and disturbances.  
Anger and disappointments become fleeting emotions.   
Higher state of consciousness will not suddenly happen one fine morning. The  
sapling of consciousness is within you -- nurture it through spiritual  
practices like meditation. Some coconut trees yield in three years, some in 10  
years. And those that are not nurtured never yield, they simply exist.   
Attaining higher states of consciousness demands no complicated strategy; just  
learn the art of letting go. The confluence of knowledge, understanding and  
practice makes life complete. When you grow into higher states of  
consciousness, you are no longer thrown off-balance by situations and  
disturbances. You become strong yet soft -- a delicate and beautiful  
individual capable of accommodating different values in life without  
conditions. As your consciousness opens and you get physically, mentally and  
spiritually elevated, life truly becomes worth living.

I love him O mother. Listen.

Dear Jyoti,   
Akka Maha Devi (the Elder sister Mahadevi) is a great Saiva saint and is one  
of the four great Veera Saiva saints. There is one book   
titled Speaking of Siva, by A.K. Ramanujan. Some of her verses are available  
in English there. Nice book.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Jyoti,   
Akka Mahadevi and other three other saints of Veera Saiva movement, lived  
almost in the same century (12 or 13 C.) Of the four   
Akka Mahadevi was the most virulent poetess and she always ridiculed menfolk,  
saying that Siva is the only Man. Purushottama.   
The advaita also accepts all jivas are only women. She prayed to Mallikarjuna  
of Sri Sailam in Andhra Pradesh, though she lived in   
Karnataka-Andhra border and spoke in Kannada. Her verses are vachanas - blank  
verses.   
Look at this verse: Not one, not two, not three or four,   
but through eighty four hundred thousand vaginas   
have I come.   
I have come   
through unlikely worlds, guzzled on   
pleasure and on pain. Whatever be   
all previous lives, show me mercy   
this one day   
O Lord white as Jasmine.*   
(* - Lord white as Jasmine is Mallikarjuna, Siva of Sri Sailam.)   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Jyoti,   
I mentioned about four great Veera Saiva Saints. They are Basavanna, Akka  
Mahadevi, Desi Ramayya and Allamma Prabhu.   
There are a number of verses from all the four. The complete English rendering  
is from one Prof. Hiremath. A.K. Ramanujan   
has rendered only a few verses from each. Prof. Hiremath's book, I am not  
sure, is now available.   
One more song from Akka Mahadevi: I have Maya for my mother in law;   
 the world for the father in law;   
 three brothers-in-law, like tigers;   
and the husband's thoughts   
are full of longing for women;   
no god; this man.   
And I cannot cross the sister in law.   
But I will   
give this wench the slip   
and go cuckold my husband with Hara*, my Lord (*Siva)   
My mind is my maid;   
by her kindness, I join   
my Lord,   
my utterly beautiful Lord   
from the mountain peaks,   
my Lord white as Jasmine,   
and I will make Him   
my good husband.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dea i,   
the life of Sarada devi, may generally get unnoticed before the Master, but,  
the life of Mother is very touching indeed, no matter your husband be a  
realised soul, really a very touching soul. She is the epitome of humbleness.  
in Tamil (தண்ணடக்கம் ) Thannadakkam.   
Has the Master anywhere said anything about, how does one get to know, if he  
has attained the truth. i am aware it may be a stupid question but, i have to  
ask... i am aware of Swayam Prakasha, Self knows, itself will know, it is its  
own illumination and so on... but, i feel, the Master has his knack of  
answering things like these... atleast quieten the mind thank you.

Nagaraj.   
We may say the other way round-that Sri Ramakrishna was fortunate to be the  
husband of a Realized soul!Sri Sarada devi's stature can only be understood  
when we are left wondering how Swami Vivekananda used to dip himself in the  
Ganges 6 times before approaching her.Swami Brahmananda will be overwhelmed  
and shiver with Divine emotion and approach her like a child and prostrate  
before her.These were Brahma Jnanis!Swamiji's chicago speech was a success  
because he wrote to Holy Mother seeking her blessings and she blessed her'  
Naren' -'May Saraswati reside in your tongue'!There are instances of persons  
not accepted by the Master reverting to our Holy Mother who accepted them  
unconditionally saying-'Ok,if he does not accept,do not go to Him!I am your  
Mother and you are my children!"   
More on our Holy Mother later.   
You asked about how Sri Ramakrishna answers that question of knowing Truth for  
oneself.Here is an excerpt from The Gospel: "After having the vision of God man is overpowered with bliss. He becomes  
silent. Who   
will speak? Who will explain?   
"The king lives beyond seven gates. At each gate sits a man endowed with great  
power and   
glory. At each gate the visitor asks, 'Is this the king?' The gate-keeper  
answers, 'No. Not   
this, not this.' The visitor passes through the seventh gate and. becomes  
overpowered with   
joy. He is speechless. **This time he doesn 't have to ask, 'Is this the  
king?' The mere sight of   
him removes all doubts**."   
PREACHER: "Yes, sir, it is so described in Vedanta."   
MASTER: "When the Godhead is thought of as creating, preserving, and  
destroying, It is   
known as the Personal God, Saguna Brahman, or the Primal Energy, Adyasakti.  
Again,   
when It is thought of as beyond the three gunas, then It is called the  
Attributeless Reality,   
Nirguna Brahman, beyond speech and thought; this is the Supreme Brahman,  
Parabrahman."   
This is the same as what Sri Bhagavan says in ulladu nARpadu -kandEn enru  
karuththezha villai,kandilEn enru karthezhumAren!   
There are more such exquisite sayings of sri Ramakrishna in The Gospel-He has  
this knack of making even a child of five to grasp and understand subtle  
truths through homely similies and parables.

Swami Vivekananda, Swami Brahmananda, themselves - if we have to look them we  
have to bend our neck upwards, and the kind of bhakthi and humbleness they  
showed towards mother is unfathomable.   
it is so beautifully explained, verily its same as Bhagavan says in ulladu  
nARpadu -kandEn enru karuththezha villai,kandilEn enru karthezhumAren!   
just silence... thank you..

Dear i,   
moreover, if we notice the lives of all great jnanis or realised sould, their  
autobiography ends here, at the point of entering the 7th gate or such a one  
utters his last real speech such as kandEn enru karuththezha villai,kandilEn  
enru karthezhumAren! these are the last ending words of every realised beings.   
Everything else that follows after this, is only a biography

**The Story of Sri Ramakrishna continued...**   
 **Summary of the Master 's Spiritual Experiences**   
We have now come to the end of Sri Ramakrishna's sadhana, the period of his  
spiritual   
discipline. As a result of his supersensuous experiences he reached certain  
conclusions   
regarding himself and spirituality in general. His conclusions about himself  
may be   
summarised as follows: First, he was an Incarnation of God, a specially commissioned person, whose  
spiritual   
experiences were for the benefit of humanity. Whereas it takes an ordinary man  
a whole   
life's struggle to realize one or two phases of God, he had in a few years  
realized God in all   
His phases.   
Second, he knew that he had always been a free soul, that the various  
disciplines through   
which he had passed were really not necessary for his own liberation but were  
solely for the   
benefit of others. Thus the terms liberation and bondage were not applicable  
to him. As   
long as there are beings who consider themselves bound, God must come down to  
earth as   
an Incarnation to free them from bondage, just as a magistrate must visit any  
part of his   
district in which there is trouble.   
Third, he came to foresee the time of his death. His words with respect to  
this matter were   
literally fulfilled.   
About spirituality in general the following were his conclusions: First, he was firmly convinced that all religions are true, that every  
doctrinal system   
represents a path to God. He had followed all the main paths and all had led  
him to the   
same goal. He was the first religious prophet recorded in history to preach  
the harmony of   
religions.   
Second, the three great systems of thought known as Dualism, Qualified Non-  
dualism, and   
Absolute Non-dualism - Dvaita, Visishtadvaita, and Advaita - he perceived to  
represent   
three stages in man's progress toward the Ultimate Reality. They were not  
contradictory but   
complementary and suited to different temperaments. For the ordinary man with  
strong   
attachment to the senses, a dualistic form of religion, prescribing a certain  
amount of   
material support, such as music and other symbols, is useful. A man of God-  
realization   
transcends the idea of worldly duties, but the ordinary mortal must perform  
his duties,   
striving to be unattached and to surrender the results to God. The mind can  
comprehend and   
describe the range of thought and experience up to the Visishtadvaita, and no  
further. The   
Advaita, the last word in spiritual experience, is something to be felt in  
samadhi, for it   
transcends mind and speech. From the highest standpoint, the Absolute and Its   
manifestation are equally real - the Lord's Name, His Abode, and the Lord  
Himself are of   
the same spiritual Essence. Everything is Spirit, the difference being only in  
form.   
Third, Sri Ramakrishna realized the wish of the Divine Mother that through him  
She should   
found a new Order, consisting of those who would uphold the universal  
doctrines   
illustrated in his life.   
Fourth, his spiritual insight told him that those who were having their last  
birth on the   
mortal plane of existence and those who had sincerely called on the Lord even  
once in their   
lives must come to him.   
In 1871 Mathur died, and some five years later Sambhu Mallick -   
who, after Mathur's passing away, had taken care of the Master's comfort. In  
1873 died his   
elder brother Rameswar, and in 1876, his beloved mother. These bereavements  
left their   
imprint on the tender human heart of Sri Ramakrishna albeit he had realized  
the   
immortality of the soul and the illusoriness of birth and death.   
In March 1875, about a year before the death of his mother, the Master met  
Keshab   
Chandra Sen. The meeting was a momentous event for both Sri Ramakrishna and  
Keshab.   
Here the Master for the first time came into actual contact with a worthy  
representative of   
modern India.   
to be continued....

**The Story of Sri Ramakrishna continued...**   
 **Brahmo Samaj**   
Keshab was the leader of the Brahmo Samaj, one of the two great movements  
that, during   
the latter part of the nineteenth century, played an important part in shaping  
the course of   
the renascence of India. The founder of the Brahmo movement had been the great  
Raja   
Rammohan Roy (1774-1833). Though born in an orthodox brahmin family, Rammohan   
Roy had shown great sympathy for Islam and Christianity. He had gone to Tibet  
in search   
of the Buddhist mysteries. He had extracted from Christianity its ethical  
system, but had   
rejected the divinity of Christ as he had denied the Hindu Incarnations. The  
religion of   
Islam influenced him, to a great extent, in the formulation of his  
monotheistic doctrines.   
But he always went back to the Vedas for his spiritual inspiration. The Brahmo  
Samaj,   
which he founded in 1828, was dedicated to the "worship and adoration of the  
Eternal, the   
Unsearchable, the Immutable Being, who is the and Preserver of the  
Universe". The   
Samaj was open to all without distinction of colour, creed, caste, nation, or  
religion.   
In Bengal   
and some other parts of India the Brahmo movement took the form of Unitarian   
Christianity, scoffed at Hindu rituals, and preached a crusade against image  
worship.   
Influenced by Western culture, it declared the supremacy of reason, advocated  
the ideals of   
the French Revolution, abolished the caste-system among, its own members,  
stood for the   
emancipation of women, agitate for the abolition of early marriage, sanctioned  
the   
remarriage of widows, and encouraged various educational and social-reform  
movements.   
The immediate effect of the Brahmo movement in Bengal was the checking of the   
proselytising activities of the Christian missionaries. It also raised Indian  
culture in the   
estimation of its English masters. But it was an intellectual and eclectic  
religious ferment   
born of the necessity of the time. Unlike Hinduism, it was not founded on the  
deep inner   
experiences of sages and prophets. Its influence was confined to a  
comparatively few   
educated men and women of the country, and the vast masses of the Hindus  
remained   
outside it. It sounded monotonously only one of the notes in the rich gamut of  
the Eternal   
Religion of the Hindus.   
 **Arya Samaj**   
The other movement playing an important part in the nineteenth-century  
religious revival of   
India was the Arya Samaj. The Brahmo Samaj, essentially a movement of  
compromise with   
European culture, tacitly admitted the superiority of the West. But the  
founder of the Arya   
Samaj was a pugnacious Hindu sannyasi who accepted the challenge of Islam and   
Christianity and was resolved to combat all foreign influence in India. Swami  
Dayananda   
(1824-1883) launched this movement in Bombay in 1875, and soon its influence  
was felt   
throughout western India. The Swami was a great scholar of the Vedas, which he  
explained   
as being strictly mono-theistic. He preached against the worship of images and  
reestablished   
the ancient Vedic sacrificial rites. According to him the Vedas were the  
ultimate   
authority on religion, and he accepted every word of them as literally true.  
The Arya Samaj   
became a bulwark against the encroachments of Islam and Christianity, and its  
orthodox   
flavour appealed to many Hindu minds. It also assumed leadership in many  
movements of   
social reform. The caste-system became a target of its attack. Women it  
liberated from   
many of their social disabilities. The cause of education received from it a  
great impetus. It   
started agitation against early marriage and advocated the remarriage of Hindu  
widows. Its   
influence was strongest in the Punjab, the battle-ground of the Hindu and  
Islamic cultures.   
A new fighting attitude was introduced into the slumbering Hindu society.  
Unlike the   
Brahmo Samaj, the influence of the Arya Samaj was not confined to the  
intellectuals. It was   
a force that spread to the masses. It was a dogmatic movement intolerant of  
those disagreed   
with its views, and it emphasized only one way, the Arya Samaj way, to the  
realization of   
Truth. Sri Ramakrishna met Swami Dayananda when the latter visited Bengal.

Today is Mother's Day: Apart from the Universal Mother, Mahadevi/Mahalakshmi/Mahasaraswati, how many  
Mothers have descended on this earth,   
to teach us the definition of Motherhood! Three Mothers come to my mind  
readily. There could be more. First is Mother Sarada   
Devi, the second is Mother Azhagamma and the third is Mother Teresa. Our  
humble pranams to these Mothers today!   
Arunachala Siva.

**Sri Ramakrishna and M-Master in Samadhi** (6)   
When the meeting broke up, the devotees sauntered in the temple garden. M.  
went in the direction of the Panchavati. _It was about five o 'clock in the  
afternoon. After a while he returned to the Master's room. There, on the small  
north verandah, he witnessed an amazing sight. Sri Ramakrishna was standing  
still, surrounded by a few devotees, and Narendra was singing. M. had never  
heard anyone except the Master sing so sweetly. When he looked at Sri  
Ramakrishna he was struck with wonder; for the Master stood motionless, with  
eyes transfixed. He seemed not even to breathe. A devotee told M. that the  
Master was in samadhi. M. had never before seen or heard of such a thing.  
Silent with wonder, he thought: "Is it possible for a man to be so oblivious  
of the outer world in the consciousness of God? How deep his faith and  
devotion must be to bring about such a state!"_   
Narendra was singing: Meditate, O my mind, on the Lord Hari,   
The Stainless One, Pure Spirit through and through.   
How peerless is the Light that in Him shines!   
How soul-bewitching is His wondrous form!   
How dear is He to all His devotees!   
Ever more beauteous in fresh-blossoming love   
That shames the splendour of a million moons,   
Like lightning gleams the glory of His form,   
Raising erect the hair for very joy.   
 _The Master shuddered when this last line was sung. His hair stood on end,  
and tears of joy streamed down his cheeks. Now and then his lips parted in a  
smile. Was he seeing the peerless beauty of God, "that shames the splendour of  
a million moons"? Was this the vision of God, the Essence of Spirit? How much  
austerity and discipline, how much faith and devotion, must be necessary for  
such a vision!_   
The song went on: Worship His feet in the lotus of your heart;   
With mind serene and eyes made radiant   
With heavenly love, behold that matchless sight.   
 _Again that bewitching smile. The body motionless as before, the eyes half  
shut, as if beholding a strange inner vision._   
The song drew to a close. Narendra sang the last lines: Caught in the spell of His love's ecstasy,   
Immerse yourself for evermore, O mind"   
In Him who is Pure Knowledge and Pure Bliss.   
 _The sight of the samadhi, and the divine bliss he had witnessed, left an  
indelible impression on M. 's mind. He returned home deeply moved. Now and  
then he could hear within himself the echo of those soul-intoxicating lines: Immerse yourself for evermore, O mind,   
In Him who is Pure Knowledge and Pure Bliss._

**Sri Ramakrishna and M-The Peacock and the Opium** (7)   
 **Fourth visit**   
The next day, too, was a holiday for M. He arrived at Dakshineswar at three  
o'clock in the afternoon. Sri Ramakrishna was in his room; Narendra,  
Bhavanath, and a few other devotees were sitting on a mat spread on the floor.  
They were all young men of nineteen or twenty. _Seated on the small couch, Sri  
Ramakrishna was talking with them and smiling.   
No sooner had M. entered the room than the Master laughed aloud and said to  
the boys, "There! He has come again." They all joined in the laughter. M.  
bowed low before him and took a seat. Before this he had saluted the Master  
with folded hands, like one with an English education. But that day he learnt  
to fall down at his feet in orthodox Hindu fashion_.   
 **The peacock and the opium**   
 _Presently the Master explained the cause of his laughter to the devotees, He  
said: "A man once fed a peacock with a pill of opium at four o'clock in the  
afternoon. The next day, exactly at that time, the peacock came back. It had  
felt the intoxication of the drug and returned just in time to have another  
dose."(All laugh.)   
M. thought this a very apt illustration. Even at home he had been unable to  
banish the thought of Sri Ramakrishna for a moment. His mind was constantly at  
Dakshineswar and he had counted the minutes until he should go again_.

Dear Ravi,   
Nice verse of Tirunavukkarasar. Smt. Kanakammal used to quote this in case of  
Sri Bhagavan. Sri Bhagavan right from His   
birth got fascinated by the name Arunachalam. (nAmam kEttAL). He thought that  
It must be somewhere quite big, and unreachable. Some relatives came to His  
house and told Him that he has been to Arunachalam. (Arur kEttAL) Shock  
waves spread over Bhagavan's body. He asked: Where is Arunachalam? The  
relative said that it is a great Siva Kshetram where the Hill is also called  
Arunachala.   
Bhagavan on hearing the details became a picchi. (picchi AnAL). Mad after the  
thought of going there. Finally from Madurai to Arunachala! He uttered a lie  
that He was going to Electricity Class and then pushed off to the Railway  
Station, taking the money given by Nagaswami for paying the fees. (AnRe  
Achrathai vittAL). In the parting note He did not even sign. (than nAmam  
kettaL)   
Arunachala Siva.

Top Ten Buddhism facts you should know**   
by Jaya   
http://www.bbncommunity.com/2013/09/18/top-ten-buddhism-facts-you-should-  
know-2/   
About 2500 years ago, Siddhartha Gautama, a prince likely to become king of  
several northern states in India, stepped out of his palace to see the real  
world. He was shocked to learn that the world, contrary to what he had seen  
inside the palace, was full of suffering. Siddhartha set out on a quest to  
find the truth and the permanent solution to sufferings such as death,  
disease, old age, etc. After many years, Siddhartha became the Buddha  the  
Enlightened One. Buddhism as a religion, practice or philosophy as you choose  
to call it, is based on his teachings. Listed below are top 10 Buddhism facts  
that you should know.   
 **1) Cause and effect is the universal law of universe**   
bbncommunity.comBuddhism recognizes Cause and Effect or Karma as the  
universal law. According to Buddhism, in the transient world, all humans  
receive good, bad or other outcomes according to the nature of their  
dispositions and actions. Heaven, in terms of Buddhist principles is the point  
when the mind of a seeker is freed from the Karmic cycle. It is the point at  
which a person masters himself. The mind, at that point, is like a tranquil  
ocean with no ripples of thoughts or emotions.   
2) Buddhism as a religion was born because of the Hinduism**   
bbncommunity.comSiddhartha Gautama was a Hindu prince by birth. He was born at  
a time when Hinduism, the oldest religion in the world, was in the grip of  
superstitions, caste-system and corruption in Vedic way of life. Siddha  
systems of learning had nearly vanished from the society. Gautama went on to  
find his own answers (which later become guiding principles of Buddhism)  
because Hinduism could not satisfy his urge for absolute truth. It is due to  
this reason that Hinduism and Buddhism, the two spiritual traditions of the  
East, are quite similar and dissimilar at the same time   
3) Its the 4th largest religion in the world**   
bbncommunity.comThe spread of Buddhism, as many people presume, is not limited  
to Tibet, Thailand & Sri lanka. There are well over 360 million people all  
over the world who practice and adhere to the teachings of Buddhism. The  
number is growing with each passing year as people in the West have begun  
taking deep interest in Buddhism, its teachings and rituals   
 **4) Buddha is not a god. He is a teacher.**   
bbncommunity.comBuddhists do not look up to Buddha as God, as most people  
think they do. Hes revered as a teacher or spiritual guide. Buddhists look up  
to Buddha for wisdom and guidance. Many Buddhists meditate upon Buddha to find  
their own answers or absolute wisdom.   
 **5) Buddhism does not teach that everyone in the world destined to  
suffer.**   
bbncommunity.comIt is a common misconception about Buddhism. The fact is: Buddhism accepts the world as temporary or transitory. Therefore, the  
suffering, too, is temporary and theres a way out of this suffering called  
the Middle Path. The whole religion or philosophy of Buddhism is based on it.   
6) Non attachment does not imply Buddhists cant have relationships.**   
bbncommunity.comWhen most people learn that monks and other Buddhists practice  
non-attachment, they simply presume that the religion has no place for  
relationships or a so called normal life. To be detached, in terms of  
Buddhism, is to be control of ones one self and be detached to everything  
happening in the world. If practiced regularly, this non-attachment can indeed  
help a person have the most fulfilling relationships.   
7) Buddhism compliments science**   
bbncommunity.comBuddhist principles and doctrines, like Vedic scriptures in  
Hinduism, complement science to a great degree. Over the last couple of years,  
many parallels have been drawn between Buddhist literature and findings in  
Quantum Physics. These parallels have, in particular, been drawn by  
considering spiritual principles of Buddhism that appear to indicate sublime  
truths now being discovered by quantum physicists.   
The next three facts we bring you are highly controversial matters. They have  
to be analyzed with the right mind set. We wish to bring you separate  
discussions on these three subjects as one may argue the authenticity of these  
three points. For an example we believe Buddhists should be vegetarians and  
there are enough evidences, facts and reasons to justify that Buddha was  
vegetarian himself. Besides, the doctrine clearly condition that eating meat  
does not fulfill the main percepts on Buddhism.   
 However we state this hoping that we can have a fruitful discussion later on  
these three subjects.   
 Reincarnation is a doctrine, not an absolute truth**   
bbncommunity.comA large number of people all over the world, especially those  
whove recently heard about Buddhism, think that it fully accepts the system  
of reincarnation. Yes, it is true, but its only partial truth. Its only a  
Buddhist doctrine based on the belief that energy or soul conditioned by  
experiences takes birth over and over again until its finally liberated. The  
higher truth propagated by Buddhism, however, is that a seeker should hold  
break free from all views or opinions about the world. The doctrine is, but  
a stepping stone to that point.   
 **9) Buddhists may or may not believe in god**   
bbncommunity.comWhile some Buddhists believe in God, others are agnostic. Yet,  
few others believe in demigods like Hindus do. Whether they believe in God or  
not, they make it a point to meditate on their own selves to find the higher  
truth, beyond an accepted belief. Like Hinduism or any other religion in the  
world, Buddhism, too, has a multitude of different traditions. Its in the  
core philosophy of Buddhism (e.g. Bhagavad Gita or Upanishads in Hinduism)  
that a seeker can truly rely on for wisdom and direction.   
10) Vegetarianism is not a commandment**   
bbncommunity.com   
Many schools of Buddhism preach non-violence and motivate all their students  
to turn vegetarians. However, the fact is  vegetarianism is NOT an absolute  
requirement or commandment for Buddhists. To eat or not to eat meat is a  
personal choice in Buddhism. A Buddhist can quit eating meat when he or she  
has a reason or feels an inner calling to do so. Buddhism strictly prescribes  
that no living being should be killed but it does not prohibits consumption of  
a naturally dead animal.

Subramanian,   
Yes,appar swamigal's tevaram reflects Sri Bhagavan's state of mind and how he  
came to Tiruvannamalai for good.In general,it also reflects how Divine Love  
manifests.

**LOOK AT YOUR THOUGHTS   
Otherwise, just sit and look at your thoughts. Let your mind do whatever it  
likes. Let it become as nasty as it wants! Let the mind tell you all kinds of  
things  scary things, happy things, wrong things, right things.   
The mind is only here to make trouble for you, that's all. But when you do not  
allow the mind to make trouble for you, it disappears! And how do you do this?  
By not reacting to your thoughts. By not allowing them to feel anything. Where  
do these thoughts come from? Nowhere. They are called   
false imagination. All thoughts are false imagination. False imagination is  
like the water in the mirage. That's where your thoughts are. They appear to  
come to you but they don't exist. If they were real you'd be able to grab  
them, hold on to them, save them, put them in a box, store them away. But   
you cannot do this, which proves that they have no substance. How can they  
frighten you?

Nothing more be elaborated. It is the essence of all the Gitas/Upanishads.   
The discussion on fate and free will will never be ending but instead of  
discussing if we use the above quote as a message for our own reflection  
during our daily meditation then we will understand the depth of it and accept  
life without much resistance.

Practice "Who am I?" constantly, continuously. "Who is this I that has this  
problem, this fear, this frustration? Where did the I come from?" As you keep  
separating yourself from the I daily, continuously soon you will not have to  
voice these things. It will be automatic. Whatever situation unveils itself,  
you will not say anything you will just look at it and smile and not be  
involved in it whatsoever. You will have risen to a higher consciousness, just  
by smiling at the condition, the situation. But if you are not practicing,  
then when a situation confronts you'll get angry, mad, upset, depressed and  
the rest.

**WHAT DO WE SEEK?**   
When I first came to Bhagavan and heard him repeating constantly that everyone  
must eventually come to the path of self-enquiry, I wondered whether he was  
being partial to his own teaching, but I soon understood why he insisted that  
this is so. The final goal is only oneness, and to experience oneness our mind  
must subside, which will happen entirely only when we attend to nothing other  
than ourself.   
So long as we attend to anything other than ourself, our mind cannot subside,  
because attention to other things sustains it, since that which experiences  
otherness is only this mind. When the mind subsides completely, only self-  
attention remains, and self-attention alone is the state of absolute oneness.  
Bhagavan used to repeat this teaching every day, maybe ten or twenty times,  
but still we didnt change. He didnt change his teaching either, because to  
him this truth was so clear.

Once in pachaiamman koil, Sri Bhagavan was there ans some monkeys were sitting  
around Him. He was telling the monkeys   
about Atma Vichara. Viswantha Swami who came that side, asked Bhagavan: 'Bhagavan ! You are teaching Atma Vichara to these   
monkeys. What will they understand?' Bhagavan smilingly replied: 'I am also  
teaching Atma Vichara, to you people. How many   
have you understood it correctly? So also these monkeys. Some will  
understand and some will not.   
Kavyakanta who was nearby laughed and laughed till his ribs might burst.

the Lord in spite of all   
the troubles met by him because he was one from the so called lower caste. The  
only hold he had   
throughout in all the hard times was the love, not an ordinary love to die off  
at the meeting of obstacles,   
a determined, pure, sincere love for the Almighty. While the real devotees  
like Sundaramurti Nayanar,   
who came in the Brahmin tradition and brought up like a king was looking  
forward to say, I am a slave   
to Tiru Nalaippovar, it is the people who do not digest the philosophy make  
the chaos. Imagining and   
feeling of Tiru Nalaippovar's dedication to Siva, in the kind of society he  
lived would be a kindler to   
conquer the hurdles and reach Siva.   
On the banks of river Kollidam, that sprinkles the water with its tidal hands  
onto the hands of the lotuses   
that lean up on both the banks to receive it in bloom, is the village Adhanur.  
In that fertile village was a   
slum that gave birth to the pearl by name Nandanar. The real affection only  
to the glorious feet of Lord   
Siva, peerless, disciplined in his profession were his characters. The simple  
devotee who knew only love, devotion, dedication to the Lord and nothing about  
ostentation, self-pride and worthless talk did the best   
of the service, he out of his traditional profession could do. He made the  
drums and parts of the various   
music instruments like Veena, Yazh, that are played in the worship of the Lord  
who chants the Vedas   
in the tune of Veena, when all the noises of the world have settled down. He  
offered the Korachanai,   
for the worship of the Lord of devas. (In the middle ages while the Supreme is  
praised that it is tradition-less   
(kulamili) people were differentiated by their birth with the caste system  
according to profession. The   
people of the so claimed lower hierarchy were refused entry into the temples  
of God. What a pity !   
When the Lord is worshipped as the Lord of all creatures from the worm that  
moves in the gutters to   
the superior celestial powers, how could one refuse a human being an entry  
into the holy abodes which facilitate enlightening the self and pave way for  
liberation - a basic requirement and ultimate goal of all   
the lives ! There would of course be distinctions in accordance with ones  
discipline but how could the permit   
be refuted to one to the Form of Mercy's abode just because of the birth ?   
This man of immense love for the Lord, which was probably not understood by  
anyone around other   
than that Lover Himself, would stand outside the temple wherever he finds one,  
chant, sing, dance   
and enjoy in that Glory that is Omnipresent. He wished to salute and serve the  
Siva Loka Nathan,   
of Tirup Punkur. With an immense interest to worship the God he came by the  
door side straight in front   
of the Lord's altar. The holy Bull that is in front of the Lord came in  
between his vision to the Lord as   
he had to stand outside the temple. The Lord Asutosha, the Easily Pleased,  
knowing the ardent love of   
this splendid simple devotee, showered Its grace by asking the Bull to move  
aside a little bit so that   
Nayanar, could see Him. He showed the world that it is the sincerity of  
devotion that matters to Him   
nd not the caste, creed or race. The differences are only in the crooked eyes  
of the human beings and   
not in Its graceful vision. For Him the so claimed higher caste, so called  
untouchable, a black, brown,   
white, blue, rich or poor, a male or female all the same and what matters is  
the love. The humble devotee   
who felt on the top of the world saluted, bowed down, fell down, prostrated.  
The poor devotee wanted to   
do whatever service he can possibly do to the Lord of Siva Loka. Looking at  
the bad state of the   
surroundings of the temple he with growing enthusiasm cleaned up and dug a  
nice pond. At the completion   
of service circumambulated the God and returned back to his place happily.   
This way he went to many of the Lord's abodes to salute and did whatever  
service he could. A wish to   
see the Blissful Dance at Tillai, came often in his mind. He won't sleep that  
night, in the dawn he would   
think he might not be able to go because of his so called low caste birth and  
wouldn't go. Still he never   
wanted to drop that thought, he would say, "I will go tomorrow". (Nalaip  
Povan) - hence he became known   
as Tiru Nalaip Povar). The tomorrows went on and on and he couldn't bear it.  
Finally he convinced himself   
to go to Tillai. Reaching the frontier of that holy place, he saw the smoke  
from the sacrifices that were   
being made and heard the sound of Vedas, being chanted. Scared to enter the  
town that appeared   
so holy with what he thought an inferior birth, he circumambulated the town  
many times and out of   
fatigue he slept there. How can the Lord who comes to us taking us as His  
slaves giving bliss, His sincere devotee who was longing to see His dance  
lying outside the town anxiously ? He came in the slave's dream telling him to  
enter through fire His holy abode.   
The Lord appeared in the dreams of the priests of Tillai, instructing the same  
to them. The fearful priests   
came to the devotee and told the Lord's saying. Feeling blessed the excellent  
devotee of the Lord whose   
love can never be charred by any fire entered the flame praising the Holiest  
of the holy things, His   
graceful feet. Nandhanar, came out amidst the shower of flowers by the  
devas, salutations of the priests   
of Tillai, rejoice of the devotees as a reverend sage to worship the Dancing  
Marvel. With the priests   
following, he saluted the tower of the Lord raising deer in His left, he  
entered fast the Holy abode. They   
all saw him entering the Cosmic Dancer's place and they saw only the Cosmic  
Dancer's idol. The   
Supreme which could not be stained by the blots of human manners took this  
sincere devotee in   
Its blissful Feet. Let the reverend wonderful devotion of Tiru Nalaip Povar  
Nayanar, because of which   
in spite of the mountain of hurdles, he reached the Lord, stay in the mind.   
Arunachala Siva.

Sri Soundarya Lahari, Verse 5, speaks about desires and annihilation of  
desires, kama, being used   
as a general Sanskrit term.   
Haristvamaradhya pranata jana saubhagya jananim,   
Pura nari bhutva purarimpumapa kshobhamanayat   
Smaro'pi tvam natva ratinayana lehyena vapusha   
Muninampyantah prabhavati hi mohaya mahatam.   
Sankara says that it was by performing puja to Mother, that Vishnu was able to  
assume the divinely   
alluring from of Mohini, that stirred so firm a mind as that of Siva, and  
created in him love for that form.   
In the context of the arousal of the desire in the Brahman to conduct the  
affairs of the world, that the Brahman and the Brahma-Sakti were spoken of in  
erotic terms as the Kamesvara and Kamesvari   
pair? Thus Kameswari is another name of Sri Kamakshi or Lalita.   
In the second part of the verse, it says: By prostrating himself before you,  
and obtaining your grace Manmatha acquired the form that Rati lapped up with  
her eyes, a form that is visible only to her.   
Why should Mother shows compassion to create desires, not merely desire for  
woman but also other   
worldly desires. The world is full of low, mediocre and high level of people.  
The lowly people   
will prefer only worldly desires, some money, a girl to marry and to build a  
flat etc., The mediocre   
will ask Mother to give him devotion, pilgrimages, enough money to do donation  
and other   
dharmas. Sri Kamakshi herself is said to have done 32 dharmas, like poor  
feeding, giving medicines   
to sick and needy, clothes and homes to the needy. Then finally, there are  
highly evolved souls   
seek from Mother nothing but liberation, no worldly desires. Here liberation  
is also due to desire for self-inquiry for the Self!   
So all these desires have to be fulfilled by Mother, by her compassion.   
Kunti requested Krishna to give only sufferings, so that she would think of  
Him constantly. How can suffering come to a person? Unless there are desires  
and angers? In one way, kama and krodha are all blessings   
from Mother!   
These descriptions indicate that without the help and her grace and  
compassion, anyone whoever   
he be, will stumble and fall. We should not think that we can achieve things  
on our own and   
we must remain humble always, seeking her grace.   
Bhagavan Ramana was self realized in Madurai house. He had to spend about 6  
weeks thereafter,   
before reaching Arunachala. These six weeks were like three years for Him. He  
knew that He   
was not for worldly life, education, job etc., But what can He do? He used to  
go to Madurai Meenkashi   
Temple and cry before the images of 63 Saiva Saints. He told before them: O  
Siva, why not   
you give me a life like one of these people? Sakti, Meenkashi in whose city,  
He got self realization,   
had to help Him to find a way too. The Saktinipatam, the descent of divine  
power, which had   
happened to cause Self Realization in His Heart, did show the way and also the  
means to come His   
Father's city, Arunachala.   
Arunachala Siva.

Bhava-bhakti or ardent devotion to Siva is the connecting string of all  
devotees of Siva in   
Periya Puranam. This devotion is displayed by devotees treating Siva as  
Father, Guru, Mother,   
Child etc.,   
Once Tiru Neela Nakka Nayanar and his wife went to Siva temple, for offering  
pujas. In the inner   
sanctum, when the puja was going on, Nayanar's wife saw spider crawling over  
the body of   
Siva. She felt that the spider would harm Siva, so she gave a long exhalation  
by bending towards   
the image to drive out the spider! Neela Nakka got angry with his wife since  
she had caused   
sacrilege to Siva, by mouthing out the breath, full of dirty air and saliva.  
He left her at the temple   
and came back home and closed the doors denying entry for his wife. In the  
night Siva appeared   
before him in a dream and said: Look at my body, excepting for the area where  
your wife breathed   
out air, in all other places, the spider had bitten me and it is all full of  
red scales! Nakka woke   
up and understood his wife's bhava-bhakti and her purpose. He came back to the  
temple and   
apologized to his wife, prostrated before Siva for the ill-treatment to his  
wife and both returned home.   
This intense devotion is nothing but Sarangati in a different form and this  
takes one closer to Godehad.   
Once there was a gentleman, I think, Ramaswami Iyengar in the Asramam, who was  
devoted to   
Bhagavan Ramana to such an extent, that he did not even mention His name.  
Once he saw   
a visitor addressing Bhagavan as Ramana. He went and slapped him. The  
visitor also understood   
the reason and apologized.   
Arunachala Siva.

Five thieves are ever ready to rob us. But if I depend on Bhagavan, He takes  
care of me. No one   
can try to rob Bhagavan or Christ for that matter. Many people have tried  
this trick on Bhagavan   
as well as Christ. Once spies came and said to him (Christ) and said: Teacher, we know that you   
teach the truth about what God wants people to do. And you treat everyone  
with the same respect,   
no matter who they are.   
Tell us, should we pay taxes to the Emperor or not?   
Jesus knew that they were trying to trick him. So, he told them: 'Show me a  
coin.' They showed.   
Then he asked: Whose picture and name are on it?'   
'The Emperor's'. they answered.   
Then he told them: "Give the Emperor what belongs to him. Give God what  
belongs to God"   
 \- Luke 20; 20-25   
 \- also, in Matthew 22.15-22 and Mark 12.13-17.   
Let the five thieves be there. But we have got a more powerful guard with us.  
The guard will take   
care of us and our job is to pay our devotion and respects to him and sleep  
peacefully!   
Arunachala Siva.

Narayanathu Prandhan was a Malayalee Jnani. He was called Prandhan, which  
means madcap.   
He used to wander all over the village saying: Manasile Ayilla, Manasile  
Ayilla. I have not   
got it in the mind, I have not got it in the mind! People used to make fun of  
him.   
One day, he started saying: Manasile Aayee. Manasile Aayee. I got it in my  
mind, I got it in my mind!   
At that time, his guru appeared before him and asked Prandhan: What is it,  
that you have got in your mind?   
Prandhan replied: I got it in my mind, that I cannot get it in my mind!   
His guru took Prandhan with him.   
Hrudaya cannot be captured by mind.

The Jiva and the language or words are all in the world of mind --  
Manomandala. It is all sound and   
words. Atma is in silence. There is no need to understand the words, the  
language. Many a times   
only sound is adequate. What does the sound OM, or AUM explain? It is  
according to one's own   
mind or the Self, the Heart.   
Prahlada was given atma-upadesa by Narada, when the child was in the womb.  
What language the   
foetus know? What words it can understand? It can at best understand only the  
sound.   
Bhagavan Ramana said only this. Summa Iru. No words, no sound, the total  
silence of the mind and   
the jiva by remaining in one's own Heart.   
Arunachala Siva.

In 1936, Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni, one of the foremost disciples of Bhagavan  
Ramana, merged   
with the Pure Space.   
Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni, was a person of multi-feceted talents and  
attainments in life. He was a   
great scholar in Sanskrit literature, an ashtavadani, a person who could  
attend to 8 jobs at the same   
time! He was a prolific writer and he has done intense tapas in  
Tiruvannamalai and other 30 centres   
in India! He lived in some place with just plaintain fruits skin, to continue  
his penance! He got the   
title Kavyakanta after a debate in Bengal. He was an exponent in Vedas and  
Vedic astronomy and   
astrology.   
Kavyakanta Ganapati was also a prolific Sakti upasaka. He had displayed  
supernatural powers due to   
this Sakti Upasana. One day, on a hot summer afternoon, when he chanted Sri  
Lalita Sahasranamam,   
rain drops fell on him, in Arunachala Hill.   
His association with Bhagavan Ramana dates back from 1907. On 18th November  
1907, he was   
given the famous upadesa from Bhagavan Ramana, i.e. to go into the Source of  
the sound of his   
mantra chanting. He went to Pazhani Swami and asked for the full name of  
Bhagavan Ramana.   
When Pazhani Swami said: He is Venkatarama Iyer, Kavyakanta started calling  
Him, as Sri   
Ramana Maharshi. And Bhagavan's name as Sri Ramana Maharshi, came with this  
naming by   
Ganapati Muni.   
Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni had many other interests. He was in Congress party  
for some years.   
He started a group called Indra Sabha to practice mantra-japa for the  
country's freedom   
and all round welfare. He compiled the famous Sri Ramana Gita, containing  
Bhagavan Ramana's   
teachings. He also wrote Sad Darsanam, a Sanskrit rendering of Bhagavan's  
ULLadu Narpadu   
and a commentary for that too in Sanskrit. Later Kapali Sastri wrote the  
commentary for   
Sri Ramana Gita, called Sri Ramana Gita Prakasa.   
Among Bhagavan's devotees, Sri Viswanatha Swami moved with Ganapati Muni  
closely, since he   
was also a Sanskrit scholar. Ramanatha Brahmachari also moved with him  
closely due to his   
Congress-connections. Of course, Kapali Sastri, Gajananan, Daivarata,  
Mahadevan [Ganapti Muni's son]   
were all his direct disciples. Smt Visalakshi was his wife and she had  
mastered Tara mantra, a Sakti Mantra and became famous for her own  
achievements in mantra sastra. She was in fact, one of the questioners   
in Sri Ramana Gita. She passed away earlier to Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni.   
One Guntur Suryakantam, has written a detailed biography on Kavyakanta  
Ganapati Muni, in Telugu.   
Sri Ramanasramam has brought out a small biography on Ganapati Muni, in  
Tamizh, by Dr. Krupanandan.   
One Mr. Natesan in Tiruvannamalai, has brought out the complete works of  
Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni   
in about 10 volumes. Sri Natesan passed away recently.   
Arunachala Siva.

**Mystery of God 's ways**   
Those who lead a householder's life should practise spiritual discipline; they  
should pray eagerly to God in solitude. (To Mr. Choudhury) God cannot be  
realized through scholarship. Who, indeed, can understand the things of the  
Spirit through reason? No, all should strive for devotion to the Lotus Feet of  
God.   
Infinite are the glories of God! How little can you fathom them! Can you ever  
find out the meaning of God's ways?   
Bhishma was none other than one of the eight Vasus, but even he shed tears on  
his bed of arrows. He said: 'How astonishing! God Himself is the companion of  
the Pandava brothers, and still there is no end to their troubles and  
sorrows!' Who can ever understand the ways of God?   
A man thinks, 'I have practised a little prayer and austerity; so I have  
gained a victory over others.' But victory and defeat lie with God. I have  
seen a prostitute dying in the Ganges and retaining consciousness to the end.

However much a bhakta may experience physical joy and sorrow, he always has  
knowledge and the treasure of divine love. This treasure never leaves him.  
Take the Pandava brothers for instance. Though they suffered so many  
calamities, they did not lose their God-Consciousness even once. Where can you  
find men like them, endowed with so much knowledge and devotion?

Guru Gita: There are some verses extolling the guru-bhakti and surrender. I am giving  
only English translations.   
Verse 178:- Having drunk to the full Brahmarasa and satisfied in the  
Paramatman, the Sages of   
realization consider Indra as a mere straw and then what to speak of ordinary  
kings of the   
world?   
Verse 179:- The seekers after libration should at all times develop Guru  
bhakti, because by following   
the path shown by the Guru, one attains the Supreme auspiciousness and the  
state of Kaivalya.   
Verse 180:- 'I am one and one alone without a second' \-- whoever thus  
practices constant meditation   
as a result of the advice of the Guru with a firm determination, need not take  
recourse to the forest for   
hard penances.   
Verse 189:- O Devi! this is the advice in the path of Guru-marga which is  
capable of bestowing Mukti. Therefore, Guru bhakti should be practiced by all  
with great devotion and faith.   
Verse 192:- One may be engaged in Siva Puja or deeply immersed in Vishnu  
Puja, but if he is   
without a knowledge of the Guru tattva, all his learning is a mere waste.   
Verse 193:- If worship of Siva is done without knowing the real nature of  
Guru, that worship is for   
the mere name's sake. My dear Parvati, it is like a lamp drawn on a paper  
[which will not   
light the house].   
Verse 194:- By the glory and efficacy of Guru-diksha, all your actions bear  
fruit. By the attainment of   
a Guru, one attains everything. One without a Guru is a mere fool.   
Verse 195:- Since on does not understand the nature of Siva and one's own  
Self by himself, one without a Guru can be said to be a mere animal, worm or a  
firefly.   
Verse 196:- Therefore discarding all kinds of contacts with people, by all  
possible means, giving up all comforts of the scriptures, one should depend on  
the Guru only.   
The Guru Gita thus shows what it means to surrender to a Higher Power. It puts  
in perspective Bhagavan Ramana's words: "Surrender appears easy because people  
imagine that, once they say with their lips 'I surrender'....., they can be  
free and do what they like. But the fact is that you can have no likes and  
dislikes after you surrender and that your will should become completely non-  
existent."   
[Devaraja Mudaliar, Day by Day, entry dated 2nd Jan 1946).   
Arunachala Siva.

In the world's philosophy, the greatest blunder was committed by Dascretes who  
said: I think, therefore I am!   
Nothing can be farther from truth than this. One does not become Real, just  
because he is thinking.   
One is Real and therefore he thinks. Even this thinking is not necessary to  
realize the Real, the Self.   
There are plants and animals, which do not think as we do, but they are Real.  
They know their reality   
within. They can not tell it outside, that is all.   
Arunachala Siva.

Ganapati's stone image can be seen in any towns or villages in Tamizh Nadu.  
There is no need for an elaborate temple. On the banks of rivers and tanks,  
under a banyan or peepul tree, one can see Ganapati. But there are some  
specific temples and shrines for Ganapati in Tamizh Nadu.   
Starting from Chennai, in the city, the temple in Tiruvallikeni near the beach  
of Bay of Bengal, is very   
popular. He is a quite powerful and popular deity that students throng him  
for good results after examinations.   
In Thanjavur town, there is a Ganapati deity, on the outer portal of a Devi  
temple. This deity is called High Court Ganapati! I believe there was some  
tussle between two groups of devotees as to where to place this deity and High  
Court gave a verdict to place it at the entrance of Devi Temple! Near  
Thanjavur, on the banks of Kaveri river, there is a village called Ganapati  
Agraharam, where there is a small but good temple for Ganapati. There were  
brahmins in the past who were doing fire sacrifices and were following  
exclusive   
Ganapati worship, called Gaanapatyam by Sankara.   
Down south, in Tiruchirapalli, on the vertical heaps of shelves of rocks,  
there is an exclusive Ganapati   
Temple, which is quite famous throughout Tamizh Nadu. This Ganapati is called  
Pillaiyar at the summit, or Uchipillaiyar. Uchi is summit. Pillaiyar means  
venerable son, son of Siva. On this Vinayaka Chaturthi day, lakhs visit this  
temple and have darshan and it is open almost 4 am to 11 pm at night. There  
are concerts, bhagavata pravachan etc., for 10 days.   
From the town of Tiruchirapalli, if one crosses Kaveri river, about 2 km from  
the famous Sri Rangam   
Temple of Narayana, there is a Devi temple called Tiruvanaika. Here the  
goddess Akhilandeswari is   
there. Siva is called Jambukeswara. This the temple for Water principle,  
among the 5 elements. Here, in front of Devi, there is an Omkara Ganapati  
shrine. This is quite popular. Devi was pacified when she was ferocious  
after the conquest of Mahishasura, by installing her son, Ganapati in front of  
her!   
Further south, there is the famous Tiru Navalur Ganapati. This is the deity  
which was prayed to by Nambi Andar Nambi, when he was young. Nambi Andar  
Nambi is the forerunner for Saint Poet Sekkizhar, who   
wrote Periya Puranam. Nambi wrote a poem of about 100 songs, covering all the  
63 Siva Saints in   
a crisp manner. He must have lived around 9th century AD.   
Deep south, near Karaikudi, there is again a famous Pillaiyar Patti Temple.  
This Ganapati is the family   
deity of Chettiars in and around Karaikudi and Sivaganga.   
In Mumbai, people speak the powerful deity of Prabha Devi Ganapati.   
Avvaiyar the famous Tamizh saint and poetess was a great devotee of Ganapati.  
She had written many   
verses on Ganapati. Ganapati lifted her up with his trunk, from his temple,  
and placed her in Kailash,   
when her mission in the world was over!   
Arunachala Siva.

Guru Gita: The Guru places the onus of finding the Guru on the young student himself. It  
urges the students to   
select a Parama Guru {a Brahma Jnani} out of the different kinds of gurus and  
offers him a rule   
of thumb to identify such a Guru.   
Suchakadi prabhedena guravo babudha smritah   
svayam samyak parikshyastha tattva-nishtam bhajet-sudhih.   
 (Verse 272)   
"Gurus are said to be of different kinds, called suchaka etc., The intelligent  
one, having himself examined them carefully, should resort to one who is  
established in the higher reality i.e., a Brahma Jnani, referred to here as  
Parama-guru."   
Yasya darsana matrena manasah syat-prasannata   
svyam bhuyat dhritissanih sabhavet paramo-guruh   
 (Verse 292)   
"He, by the mere sight of whom, the mind becomes clear [and receptive], and  
fortitude and peace   
arise [in the mind] by themselves is a Parama-Guru.   
{Look at Sri Ramana Gita. When Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni asked Bhagavan  
Ramana: 'What is the   
sure way to find one Guru as Parama Guru or a Brahma Jnani, or a Self Realized  
person?' Bhagavan   
[He was hardly 25 at that time, and He must have definitely not read Guru  
Gita, but He has said   
exactly the above characteristics for a Self Realized person.}

Madurai is a place, where the history has witnessed many an eventful  
happenings. In 3rd century AD,   
it is here that Saint Nakkirar found fault even with a Tamizh song composed by  
Siva Himself to the poor uneducated brahmin priest of the temple, and got into  
an debate with Siva himself. Siva cursed him to   
suffer in burns of fire and then Saint Nakkirar sought his forgiveness. The  
saint went to a nearby jungle and did his penance and was blessed by Skanda.  
There, he wrote the famous Tiru Murugatrupadai on Skanda.   
It was in 3rd century AD. In fourth century AD, Saint Manikkavachagar was the  
minister in Pandya   
Kingdom. He went to Tiruperundurai and spent all the king's money (given by  
the king) in building a   
temple for Siva. He got into many punishments from the king and Siva came to  
help him out and he embraced ascetism and went around Tamizh Nadu, singing the  
glory of Siva, in Tiruvachakam. In 6th century AD, Tiru Jnana Sambandhar, who  
is an avatara of Skanda, defeated the Jains in many types of competitions,  
cured the king, who was a hunch back and also suffering from colic pains. The  
king and the subjects then moved back to Saivism. In 7th century AD, Sankara  
came to Madurai.   
Later in the year 1896, Bhagavan Ramana attained Self realization, in this  
same city, where after he went to Siva in the temple, and prayed to him for  
giving a life like the Saiva saints of yore.   
Sankara was by this time 26 years old. He had a darsan of Meenkashi and  
Sundareswara. He composed his Meenkashi Pancharatnam here.   
1\. I prostrate to Meenakshi, the queen of Pandya kingdom, who   
shines brighter than 1000 suns, who has got red lips like 'kovai'   
fruits, who has got white pearl-like teeth, clothed in bright golden yellow  
robes,   
who is ever prostrated to, by Brahma, Vishnu and Indra, who has got feet which  
is the swarupa of   
all tattvas, philosophies, who is the ocean of ever-full mercy.   
2\. I prostrate to Meenakshi, the one with pearl-studded headgear, who has got  
a full-moon-like pleasant face, whose anklets make all the music of the world,  
while walking. I prostrate to her who is shining like a red   
lotus, which gives all welfare to the devotees, who is the daughter of  
Himavan, the king of Himalayas, who   
is ever prostrated to, by Lakshmi and Saraswati, and who is the ocean of ever-  
full mercy.   
3\. I prostrate to Meenakshi, who is the form of Sri Vidya, i.e. all mantras,  
who is the consort of Siva, who shines with the sound of Hrimkara mantra, who  
stays in the center of Sri Chakra, (the metal inscription   
of Sri Vidya mantra). I prostrate to her, the mother of Ganapati and six  
faced Shanmuga and who is the ocean of ever-full mercy.   
4\. I prostrate to Meenkashi, who is the consort of Sundareswara, Siva. I  
prostrate to her, the one who removes all the (worldly) fears and confers  
Jnana to devotees, who is emerald-green in color, sister of Narayana, the  
divine player of Veena and who is the ocean of ever-full mercy.   
5\. I prostrate to Meenakshi, who dwells in the Heart of yogis and Jnanis, who  
confers all super-normal   
powers, (Siddhis), who is fond of fragrant white flowers, jasmine. I pray to  
that sister of Narayana who is prayed to, by Narayana. I pray to her who is  
the Brahman, of form of sound in Space, who is above all the   
worldly beings, who is the purport of Mahavakyas of Upanishads, and who is the  
ocean of ever-full mercy.   
Arunachala Siva.

Chandikeswara was a brahmin. His poorvasrama name was Vichara Sarman. He was  
a pious   
Siva devotee, doing his rituals and meditation as of a brahmin. One day, he  
saw the cowherd,   
beating a cow, which had just then begot a calf and was very weak. Seeing the  
cowherd, he   
told him that cows should not be beaten. Then he decided to herd the cows  
himself. The cows   
belonged to various brahmins of Cheyur, the town to which he belonged. His  
father also   
agreed. Vichara Sarman then took the cows to the outskirts having grasslands  
and thick trees   
and plants and grazed the cows. The animals because of good feed and also  
seeing the   
brahmin loving them, started oozing out the milk on their own. They also gave  
a lot of milk to   
the owners at home. Once Vichara Sarma saw the cows oozing out milk and so he  
decided   
to do a Siva Puja in the jungle itself. He made a Siva Linga with sands and  
water, did oblations   
with milk and offered the jungle flowers and bhilwas that were available. One  
day, a townsman   
saw this and thought Vichara Sarma was wasting the milk intended for the  
owners. He complained   
to his father. The father next day came to the place, without Vichara Sarman's  
knowledge and   
found the cows pouring out milk on the Siva Linga. He became angry and kicked  
the milk pots.   
He also kicked the Siva Linga. He beat Vichara Sarman. The boy on seeing the  
blashphemy of his   
father in kicking the Siva Linga, took out his stick, which became an axe  
immediately, and cut   
off his two legs. The father fell down with huge cry and bleeding. Siva  
appeared before him   
and said: "Vichara Sarman, I have found your immense bhava-bhakti which has  
made you   
even to cut off the legs of your father. You can come to my Abode and be my  
guardian angel   
in the temples." He also raised his father from death. Vichara Sarman thus  
became Chandikeswara,   
the guardian angel of Siva temples. We can see even today, his shrine to the  
right of Siva Linga,   
near the outlet for the holy waters, milk and turmeric that are poured for  
oblations to Siva.   
The devotees should go to him and mark their presence to Chandikeswara. Siva  
also offered   
to give the food, flowers and clothing to Chandikeswara. That is why, the  
cooked rice and the flowers   
and clothing of Siva are used by priests to adorn Chandikeswara also. When  
the devotees go near Chandikeswara, they should not clap their hands loudly,  
as if Chandikeswara is deaf. They should spread their left palm and slowly  
place the three middle fingers of right palm, without making noise. Giving a  
thread from the clothes, which is the prevalent practice is also not correct.   
Chandikeswara's story happened in Cheyur, [Chey=Son], because Muruga stayed  
their with his   
army, while on his way to kill Surapdama and his brothers, who were demons.   
Arunachala Siva.

There is a small town called Suruttapalli, near Kanchipuram. There is a Siva  
temple there.   
Here Siva is in a different form, which is rare. Here He is lying like  
Mahavishnu, on the laps   
of Uma. The Puranic story goes that after consuming halahala poison, Siva  
became tired and   
was resting, keeping his head on the laps of Uma. This Siva temple also  
follows some different   
procedure. They place shadari [paduka] on your head and give you only spoons  
of water.   
No vibhuti. No breaking of coconuts.   
This Siva temple was renovated some years back, by Kanchi Kamakoti Math. When  
Kanchi   
Sri Chandrasekhara went to that temple, he composed a Sanskrit verse: "O  
Father!   
Please take rest. You have done something which even Vishnu could not do.  
You have driven   
out the fears of devas about the poison. Please wake up early and bless us  
all."   
Arunachala Siva.

Fear is due to the mind. For the one who has controlled the mind, there is no  
fear. If one like   
Bhagavan Ramana could kill the mind, he becomes the boldest human being in the  
world. We are the   
Third Eye of Siva, from where Skanda came out to kill the demons with whom   
even Brahma, Vishnu and Indra feared. Problem of liquidation? Why we should  
fear that?   
We are always with God. It is God who runs the show!"   
Saint Tiruvukkarasar sang: What is there to fear about?   
What things will erupt which can give fear to us? We have   
got the Panchaksharam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Adi Annamalai, the foothills literally, is a place that one see while  
circumambulating the Hill.   
Here there is a temple for Annamalai also. This is almost the plateu area,  
that is why it is called, Foot Annamalai.   
Venkateswara Sastrigal and his wife Salammal were staying there sometime in  
1946. When   
someone said about this to Bhagavan Ramana, He said: "Once on a giri  
pradikshina we were   
caught in the rain and we stayed the whole night in the temple at Adi  
Annamalai. It was then   
I HEARD THE SAMA VEDA CHANT.   
The Hill has got treasures inside, indeed!

Kanampulla Nayanar Guru Puja   
Karthikai \- Krittika Star Day: The Lord who cures the bonds of births apart from the diseases the body  
accumulates, that Great   
Lord's holy place is Irukku VeLur, presently called as "Pelur" (6-kms from  
Vazhappadi in   
Salem District). With its huge temple and tall tower calling the seekers from  
all over to come and   
get the relaxation under the Holy feet of Lord Siva with the consort  
Aramvalarthanayaki.   
Our Nayanar was born in that place, owner of limitless wealth, renowned for  
his peerless good   
principles. He had a great desire for the Lord who burnt the devas of desire  
like a piece of straw.   
He found that the feet of the Flawless Absolute is the real wealth. He further  
found the best feature   
of the wealth one can have - illuminating the abode of the Luminous Lord who  
has three lights as   
His eyes. Decorating His holy place with nice lamps, he used to worship the  
God with falling body   
in raising love, singing the endless fame of the Limitless Lord. With the love  
of saluting the Lord of   
Elements, that dances in the dais of Tillai, he went to Chidambaram. With his  
spring of devotion   
dancing in his heart to the rhythm of the dance of the Lord, he prostrated to  
the Great Lord. He then   
started living in Tirup Puliichcharam continuing his service of illuminating  
the place of the Lord.   
His holy service continued in spite of whatever hurdles he faced. He sold the  
household articles one   
by one and lit the lamps in the abode everyday with pleasant ghee. Then came  
the situation when   
there was nothing left in the house to sell ! He was not convinced to beg to  
somebody. That once   
prominent rich man, who was still wealthy with the never dying love for the  
Lord who conquered   
death, but had no money in hand, toiled to cut the straws(Kanampul) in the  
fields and sold it to others.   
With the money he got in return that blot-less famed devotee bought the pure  
ghee and burnt the   
lamps in the temple. One day he could not sell the straws he brought in spite  
of all his efforts. He had   
nothing else in his hand ! Still not withdrawn from the sacred service he  
undertook to do, he went   
ahead burning the straws to illuminate the temple. As the stacks of impurities  
gets burnt soon when   
the devotion for Lord Sankara enters, all the straws he had brought got over  
soon and he required   
more to illuminate the temple. That true lover of God unwilling to stop the  
service even that time, put   
his own hair in place of the straw and started burning it - burning the cause  
of the two types of deeds !!   
Our Love, the Lord, appreciating the flawless love of the Nayanar, Kanampullar  
sat in the place of Lord   
Siva, blissfully saluting Him. Let the strong rock like determined devotion  
with which Kanampulla   
Nayanar, started even burning his head for the lamp, stay in the mind.   
Seeing his great act, Siva took him to His abode.   
Arunachala Siva.

God always likes a person who is devoted to His devotees. Many saints in  
Periya Puranam,   
[e.g. Appoothi Adigal] prayed only to Siva's devotees, like Tiru Navukkarasar.   
Yazhapanar, a low caste violinist prayed only to Tiru Jnana Sambandhar and  
played his   
violin only for his songs. Bhagavan Ramana says in Verse 104 of Arunachala  
Akshara Mana Malai: Let me be a devotee of the devotees of the devotees,   
who listen to Your name with love!   
Please bless so, O Arunachala!

Chandikeswara was a brahmin. His poorvasrama name was Vichara Sarman. He was  
a pious   
Siva devotee, doing his rituals and meditation as of a brahmin. One day, he  
saw the cowherd,   
beating a cow, which had just then begot a calf and was very weak. Seeing the  
cowherd, he told   
him that cows should not be beaten. Then he decided to herd the cows himself.  
The cows   
belonged to various brahmins of Cheyur, the town to which he belonged. His  
father also   
agreed. Vichara Sarman then took the cows to the outskirts having grasslands  
and thick trees   
and plants and grazed the cows. The animals because of good feed and also  
seeing the brahmin   
loving them, started oozing out the milk on their own. They also gave a lot of  
milk to the owners at   
home. Once Vichara Sarma saw the cows oozing out milk and so he decided to do  
a Siva Puja in   
the jungle itself. He made a Siva Linga with sands and water, did oblations  
with milk and offered   
the jungle flowers and bhilwas that were available. One day, a townsman saw  
this and thought   
Vichara Sarma was wasting the milk intended for the owners. He complained to  
his father.   
The father next day came to the place, without Vichara Sarman's knowledge and  
found the cows   
pouring out milk on the Siva Linga. He became angry and kicked the milk pots.  
He also   
kicked the Siva Linga. He beat Vichara Sarman. The boy on seeing the  
blashphemy of his father   
in kicking the Siva Linga, took out his stick, which became an axe  
immediately, and cut off his   
two legs. The father fell down with huge cry and bleeding.   
Siva appeared before him and said: "Vichara Sarman, I have found your immense  
bhava-bhakti   
which has made you even to cut off the legs of your father. You can come to  
my Abode   
and be my guardian angel in the temples." He also raised his father from  
death.   
Vichara Sarman thus became Chandikeswara, the guardian angel of Siva temples.  
We can   
see even today, his shrine to the right of Siva Linga, near the outlet for the  
holy waters, milk and   
turmeric that are poured for oblations to Siva. The devotees should go to him  
and mark their   
presence to Chandikeswara. Siva also offered to give the food, flowers and  
clothing to Chandikeswara.   
That is why, the cooked rice and the flowers and clothing of Siva are used by  
priests to adorn   
Chandikeswara also. When the devotees go near Chandikeswara, they should not  
clap their hands loudly,   
as if Chandikeswara is deaf. They should spread their left palm and slowly  
place the three middle   
fingers of right palm, without making noise. Giving a thread from the clothes,  
which is the prevalent   
practice is also not correct.   
Chandikeswara's story happened in Cheyur, [Chey=Son], because Muruga stayed  
their with his army,   
while on his way to kill Surapadma and his brothers, who were demons.   
Arunachala Siva.

There is a small town called Suruttapalli, near Kanchipuram. There is a Siva  
temple there.   
Here Siva is in a different form, which is rare. Here He is lying like  
Mahavishnu, on the laps   
of Uma. The Puranic story goes that after consuming halahala poison, Siva  
became tired and   
was resting, keeping his head on the laps of Uma. This Siva temple also  
follows some   
different procedure. They place shadari [paduka] on your head and give you  
only spoons of   
water. No vibhuti. No breaking of coconuts.   
This Siva temple was renovated some years back, by Kanchi Kamakoti Math. When  
Kanchi Sri Chandrasekhara went to that temple, he composed a Sanskrit verse: "O Father!   
Please take rest. You have done something which even Vishnu could not do.  
You have driven out   
the fears of devas about the poison. Please wake up early and bless us all."   
Arunachala Siva.

I think reading and the extent of reading is also one's prarabdha. Reading is  
not a pre-requisite   
for Jnana. Sankara read formally everything, went to Govinda Bhagavad Pada and  
then got further clarifications. He was of course, an avatara, and therefore  
Jnana was already there. But still   
he followed a formal way. Bhagavan Ramana did not read much but got Atmajnana  
and then   
read a few books as and when devotees asked for clarifications. All Sankara  
Math pontiffs go   
through a formal learning of Vedas and Upanishads for about 8 years. It  
varies from Jnani to Jnani.   
Attaining Jnana without a formal reading, is of course, quite rare.   
Arunachala Siva.

In any Sadhana, concentration is the essence of success. If it is Puja,  
concentrate on the Puja,   
on the idol to whom you do Puja, concentrate on every flower that you offer,  
concentrate on the   
mantra you chant. Live in total concentration, till you offer Arti, place it  
on your eyes and complete   
the Puja.   
If it is mantra japa, do not count the mantras. If you do so, your mind will  
go only into the   
counting mathematics. Do it without counting, as far as practicable.   
If it is meditation, instead of mediating on Pure Space, try to meditate on a  
symbol, say Bhagavan   
Ramana's face or feet. Chant mantra within your lips and if any thought drags  
you out, you   
mentally imagine, that you are placing a flower on His feet and come back to  
the meditating   
mode.   
This is my practice.   
Arunachala Siva.

We have seen how certain devotees, apart from Sankara, have done Siva manasa  
puja of   
different kind. Today we shall see Appoothi Adigal's story, in Periya  
Puranam.   
Appoothi Adigal is a brahmin from Thingaloor, a village, near Tiruvaiyaru. He  
is a wealthy brahmin.   
But he was not interested much in meditation of Panchakshara or formal pujas  
of the idol in the home   
altar or in the temple. There is a Siva temple in that village where the Moon  
is said to have done puja   
for Siva, to remove his sin of showing special love only to Rohini on of his  
27 wives, [representing   
27 stars, the daughters of Daksha and Daksha had cursed him for his  
preferential treatment,   
in such a way that the moon became reduced in size.].   
Appoothi Adigal prayed only to Tiru Navukkarasar, the great Siva devotee, whom  
he had not even seen.   
He started distribution of water and butter milk in a place in Thingaloor, for  
all pilgrims and called it   
Tiru Navukkarasar Center. So also he named the food distribution center as  
Tiru Navukkarasar Center   
 He even called his house after the great saint. He named his two sons as  
Elder Tirunavukkarasu   
and Younger Tirunavukkarasu.   
When Tiru Navukkarasar went to Thingaloor for praying to Siva, he found to his  
surprise that the centers   
had been named after him. He also knew that he had never met Appoothi Adigal.  
He went in search   
of the devotee's devotee. He found him in a large house. Appoothi Adigal was  
surprised   
indescribably about the visit. He went and welcomed him, in great reverence.  
He gave him a nice   
seat, cleaned his feet and asked him to take rest for a while, before dinner.   
The dinner time came and the Saint took his seat. Appoothi Adigal called his  
son Elder Tirunavukkarasar   
to go the backyard and fetch a plantain leaf. When the boy went there, a  
serpent stung him and he   
rushed back to the kitchen, gave the leaf and then fell down black and blue,  
fainted and died immediately   
due to poison. The couple kept mum and placed the leaf. They were about to  
serve food when Tiru   
Navukkarasar asked the couple to ask their son also to sit with him for  
eating. The couple with great   
misery then told the Saint the truth. Tiru Navukkarasar told them not to  
worry and went to the place   
where Elder Tirunavukkarasu was lying dead.   
He started singing a Padigam [ten songs], which described the Siva's  
greatness, with each verse   
starting as, one, two, three and four. When he completed the 10th song, Elder  
Tiru Navukkarasu   
stood up and prostrated the Saint as if he were only in sleep!   
The devotees of Siva are equal to Siva Himself. Praying to Siva's devotees is  
more propitiating than praying to Siva Himself.   
This truth is also mentioned in Siva Jnana Bodham, Sutra 12.   
Bhagavan Ramana Himself sings in Verse 104 of Arunachala Akshara Mana Malai  
as: Anbodum un namam keL anbar tham anbarku   
Anbanaivida aruL Arunachala!   
Let me be the votary of the votaries of those who hear   
Thy name with love, Oh Arunachala!   
Arunachala Siva.

Guru Gita in verse 129, speaks as to how the Guru goes about his job of  
conferring the Self Knowledge   
to the disciple.   
"Karuna khadga-patena chhitva pasashatkam sisoh   
Samyogananda janakah sadgurusso'bhidhiyate."   
He who by the sword of his compassion cuts the eight-fold fetters of the  
disciple and [thus] gives   
birth to spontaneous bliss in him, is called the Guru.   
The eightfold fetters are said to be: hatred, shame, caste [social class],  
[commitment to] good   
culture i.e. asrama, [protecting one's] reputation i.e. maryadha, pride and  
egoism, [ahankara].   
All these are snapped by Guru, to make to realize what you are.   
Once Muruganar brought a big jackfruit. It was to give it to ashramites  
because that day was his   
mother's annual ceremony day. Bhagavan said: "O, you have not left this  
still. So, you have to   
perform sraddha. Where are brahmins? I am one Brahmin, [Bhagavan telling  
about Him!],   
Ramanatha Brahmachari and Viswanathan are there. We shall find the fourth  
one!" Muruganar   
shed tears and prostrated before Bhagavan! Bhagavan, nevertheless allowed him  
to distribute   
the jackfruit pieces to everyone on that day, lest it should go waste!   
Guru is the Self. It is Is. One without the second. There is nothing other  
than That. It is nirguna, blemishless, nitya, suddha. Where is compassion  
[karuna] coming from? Karuna is the Self's Grace.   
While the Self is one without second, you cannot separate Karuna from it,  
Grace from it. It is not   
only Sat, it is Chit and it is Ananda. Sat Chit Ananda. Siva is the Self and  
Uma is the Grace. Grace   
cannot be separated and counted as one more apart from the Self. Grace is  
always feminine.   
But she is concorporate with Siva. She is Ardhanareswari. Unnamulai and  
Annamalai is One   
within One. Christians name their girl children as Grace. No male is named  
Grace! But she   
is part of parcel of the male principle, the Purusha.   
Manikkavachagar sings: "You have come to stay in my Heart. But the Heart is  
oozing nectar of   
Grace." He says in Tiru Ponnoosal, the Decade of Holy Swing, a song that  
describes   
the swing-game of girls.   
Nanjamar kandathan, andatthavar nathan.... (Tiruvachakam,   
Tiru Ponnoosal, Verse 4)   
He is having a blue neck [due to halahala], he is the Lord of the gods, he  
lives in Uttarakosa Mangai, where the clouds touch the tall walls of the city,  
embedded with pearls and rubies. He stays in my Heart, with the mother of  
graceful words; he lives in the Hearts of all his devotees, oozing the nectar  
of grace; he vanquishes our birth. Let us sing his glories, O girls with  
bangles made of corals and conchshells, let us play the game of golden swing!   
(Source: Guru Gita - Eng. Trans. Divine Life Society, and an article in  
Mountain Path, April June 2009)

Adi Annamalai, the foothills literally, is a place that one see while  
circumambulating the Hill.   
Here there is a temple for Annamalai also. This is almost the straight square  
area, that is why   
it is called, Foot Annamalai.   
Venkateswara Sastrigal and his wife Salammal were staying there sometime in  
1946. When   
someone said about this to Bhagavan Ramana, He said: "Once on a giri  
pradikshina we were   
caught in the rain and we stayed the whole night in the temple at Adi  
Annamalai. It was then   
I HEARD THE SAMA VEDA CHANT.   
The Hill has got treasures inside, indeed!

always jumps out with the least provocation. BEING STILL

Surrender is the way. In the world every being is created and one becomes the  
food of others.   
Even human beings who are vegetarians have to kill the plants to eat food. A  
fly is eaten by a lizard,   
a cow by tiger, a tiger killed by a man etc., This chain continues ever and  
for ever. We can at best   
help the suffering beings to the extent possible. Suppose we save a deer from  
tiger, the tiger would   
look at us and ask: Who are you to prevent my food? We have no answer.   
Surrender to God or Guru is the best way. All things are done by one  
Parameswara Sakti. Our job is   
to stay away from thinking that I shall do this or do that.   
Arunachala Siva.

Meditating on Sunya: There is nothing wrong in meditating on the Space, the Akasa, which is also of  
the 5 elements.   
But meditating on the Space is difficult. When a child sees a large empty  
hall, to which his father   
has shifted, he will immediately look for certain of his dolls to be placed in  
such and such a place   
etc., If you see an empty sky on a new moon day, you will try to track stars  
if any. Meditating   
on empty Space, Sunya, as Buddhists call, might be difficult. But if one  
could could do that it   
is okay.   
Fixing a holy place or a holy name for your meditation is not an attachment.  
Perhaps this is One   
attachment, which will also go off in due course. Bhagavan Ramana says it is  
like a mud on your feet.   
When the mud dries up, it falls away on its own!   
But seekers definitely need an one point attention to begin with. One reason  
why Teravadis in   
Buddhism went for praying to the idle of Buddha, is the same case.   
Arunachala Siva.

Again, please do not think only the so called 'holy places' are holy. It  
could be even non spiritual place.   
For Mother Teresa,and later to Sister Nirmala, their foundation Nirmal  
Hridaya in Kolkata is the holiest   
place in the world. When Mother Teresa came back from Vatican after getting  
the acclaim of Sainthood,   
she said that Nirmal Hridaya is the holiest place for her and not Vatican.  
For Sikhs their book Granth   
Sahib is the greatest and not the Gurdwara per se. The place could be  
anything. Kanchi   
Chandrasekara Saraswati, on his birthday, slept almost all nights in the  
cowshed in Kanchi Math.   
He did not sleep in the Math premises or before the deity of Kamakshi-  
Chandramouliswara   
inside the Math. He slept there whenever he used to stay inside the Math  
without tour. You and I   
cannot sleep even one night in such a place. An army of mosquitoes due to  
cowdung and cow-urine,   
mud floor, smell of hay and cowdung. For him, that place was holier than  
anything else.   
Place need not be a Siva or Vishnu temple. It need not be even Arunachala  
Hill. It need not be   
Gangetic bank in Kasi. It can be as you consider it holy. You make the place  
holy and not the place   
as such. Since I have experienced that sublime holiness in Arunachala, I  
consider that Hill and town   
as the holiest, holier than Kasi and Kailash.   
There is a Tamil poem: Neerellam Ganga   
Nilamellam Kasi   
Oorellam Thillai   
Malaiyellam Annamalai.   
All waters are Ganga   
All earth is Kasi   
All places are Thillai, Chidambaram   
All hills are Arunachala.   
You only make it holy.   
Arunachala Siva.

Meiporul Nayanar: Karthigai Uthara Star Day.   
Chethi Nadu was one of the ancient kingdoms with the town thirukkovalur -  
where Lord Siva   
destroyed the demon Andhakasuran, the form of ignorance - as it's capital.  
That kingdom made   
its fame indelible in the history when the king MeiporuL Nayanar, whose life  
was an example of   
tolerance and doing good even to enemy, ruled it.   
He had his heart engaged in hailing Hara and hands in helping His devotees. He  
served them as   
the way they required, ruled the country with law and justice bringing peace  
to the country and   
devotion bringing peace to the minds of the people. His valor allowed no enemy  
to raise against the   
kingdom. He considered the wealth of loving the luminant feet of Lord Siva to  
be the greatest of all.   
The graceful form of the devotees made him do anything for them.   
Mutha Nathan was the king who made all futile efforts to win Meipporular in  
the battle-field. He   
finally realized that fox can't beat the elephant in the fight. As the sin of  
taking revenge went high   
in his mind, he started enjoying the rotton smell of crooked ways. He knew  
that the Meiporular   
salutes and serves the devotees smeared with holy ash and other great symbols  
of Lord Sankara.   
That spineless coward called Muthanathan wanted to exploit this superior  
quality of that devotee   
e covered his body with the holy form of devotees smearing ash, with matted  
hair, covered a knife in a book he held in hand, as the darkness coming in the  
shadow of light. He arrived in the dark night in the palace of Meiporular with  
his mind darker than the one outside. Thinking him as a devotee of the Lord,  
the guards at many doors on the way permitted him with salutations. When he  
arrived at the room where the king was sleeping with dreams too of serving the  
devotees, the personal guard of the king by name Thaththan told him that the  
king is taking rest and requested him to wait. But Mutha Nathan went ahead  
saying that he was coming from Himalayam to meet the king. Thaththan couldn't  
stop him as he was in the form of devotee.   
The queen who saw him immediately woke up the king. The king pleased instead  
of getting angry for   
being disturbed at his private place, bowed down as soon as he saw the form of  
a devotee. Mutha   
Nathan told him "I have got a rare Agama given by your God. I came to explain  
you that. So ask your   
wife to leave and we should be alone". The king with untainted heart asked  
his wife to leave, gave him   
a nice seat, sat over the ground and bowed down, to raise up in our hearts.  
The crooked enemy like   
opening the book, took the knife and pierced the body of the king and pierced  
himself into the gloom   
stricken Hell. Who won ? Even if he lost his life, it was Meipporular who had  
a firm belief that the holy   
form of devotees is the Truth and winning his place under the Graceful feet of  
God and won the hearts   
of the devotees inspiring them.   
Thaththan who doubted Mutha Nathan from the beginning leaped immediately into  
the room and   
raised his sword to kill the crooked. But Meiporular stopped him saying  
"Thaththa! He is one among   
us". Thaththan cried and asked him to order his duty. Meipporular asked him to  
guard the devotee   
of the Lord from others till he crosses the frontier. Unable to go against the  
word of his loving king   
Thaththan guarded the wicked to the frontier. Meipporular held his breath till  
Thaththan came back saying that Muththa Nathan crossed the frontier without  
any trouble. He praised Thaththan for his action   
and advised his court-men to uphold the good deed of loving the devotees and  
respecting the holy   
symbols of the Lord. The truthfulness of his love for the form of devotees led  
him to the Truth that   
dances in the great golden hall of Thillai. Let the greatness of Meipporular  
who guarded even the enemy   
who took his life in a crooked way, just because he was in the holy form of  
devotees, stay in the mind.   
Arunachala Siva.

David Godman, in one of his talks with some Westerner has said that it is  
quite rare to witness   
a person like Bhagavan Ramana who is both enlightened and saintly.   
I also agree with him. There are only two in my view where both saintliness  
and enlightenment   
were together. One is Bhagavan Ramana and the other is Chandrasekhara  
Saraswati   
of Kanchi Math. Both were extraordinary.   
There are many people who were enlightened but not saintly, at least, in  
outward behavior.   
Seshadri Swamigal and earlier Kaduveli Siddhar [about whom I wrote] were   
such types.   
There are many who are saintly in their disposition but not self-enlightened.  
There are numerous   
examples which I do not want to quote here.   
Arunachala Siva.

During Bhagavan Ramana's time, when they renovating Arunachaleswara Temple,  
they found a   
stone slab near the Siva Linga, and on removing it, they found a dark tunnel.  
They immediately   
rushed to Bhagavan and asked Him what to do. Bhagavan Ramana said: "Do not try  
to investigate   
the tunnel. Please close the stone slab, as it was before." Arunachala  
Puranam says that yogis,   
siddhas and jnanis who are living in the Hill as forms of bright lights, come  
through the tunnel,   
in their subtle bodies and pray to Arunachaleswara at night. Arachelogists  
have in fact found that   
the Hill is as old as the earth itself, geologically, say about 3 billion  
years old and is older than Himalayas.   
But if they try to dig it and find something, they would find nothing, since  
the treasures may not be   
visible to their biological eyes. Recently, some company took lease of the  
far-western portion   
of the Hill, and wanted to dig and take ferro-aluminum alloy ore. People in  
the villages nearby protested   
and the project was abandoned under a High Court Order. It is like Mackenna's  
Gold. Gold is there   
in the Appachian Mountains, but if any one tries to take it, they will not  
return alive.   
Arunachala Siva.

Nikeshepam or Treasure in the treasure of a Jnani, his   
Brama Jnana. This has to be transmitted to the disciple,   
who has got faith and conviction in him. Without this   
transmission of Guru, one cannot have atmajnana by one's   
own efforts unless he passes through several births, vide   
the starting verses of Viveka Choodamani.

One needs outside help, till we understand and arrive at that state of non-  
dualism.   
It starts from the womb. Suppose mother denies that the food she eats should  
not go to the   
child in the womb and the child should take care of its problem, can the child  
survive?   
Can you cure your stomach pain or cataract in the eye by meditating within?  
Don't you need a   
doctor outside? This outside help from God or Guru is called Grace. With  
people   
in the world it is called love or compassion.   
There is a story about Ribhu Gita, Tamizh translation, by Ulaganatha Swamigal,  
[Bhikshu Sastrigal].   
He completed Ribhu Gita, with no invocation song on God, no mention about God  
throughout the book! Nataraja wanted to teach him a lesson. As soon as he  
completed the book, he became blind.   
He suffered for a while. Then slowly he started praying to Nataraja of  
Chidambaram. Nataraja   
appeared in his dream, and told him: Have you become that great to write a  
book   
without seeking Vinayaka's help and my grace? Include an invocation song and  
also as a   
punishment, you add a song on me, at the end of each chapter of Ribhu Gita.  
Ulaganatha Swamigal   
dictated these songs and asked his disciple to write them out at the end of  
each chapter and   
then submitted the entire work to Siva Nataraja of Chidambaram and prayed. He  
got back his eye sight!   
This is mentioned graphically in Sri Ramansramam's book and also in the  
wonderful English verse   
translation by Dr. H. Ramamoorthy and Nome by Society for Abidance in Truth,  
SAT, California.   
Arunachala Siva.

Anaya Nayanar: Karthigai - Hastha Star Day: Anaya Nayanar is a great inspiring example for a person leading a very simple  
life reaching the   
highest state of yoga - getting the liberation and unification with the  
Almighty - just by the whole   
hearted-love for God. He is a devotee who worshipped the Lord with the music.  
He was born in the   
town Mangalam in the kingdom Menmazha Nadu. That land of forests which had  
the blended fragrance of jasmine, lily and many other flowers that attracted  
the crowds of bees, had the blessings of spreading   
the fragrance of Anayar's love for Lord Siva, his music of His praise and his  
seeing of God in his own surroundings.   
He was taking care of the cows of the village. Great are the cows that give  
five holy substances   
that are used to anoint the Lord! Great are the cows that are the embodiment  
of all the Dhevas!   
It is these cows that give the holy ash, the wealth of the devotees of the  
Lord. Anayar served only   
the God who dances with the ghosts by his words, body, mind and action. He  
took the cows everyday   
to the lawns outside the town. Like the God who gets satisfied with offer of  
any leaf or flower and   
gives coveted boons, the cows grazed well and produced a lot of milk under his  
supervision. He   
protected them from falling sick or falling prey to wild animals.   
His love flowed from his heart, to his blessed lips as a jet of modulated air  
to flow through the flute   
in his hand, spread over the entire forest and anoint the Lord. He selected a  
bamboo which had   
all the superior qualities that are said in the scriptures and made a flute as  
per the rules (song: 13   
Anaya NayanAr Puranam in Periya PurANam talks about the way flute is made). He  
played the holy   
 five letters of the Lord in the flute with the tune of seven swarams.   
On a blessed day, with his head ornated with flowers of fragrance, forehead  
full of holy ash that   
frightens the death, the ash smeared body beautified by a garland, with the  
flute and the staff took   
the cows for grazing. It was the season of arrival of monsoon greeted by the  
dance of the peacock,   
the song of the creepers swaying in the breeze. He reached the beautiful  
garden of Konrai flowers.   
The sight of the very Konrai flower reminded him of the merciful Lord who  
wears that flower.   
He could see only Siva there. Wherever he saw all the flowers appeared as the  
form of the Almighty.   
His mind could do nothing but meditating at that appearance. His thinking  
could do nothing but   
surfacing the His great love for God. He could do nothing but showing his  
inexplainable feelings   
through his flute. His feelings could do nothing but making the sound of the  
holy five letter in his flute.   
(Songs 24 - 28 in Periya Puranam show beautifully the technique of playing  
flute)   
It was the sound of bees singing; sound of slow wind in the bamboo forest;  
pleasant sound of dawn.   
Like the bees which hallucinate at drinking the honey in the best of flowers,  
the cow herd stopped   
chewing while grazing; the calves that had their mouth at the lap of the cows,  
stopped drinking milk;   
the dancing peacocks unconciously appear there; the bulls and wild animals bow  
down with bliss.   
Snakes fall unconcious on peacocks; Lions and elephants walk together; Deers  
dare to come with tigers.   
Wind doesn't blow fast; rivers and springs flow calm; clouds don't roar. That  
blissful music filled the   
heart of Devas and overflew.   
The music that won't be felt by the sinners was heard by the snake ring  
ornated ears of the Lord. That form of grace which recited the melody of  
Samavedha, came along with the mother of the universe without any sound of  
the crowds of Devas and Rishis to interfere with the music. That Almighty  
which loves the songs   
of the devotees told the devotee Anayar, "Stay with me in the same state".  
Through the flower flow that   
Devas showered on him, Anayar reached the place where the Lord dances in  
bliss. Let the dedication of Anayar's music to Lord and the love which made  
him see the omnipresent God in the world and stay   
with Him in bliss forever stay in the mind.   
Arunachala Siva.

The Hill within me is not leaving me today without writing to you. Now take  
holy names.   
There are innumerable names for Siva and Vishnu and Devi in Hindu pantheon.  
Each   
god has got 1008 great names for him or her. What is the holiest? It depends  
on your faith.   
For Saivites and Advaitis they prefer Om Nama Sivaya, which is Sthula  
Panchakshara,   
which has to be told to you by a guru. Vaishnavites have got Om Namo  
Narayanaya. You can choose anything that appeals to you. A simple name does  
not need any initiation. Bhagavan Ramana has said: Even if you say your own name or I,I, I, it will take you to quelling of the  
mind. He said Siva Siva   
to Annamalai Swami and Muruganar and to a Harijan who came to Him and asked  
Him to say something   
to do! He told His devotees not to change to any other name from what is  
already appealing to one or   
initiated by a guru. When someone said 'Can I shift from Rama, Rama to Ramana  
Ramana,' He asked: "Why? Are Rama and Ramana different?"   
Arunachala Siva.

The whole world is either Maya or Divine. It is Maya till you arrive and it  
is all Divine, once you have   
arrived. Each place is holy but some are holier than the rest. Take for  
example, God appears before   
you and say that you have to sacrifice one component of the body. Now I shall  
take both your eyes?   
Would you agree? You will say instead, "You told me to sacrifice only one  
component. I shall   
sacrifice my whole hair or whole of my teeth." At best, you will agree to  
sacrifice your two legs but   
definitely not the eyes. The whole body is important, but the eyes are the  
more important of them.   
There is a story in the Bible, which is told in a different context. A  
shepherd was herding 100 sheep,   
one was lost in the jungle. He was more worried about the lost sheep [Bible  
says it is lost lamb, any way], than the remaining 99 sheep. Now tell me, is  
the lost sheep more important than the remaining 99 or   
not?   
For me Tiruvannamalai is the holiest. I do not in fact, like to visit any  
other place. For some other   
it could be Sri Rangam. For some more, it could be Velankanni, or Tirupati.  
For my son, he says he   
would like visit only Angkor Vat, in Cambodia again and again. Why one is  
holier or more important   
for some one and not for some one else?   
Arunachala Siva.

God always likes a person who is devoted to His devotees. Many saints in  
Periya Puranam,   
[e.g. Appoothi Adigal] prayed only to Siva's devotees, like Tiru Navukkarasar.  
Yazhapanar,   
a low caste violinist prayed only to Tiru Jnana Sambandhar and played his  
violin only for his songs.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Verse 104 of Arunachala Akshara Mana Malai: Let me be a devotee of the devotees of the devotees,   
who listen to Your name with love!   
Please bless so, O Arunachala!

In sleep, god as a matter of grace, allows the prana, breath to continue,  
whereas the mind is   
temporarily under suspended animation. [ The prana goes in and comes out, so  
that others   
would not think that you are dead, this is god's grace].   
\-- Who am I?   
In dream, mind shows some mischief.   
In wakeful state, it is the mind which calls all the shots.   
In all three states, Soul or the Self or Brahman is ever present.

Dear Sadhak,   
I agree. However a Jnani can also accumulate sins unwittingly. For example,  
Bhagavan Ramana accidentally   
stepped on a bush containing bees. He immediately took the punishment by  
showing the leg so that bees   
could sting at it to their hearts' content. Similarly, while walking on the  
Hill, He might have stepped on   
ants, small reptiles etc., without knowing.

Adi Sankara and Tiru Jnana Sambandha: Adi Sankara lived after Tiru Jnana Sambandha. Tiru Jnana Sambandha's birth is  
roughly estimated   
around 6 Century AD. Sri Sankara has lived sometime in 7th Century AD. In Sri  
Soundarya Lahari,   
Sri Sankara has sung only about Tiru Jnana Sambandha. He calls him as Dravida  
Sisu, the   
son of Dravida land. Sri Kanchi Chandrasekara Saraswati also has said that  
this reference is about   
Tiru Jnana Sambandha. The dates mentioned above are rough estimates by Sri  
Neelakanta Sastri,   
in his book History of South India.

Chandikeswara: Chandikeswara was a brahmin. His poorvasrama name was Vichara Sarman. He was  
a pious   
Siva devotee, doing his rituals and meditation as of a brahmin. One day, he  
saw the cowherd,   
beating a cow, which had just then begot a calf and was very weak. Seeing the  
cowherd, he told   
him that cows should not be beaten. Then he decided to herd the cows himself.  
The cows belonged   
to various brahmins of Cheyur, the town to which he belonged. His father also  
agreed. Vichara   
Sarman then took the cows to the outskirts having grasslands and thick trees  
and plants and grazed   
the cows. The animals because of good feed and also seeing the brahmin loving  
them, started oozing   
out the milk on their own. They also gave a lot of milk to the owners at home.  
Once Vichara Sarma   
saw the cows oozing out milk and so he decided to do a Siva Puja in the jungle  
itself. He made a Siva   
Linga with sands and water, did oblations with milk and offered the jungle  
flowers and bhilwas   
that were available. One day, a townsman saw this and thought Vichara Sarma  
was wasting   
the milk intended for the owners. He complained to his father. The father  
next day came to the place,   
without Vichara Sarman's knowledge and found the cows pouring out milk on the  
Siva Linga.   
He became angry and kicked the milk pots. He also kicked the Siva Linga. He  
beat Vichara Sarman.   
The boy on seeing the blasphemy of his father in kicking the Siva Linga, took  
out his stick, which became   
an axe immediately, and cut off his two legs. The father fell down with huge  
cry and bleeding.   
Siva appeared before him and said: "Vichara Sarman, I have found your immense  
bhava-bhakti which   
has made you even to cut off the legs of your father. You can come to my  
Abode and be my guardian   
angel in the temples." He also raised his father from death. Vichara Sarman  
thus became Chandikeswara,   
the guardian angel of Siva temples. We can see even today, his shrine to the  
right of Siva Linga, near   
the outlet for the holy waters, milk and turmeric that are poured for  
oblations to Siva. The devotees   
should go to him and mark their presence to Chandikeswara. Siva also offered  
to give the food, flowers   
and clothes to Chandikeswara. That is why, the cooked rice and the flowers and  
clothing of Siva are   
used by priests to adorn Chandikeswara also. When the devotees go near  
Chandikeswara, they should   
not clap their hands loudly, as if Chandikeswara is deaf. They should spread  
their left palm and slowly   
place the three middle fingers of right palm, without making noise. Giving a  
thread from the clothes,   
which is the prevalent practice is also not correct.   
Chandikeswara's story happened in Cheyur, [Chey=Son], because Muruga stayed  
their with his army,   
while on his way to kill Surapdama and his brothers, who were demons.   
Arunachala Siva.

There is a small town called Suruttapalli, near Kanchipuram. There is a Siva  
temple there.   
Here Siva is in a different form, which is rare. Here He is lying like  
Mahavishnu, on the laps   
of Uma. The Puranic story goes that after consuming halahala poison, Siva  
became tired and   
was resting, keeping his head on the laps of Uma. This Siva temple also  
follows some different   
procedure. They place shadari [paduka] on your head and give you only spoons  
of water.   
No vibhuti. No breaking of coconuts.   
This Siva temple was renovated some years back, by Kanchi Kamakoti Math. When  
Kanchi Sri   
Chandrasekhara went to that temple, he composed a Sanskrit verse: "O Father!  
Please take rest.   
You have done something which even Vishnu could not do. You have driven out  
the fears of devas   
about the poison. Please wake up early and bless us all."   
Arunachala Siva.

Varatunga Rama Pandyan, was a later period chieftain, with the suffix name of  
Pandyan. While   
he was in his death bed, his wife asked him whether he was afraid of death.  
The poet-king replied: Why should I be afraid, my dear wife?   
I am seeing Siva's abhaya hand.   
I am seeing his bracelets with wreathed serpents.   
I am seeing his waist cloth made of tiger's skin.   
I am seeing his red matted locks with crescent moon.   
I am seeing his golden feet with nicely sounding anklets.   
I am seeing his grace-emitting divine face.   
I am seeing his three starry eyes.   
I am seeing his neck with the dark poison mark.   
I am seeing his sacred thread, which are again snakes!   
I am seeing his forehead with vibhuti in three lines.   
I am seeing his pick axe and the fire on his hands   
I am seeing the slender-waisted Uma on his left.   
I am seeing the white total form of Siva, Pal Vannan.   
Where is the fear for me?   
Why should I be afraid?   
If every devotee could see such god's divine form, without   
any thought of dying, such vision alone should take him to   
the god's abode, without fail.

I shall write about one stray Tamizh verses. Most of us know Guru Namasivaya  
who was the disciple   
of Guhai Namasivaya. Both Guru Namasivaya and Guhai Namasivaya were living in  
Arunachala and has   
sung many songs on Arunachaleswarar. These have been published by Sri  
Ramanasramam.   
Guru Namasivaya has also sung some stray verses. He once went to Chidambaram  
to have darshan   
of the Dancing God of Golden Court, Nataraja in Chidambaram. Upon seeing  
Nataraja he sang: O Siva who gives boons to devotees everyday without fail, I shall make one  
request to you. You are   
ever dancing keeping your gunchitapatam, raised. While your left foot is ever  
raised, to protect the   
devotees, your right foot is ever stamping on Apasmara, Muyalakan, the demon.  
Are you not getting   
tired like this, for ever keeping one raised foot and keeping the other foot  
stamping on the demon?   
Why not you stop and take rest for some time?   
The perennial dance, Anavarata Tandavam can never stop. If it stops, the  
universe will cease to exist,   
with everything becoming a cosmic dust. And a new kalpa has to start. Even  
though the illustrious   
poet knows this, he sang out of compassion for the restless Siva. The ever  
dancing Siva, is Achala in Tiruvannamalai and the Mother who was watching His  
dance in Chidambaram, has merged into Him, as Ardhanari, in Tiruvannamalai.  
See Bhagavan Ramana's Navamani Malai verse 1.   
"The Non-moving Siva dances [moves] in Chidambaram in his cosmic dance, while  
Achala, the   
Mother, Sivakamavalli is watching. He is Achalan, the Non moving with Mother,  
Achalai. merging   
into Him and that is Arunachala, please understand!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Panguni Uththiram: Today is the Panguni Uththiram star day. This day is famous for gods also.   
1\. Only on this day, Siva married Parvati in Himalayas.   
2. Muruga on this day, married Deivayanai in Tirup Param Kundram. After killing the three brothers   
who were demons and who were giving many many troubles to Gods, Indra was  
happy to give his   
daughter Deivayanai in wedding to Muruga.   
3\. On this day, Maha Vishnu took Sri Devi on his right chest.   
4\. On this day, Brahma took Saraswati on his tongue.   
5\. On this day, Indra took to the hands of Indrani.   
In Muruga temples and Siva temples, this day is celebrated as the wedding day  
of these gods.

The question we need to ask is: what is the most important thing that we need  
to do with our lives?   
Leave aside the duties of supporting and raising a family. Leave aside the  
necessity of earning a living.   
The most important duty we have to ourselves is to be true to our nature, our  
"swadharma",   
and this at whatever the cost for who does not agree with Thoreau's  
observation that, "Most men lead   
lives of quiet desperation and go to the grave with the song still in them."   
Bhagavan Ramana did not encourage people to renounce the world. He advised  
dispassion and   
questioning of the assumptions we automatically make ourselves and others. We  
lead for the   
most part a mechanical existence whether we are aware of it or not. We take  
our opinions from   
newspapers and TV news channels. What Bhagavan Ramana advised was  
discrimination   
between what is eternal and what is ephemeral.   
We should be wary of an easy escape by thinking that we can do nothing.  
Thoreau said: "As if you could kill time, without injuring eternity!" Time is precious.  
Bhagavan's daily routine   
was fixed by the clock. He would go for days without speaking and yet the  
asramam would be   
unaffected because there was a discipline and purpose to each activity, which  
gave the day   
momentum and meaning. In the midst of activity Bhagavan sat in silence and  
moved as if alone.   
There was a solitude to Him which was impervious to the round of events. He  
was the Sun   
around which the devotees spent their days and thoughts. His constant and  
unfathomable   
abidance in, for want of a better word, what we call the Self, was a source of  
joy and awe for   
those who were open to its manifestation. The few words He spoke, the small  
amount of literature   
He wrote, were all cherished for nothing was wasted. Each word was meant,  
each gesture had   
significance. One wonders what Thoreau would have made of an encounter with  
Bhagavan.   
One imagines Thoreau would have found in Bhagavan the answer to his search for  
meaning and in a   
face to face encounter words would have been discarded. For Thoreau wrote: "Could there a greater   
miracle take place than for us to look through each other's eyes for an  
instant?"   
During his last years, Thoreau suffered from incurable tuberculosis, and  
slowly faded away over a number of years. But he was writing articles for  
journals even in bed as an invalid. When his aunt asked him: "Whether he had made peace with God", Thoreau replied: "I did not know we had  
ever quareled!"   
Among his last dying words were: "Now comes good sailing!"   
Let us leave Thoreau the final word: "It is not what you look at, that  
matters, it is what you see."

W.E. Channing who was a close friend of Thoreau and his first biographer,  
commented after his   
death that, "No man had a better unfinished life." For what are we to make of  
a man with great   
talents who apparently loafed his way through life? One of the most memorable  
statements of   
Thoreau concerned this very issue, "If a man does not keep pace with his  
companions, perhaps   
it is because, he hears a different drummer. Let his step to the music which  
he hears, however   
measured or far away." [Thoreau's Walden].   
Here was a person who in the face of social and peer pressure resolutely  
'listened to his inner call'   
and fulfilled his 'swadharma', not as someone who visibly accomplished  
something in the world,   
but one who walked on the woods and observed the beauty and precision of  
nature. "I went to the   
woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts  
of life, and see if I could   
not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I  
had not lived."   
His insights and lucid descriptions have inspired generations of writers too  
numerous to list here.   
Thoreau's example challenges us to ask what then does it mean to lead a  
fulfilled life in which all   
one's virtues and skills are exercised to the limit of human possibility? Is  
it in the accumulation of   
wealth, social power and respect by one's peers? Is it in doing good deeds  
and helping the less   
fortunate?   
So the question here is why so much as how. How can we lead a simpler life in  
this day and age   
with its superfluity of impressions, desires and fears brutally shoved into  
our faces by inane electronic equipments in our homes as well as at work? We  
do have a choice and it is not necessarily a radical   
one of renouncing the world and living in association with an ashram or  
similar institution. Our daily   
life is composed of small choices over which we have some degree of control.   
We do have choice whether or not to switch on a television, we have a choice  
and can say no when   
offered the latest gadget which will make us the envy of our friends. Even in  
situations, where we have   
no manoeuvre, we still have a choice whether to indulge in despair or anger,  
or remain calm.

Today is the liberation day of Amarneethi Nayanar.   
He was giving coupina and towel to the sadhus. That was his job. Once Siva  
came as an old   
brahmin and told him, that he would leave the spare coupina with him and go  
for a bath.   
On coming back, he would take the spare coupina. When He returned after bath,  
He asked   
for the coupina which was missing due to Siva's trick. The merchant  
Amarneethi told him that   
he would give Him a new coupina. Siva refused to accept. He then told Siva  
that he would give   
any amount of gold and diamonds. He brought them all and weighed them. These  
were not sufficient.   
He then stood himself and his wife and kid on the balance. Even then they  
were not sufficient.   
Suddenly the old brahmin appeared as Siva and took them to Siva lokam!   
Day of liberation - Aani month, Puram star day.   
Arunachala Siva.

Siva is said to be the greatest Mukunda-priya. Hari (Narayana)   
is said to be the greatest Siva Jnani. They merge in jnana-bhakti.   
Sri Sankara brings this idea in Verse 82 of Sri Sivananda Lahari.   
Banatvam vrushabhatvam artha vaphusha bharyatvam- arya pathe,   
Gonitvam sakitha mrudhanga vahata chetyadi rupam dadhou   
tvatpade nayanarpananja krutavan tvadeha bhago hari,   
pujyataras sa eva hi na cheth ko va dadhanyodhika   
O the concorporate of Ambika! Hari because of his having become an arrow for  
you, having   
become a bull as a vehicle, with half of your body as wife (Ardhanareeswara),  
having been a   
boar, a girl-friend, and a drummer became the most lovable for you. He has  
also donated his   
eye for you. He is also a part of your Hari-Hara form. Because of these, he  
becomes adorable   
by all devotees. Who is a greater than Hari in this world?   
#   
arrow - in Tripura Samhara, Hari became the arrow for Siva's bow.   
bull - in the same Tripura Samhara, Hari became the bull,(as   
a vehicle), when Siva's chariot-wheel broke.   
#   
wife - in Hari-Hara avatara, Hari is the wife of Hara (Siva).   
Saint Tirunavukkarasar sings: "Where is the wife for you, O   
Siva, without Hari?" Hari and Parvati are brother and sisters.   
Hari and Parvati are said to be the same principle.   
boar - in Arunachala Puranam, it is said that Hari (Vishnu) went   
as a boar to dig the earth to see Siva's feet.   
girl-friend - sakita - When the milky ocean was churned and when   
Siva was called to take the poison, Hari came as Mohini, the seductive girl.   
 (Srimad Bhagavatam).   
drummer - in the Pradoshakala Natya, when Siva dances, the drummer is Hari.   
donating the eye - During a puja by Hari to Siva, it so happened,   
one lotus (out of 1000 lotuses) became less. The lotus eyed   
Narayana, submitted his eye in lieu of lotus. There is a temple   
in Thanjavur District of Tamizh Nadu for Siva, where he is called   
Hari Netrarpaneswarar. Siva, for whom Hari submitted his eye, in puja.   
Arunachala Siva.

Verse 89 of Sri Sivananda Lahari is again a beauty.   
Nathibhir nuthbhis thavmeecha bhuja-   
Vithibhir dhyana samadhibhir na thushta   
Dhanusha musalena chachmabhir vaa   
vadha the preetikaram dhatha karomi.   
O the Ruler of the Worlds! By bow and arrows, pounding logs,   
and stones, you become very happy. You do not even become   
so happy, even with namaskarams, stotrams and pujas and dhyana   
samadhis. Kindly tell me by which you shall have maximum   
satisfaction. And I shall do accordingly.   
Siva became happy when Arjuna hit Him with his arrows and He   
gave him Pasupatastra. In the story of Sakkya Nayanar, who did puja to Siva  
Lingam,   
by throwing stones at it, He became pleased and conferred him liberation. Sri  
Sankara   
adds here the pounding log also, as Nindastuti.   
Tayumanavar sings: By throwing stones, and hitting you with   
arrows, and throwing some green leaves, your devotees reached   
the shore. I am lowly without any devotion, what can I do to   
get your grace, O the Guru, who supported the non-injury to others   
as the first qualification to reach you!   
Arunachala Siva.

1. One can be without mind, that is, mind permanently curling up in the Self. This is the no-mind state.   
2\. Mind when not outward pointed permanently, it is said to curl up in the  
Self. It is like the   
moon on the high noon.   
3\. Every activity of all living beings, is due to God's engineering and the  
living being's vasana.   
A terrorist also kills a group of people out of God's engineering, but it is  
his vasana which has   
thrust him that work. Sri Ramakrishna used to say to Kali. Thum Yantri Ami  
Yantra.   
You are the operator and I am the machine.   
Okay, why God instead of keeping quiet, should engineer the living beings?  
The answer is: Who am I question Him? Among the million spermatoza, one unites with ovum and  
causes fertility.   
Why this particular one, among the millions? Who chooses? God.   
Why should He? Who am I to question Him?

One day when someone was talking of doing this and that, Bhagavan [Sri Ramana  
Maharshi] asked, "Why do you think that you are the doer? There lies all the  
trouble. It is quite absurd, as it is obvious to all that `I' does nothing. It  
is only the body that acts, **`I ' is always the witness. We so associate  
ourselves with our thoughts and actions that we continually say, `I did this  
or that,' when we did nothing at all. Concentrate on being the witness and let  
things take their course, they will go on anyhow, you cannot prevent them."**   
That 's the point! Things will go on anyhow, but Bhagavan taught that though  
we had no power to stop them, we did have the power to observe them from a  
detached point of view, as the witness and not as the doer. That was the  
purpose of life, and Sadhana consisted exactly in that.**

There is no process to become silent.   
To disturb your mind you need process,   
but to stay silent there is no process.   
Stay in satsang, stay quiet,   
always have love with your own Self.   
You are not to win it by any attempt or effort.   
Simply stay quiet.   
If any thought rises, simply find out where it came from.

Nagaraj/Friends,   
Excerpt from an article by Swami Chetanananda as to how the Gospel of Sri  
Ramakrishna came to be written.It may be noted that this had the encouragement  
and blessings of none other than The Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi, who M had  
always looked for guidance and advice: The Origin of The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna M. based his Sri Sri Ramakrishna  
Kathamrita (The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna) on his diary entries from 26th  
February 1882 to 10th May 1887. He began to develop his diaries for  
publication within a couple of years after the Master's passing away, but he  
did not make all of the entries public. On 11 July 1888 M. read a chapter of  
the Kathamrita to Holy Mother, who was then living in Nilambar Babu's garden  
house in Belur. After she heard this reading from the manuscript, she praised  
M. and encouraged him to write more. On 15 March 1890 M. read another chapter  
to Holy Mother and received her blessing and approval to publish it. In 1892 a  
small pamphlet of 20 pages was released under the title Paramahamsadever Ukti  
- Part 3 by Satchidananda Gitaratna,and collected by Sadhu Mahindranath  
Gupta.Swami Vivekananda read this pamphlet and wrote to M. from Antpur on 7th  
February 1889: "Thanks! 100,000 times, Master! You have hit Ramkristo in the  
right point. Few alas, few understand him!! My heart leaps in joy - and it is  
a wonder that I do not go mad when I find anybody thoroughly launched into the  
midst of the doctrine which is to show peace on earth hereafter".   
M. was busy with family duties, so he could not always concentrate on  
developing his diaries for publication. On 26th November 1895, Holy Mother  
wrote to M. from Kamarpukur: "Please preserve those teachings of the Master  
which he left with you". M. was inspired by her letter to publish Leaves from  
the Gospel of the Lord Sri Ramakrishna, which came out serially in the  
English-language magazine starting on 15 October 1897. Swami Vivekananda read  
the series and wrote to M. from Rawalpindi in October 1897: "Dear M., C'est  
bon mon ami - Now you are doing just the thing. Come out man. No sleeping all  
life. Time is flying. Bravo, that is the way. Many many thanks for your  
publication. Only I am afraid it will not pay its way in a pamphlet form...  
Never mind - pay or no pay. Let it see the blaze of daylight. You will have  
many blessings on you and many more curses but that is always the way of the  
world, sir. This is the time".   
Swami Vivekananda wrote to M. again on 24th November 1897, this time from  
Dehra Dun: "My dear M., Many many thanks for your second leaflet, it is indeed  
wonderful. The move is quite original and never was the life of a great  
teacher brought before the public untarnished by the writer's mind as you are  
doing. The language also is beyond all praise - so fresh so pointed and withal  
so plain and easy. I cannot express in adequate terms how I have enjoyed the  
leaflets. I am really in a transport when I read them. Strange, isn't it? Our  
teacher and Lord was so original and each one of us will have to be original  
or nothing. _I now understand why none of us attempted his life before. It has  
been reserved for you - this great work. He is with you evidently_.   
 P.S. Socratic dialogues are Plato all over. You are entirely hidden.  
Moreover, the dramatic part is infinitely beautiful. Everybody likes it, here  
and in the West".   
After M. began publishing the Master's teachings in English in a pamphlet  
form, a critic wrote in Tattwamanjari magazine: "We have a request to Mr.  
Gupta to publish these teachings in a big book form instead of in small  
pamphlets, that will benefit the masses. Again, we wonder, why did he publish  
it in English instead of Bengali? It is needless to remind him that sometimes  
the spirit of such deep spiritual truths diminishes while translating them  
into English. It would be difficult for our people to understand these  
teachings". _M. later acquiesced to the critic 's request. This criticism,  
however, was nothing compared to the appreciation that M. received from many  
distinguished reviewers. The English-language pamphlets created a tremendous  
stir because readers found Ramakrishna's teachings new and exciting. But M.  
eventually decided to publish The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna in Bengali, so  
that readers could taste the original beauty of the Master's mother tongue_.   
Again, he sought Holy Mother's blessing. On 4th July 1897 Holy Mother wrote to  
M. from Jayrambati: " _My dear child, whatever you heard from the Master was  
true. You should not feel any fear in publishing them. At one time he left  
those teachings in your custody, and now he is bringing them to light through  
you. Know for certain that people 's spiritual consciousness will not be  
awakened without bringing out those teachings. Whatever words of the Master  
you collected are true. One day while I was listening to your manuscript, I  
felt as if the Master was saying all those things_".   
continued.....

Friends,   
Since I have alluded to the inaccuracies in 'Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi'  
(The Original English version) and 'Sri Bhagavath Vachanamrutam'....thought of  
sharing how the two compare.   
Here is talk 248 (Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi)   
Talk 248.   
Quote  
> Sri Bhagavan said: **The Jnani says, 'I am the body'**; The ajnani says, "I  
> am the body"; what is the difference? 'I am' is the truth. The body is the  
> limitation. The ajnani limits the 'I' to the body. 'I' remains independent  
> of the body in sleep. The same 'I' is now in the wakeful state. Though  
> imagined to be within the body, 'I' is without the body. **The wrong notion  
> is not 'I am the body.'** 'I' says so. The body is insentient and cannot say  
> so. The mistake lies in thinking that 'I' is what ?I? is not. ?I? is not  
> insentient. 'I' cannot be the inert body. The body?s movements are  
> confounded with 'I' and misery is the result.Whether the body works or not,  
> 'I' remains free and happy. The ajnani?s 'I' is the body only. That is the  
> whole error. The jnani?s ?I? includes the body and everything else. Clearly  
> some intermediate entity arises and gives rise to the confusion  
.   
I happened to receive the above talk in a mail....and thought that the person  
who sent it had keyed in wrongly,especially the highlighted phrases in the  
above passage...for.... which jnani has upheld the 'I am the Body' view?....In  
fact that is the very root of the problem and the passage further goes on to  
say ' **The wrong notion is not 'I am the body.'**!!!   
I looked up the talk 248 and found that the friend has indeed copied it  
faithfully!...so,the mistake is there in the original published version only.   
I then referred to the tamizh translation of the original (Bhagavath  
Vachanamrutam by Sri Viswanatha Swami) and found it as follows: பகவான்:ஞானிக்கும் அஞ்ஞானிக்கும் உடல் நானேயாம்.ஆனால் அஞ்ஞானி   
'நான் இருக்கிறேன்' என்னும் உண்மையை உடலளவாய்க் குறுக்கிக் கொள்கிறான். அதாவது  
உடலே   
நானென்று. தூக்கத்தில் உடலை அபேஷியாமலேயே நான் என்பது சுதந்திரமாயிருக்கிறது. அதே   
'நான்' விழிப்பு நிலைமையில் இப்போதும் இருக்கிறது. 'நான்' என்பது உடலுள்ளே  
இருப்பது   
போலத்தோன்றினும் அது உடலற்றதேயாம்.உடல் ஜடமாதலின் அது 'உடல் நான்' என்று   
சொல்லாது. ஆத்மாவுக்கு ஏதோவொன்றைப் பற்றிய நான் என்னும் எழுச்சியில்லை. இடையில்   
ஏதோவொன்று கிளம்பி 'உடல் நான்' என்று சொல்கிறது. அது உடலின் இயக்கங்களைத் தனதாய்   
அபிமானித்து வருந்துகிறது. அவ்வகந்தையற்றுத் தூய அஹம்ஸ்புரணமாய் விளங்குபவனே  
ஞானி.   
அவனுக்கு உடலும் உள்ளதனைத்தும் நானேயாம். அவன் உடலுக்கு எது நேரினும், அத்துடன்   
சம்பந்தப்படாது என்றும் ஆனந்தமயனாகவே இருப்பான்.   
The Tamizh version is clear and true to what Sri Bhagavan has always  
maintained.   
" **ஞ ானிக்கும் அஞ்ஞானிக்கும் உடல் நானேயாம்**"....this can be translated as  
follows:"For both the jnani and the ajnani,the body is verily I"(This is not  
the same as is found in the original- **The Jnani says, 'I am the body'**; The  
ajnani says, "I am the body"....for the jnani will never say 'I am the  
body'!).   
There are some instances like this where the original English version is  
muddled....although there are such inaccuracies(grave ones!)... this should  
not be taken as a criticism of the entire work or detract from its  
usefulness.   
Namaskar

This appears in ulladu naarpadu: உடனானே தன்னை யுணரார்க் குணர்ந்தார்க்   
குடலளவே நான்ற னுணரார்க் குடலுள்ளே   
தன்னுணர்ந்தார்க் கெல்லையறத் தானொளிரு நானிதுவே   
யின்னவர்தம் பேதமென வெண்ணுவாய் முன்னாம்   
பொருள்: மாமிசப் பொதியாகிய உடம்பு தன்னை உணராத அஞ்ஞானிக்கும், தன்னை உணர்ந்த ஞானிக்கும்  
நானாகும். அஞ்ஞானிக்கு நான் என்னும் சொல்லின் உணர்வு உடலின் அளவேயாகும். உடலுள்ளே  
தன்னை உணர்ந்த ஞானிக்கு நான் என்னும் ஆன்மா எல்லையற்று (உடம்பையும்  
தன்னுள்கொண்டு) எங்கும் தன்மயமாய்ப் பிரகாசிக்கும். இருவருக்கும் உள்ள வேறுபாடு  
இதுவே என்று அறிவாயாக.   
In verse 17 he says that both for those who have not known self and for those  
who have known it, the body is certainly ?I?, but that the difference between  
them is that to those who have not known self, ?I? is limited to the measure  
of the body, whereas to those who have known self, ?I? shines without any  
limit (and hence neither the body nor anything else exists as other than it).

Nagaraj,   
Yes....The friend came up with this reference from uLLadhu nArpadhu.   
The Translation should have the comma after 'udal uLLe'......i.e 'குடலளவே  
நான்ற னுணரார்க் குடலுள்ளே' is to be taken as a complete sentence(or  
phrase)....meaning that to those who know not the Self,the 'I' is limited to  
the body and is within the body(perceived as such)....whereas to those who  
have known the Self the 'I' is limitless and shines of its own accord(self  
luminous).... **Deem this** as the difference between them.   
To those who know the Self, even the world is within the 'I'(Like Mother  
Yashoda seeing the universe within the mouth of Child Sri Krishna!). ....what  
to speak of the limited body!It is for those who do not perceive the Self that  
the 'I' is perceived as something within the body and limited to it....for  
them,beyond the 'Body' it is the 'Not I' or the 'other'(anya)   
(Sri Bhagavan never admits any actual difference.for the very difference  
between those who know and know not is not admissible to him!yet for the  
purpose of our understanding,he says 'Deem this' to be the difference)   
Namaskar

SAMITHADHAANAM**   
September 4, 2016   
​?SAMITHADHANAM? ? Not to be missed   
https://srinivassharmablog.wordpress.com/2016/09/04/samithadhaanam/   
SAMITHADHANAM   
What is Samithadhanam?   
it is a ritual to be performed by a Brahmi boy after Sacred Thread Function,   
usually after Sandhyavandhanam ! ?SAMITHADHANAM? is a ?SUN WORSHIP? ! This is  
continued till his marriage.   
It is a kind of worship, offering prayer to the FIRE GOD or SURYA i.e Sun.  
This prayer offer in itself is an environmental cleansing act.   
How is it performed ?   
1\. Usually, a four-sided elevated platform is created (Bricks model or  
nowadays, even Cement Model is available) ?. Camphor is placed in the centre  
and is lit.   
2\. While chanting the mantras, the sticks (from branches) of Peepal Tree  
(Arasa-Maram or Ashvatha-Tree) is placed on the fire accordingly.   
3\. Sticks will get burnt and the residue (Ashes) of the pooja is kept on the  
forehead, shoulders, throat ?.   
4\. This is regarded as a purification process, not only for the person who  
is performing it, but also for the environment !!   
Why is Peepal tree?s branch sticks been used ?   
Peepal tree has its significance not only mythologically but also  
scientifically !   
Traditionally, people are of the belief that even Goddess Lakshmi dwell in  
the tree on Saturdays. Women who are not blessed with a child tie a red  
thread around the trunk or o its branches asking the deities to bless her and  
fulfill her desire.   
Scientifically, this tree has the power to purify the human body system ?  
especially NERVOUS System. Peepal tree is of great medicinal value. Its  
leaves serve as a wonderful laxative as well as tonic for the body and as a  
cure for about 50 types of disorders including Asthma, diabetes, Diarrhea,   
Epilepsy, Gastric problems, inflammatory disorders. It is especially useful  
for patients suffering from Jaundice. The leaves of Peepal are highly  
effective in treating heart disorders. It helps to control the palpitation of  
heart and combat the cardiac weakness. Ayurveda makes an extensive use of the  
leaves of peepal due to the numerous benefits it provides.   
Does this smoke while performing Samithadhanam cause pollution ?   
This is the most awkward question asked by many of my friends in my batch  
while a HOMAM was conducted in my school. At that point of time, even though  
being a regular performer of SAMITHADHANAM, I couldnt give them the best  
answer due to lack of scientific reasoning.   
The appropriate justification is that the smoke caused here is not something  
like the smoke caused through CARS BUSES etc? (where harmful chemicals like  
BUTENINE is released), thus has its own ill effects !   
The smoke when the branch sticks of Peepal are burnt during SAMITHADHANAM  
performance is a kind of BIO-Fuel when burnt, and the release of smoke from  
it is said to be of a medicinal purification process (specifically for  
Nervous Systems), and might just create a minute CO (Carbon-monoxide) which  
is a gas that is required to maintain a balance in the atmosphere !   
Furthermore, what I personally feel is the power of the positive vibrations of  
the mantras which is chanted alongside during SAMITHADHANAM ! It has its own  
GODLINESS in it and the same can be realisesd wonly when performed.   
A little upset about the fact that not many are practicing this and I have to  
come to a mindset that it is purely their loss ( which is a loss to the  
welfare of all the people too) ?. Nothing can be done! Hope practices are kept  
alive with the scope of extra-ordinary communication transfer facilities, so  
these are not left uncared for !   
Parents can also enable their sons to perform this by motivating their sons  
like how my mother made it possible for me !!!   
I have to cite this incident : you all might be aware of the BHOPAL GAS  
TRAGEDY which took away the lives of many, but the chemical harmful gas  
didn?t have any effect on the people and their houses in which SAMITHADHANAM  
and HOMAMS where regularly performed !   
It is clearly evident from all this that our traditions and cultural practices  
has its own divinity and supreme significance ? not just that, but also has  
scientific reasons and justifications behind it too!   
PROUD TO BE AN INDIAN !!!   
P.S :- What motivated me to do a research and find out the real reasons of my  
regular practice was just because of the people who knew nothing about its  
sginificance and had words to say that SAMITHADHANAM causes POLLUTION !

In any Sadhana, concentration is the essence of success.   
If it is Puja, cocentrate on the Puja, on the idol to whom   
you do Puja, concentrate on every flower that you offer,   
concentrate on the mantra you chant. Live in total concentration,   
till you offer Arti, place it on your eyes   
and complete the Puja.   
If it is mantra japa, do not count the mantras. If you   
do so, your mind will go only into the counting mathematics.   
Do it without counting, as far as practicable.   
If it is meditation, instead of mediating on Pure Space,   
try to meditate on a symbol, say Bhagavan Ramana's face   
or feet. Chant mantra within your lips and if any thought   
drags you out, you mentally imagine, that you are placing   
a flower on His feet and come back to the meditating mode.   
Arunachala Siva.

The Greatness of "Rama" Jap**a   
A devotee asked,   
?Swami, what is the easiest way to attain moksha??   
Bhagavan Sri Ramana said with a smile,   
?As and when the mind goes astray,   
it should be turned inward and made to steady   
itself in the thought of the Self.   
That is the only way.?   
Another devotee said,   
?To do so, the repeating of the name of Rama is good, is it not??   
?Certainly, it is good,? said Bhagavan Sri Ramana.   
?What could be better?   
The greatness of the japa   
of the name of Rama is extraordinary.   
In the story of Namadeva he is reported to   
have told one devotee,   
?If you want to know the greatness of the name of Rama   
you must first know what your own name is,   
what your real nature (swarupa) is,   
who you are and how you were born.   
Unless you know your own origin,   
you will not know your name!?   
This idea is found in the Abhangas   
of Namadeva written in Marathi language and   
in the Malayalam Adhyatma Ramayana.?   
Thereupon Bhagavan Sri Ramana related a story from the latter.   
IT IS STATED in that book that   
when Anjaneya ( Lord Hanuman) went in search of Sita,   
he seated himself opposite to Ravana in the Darbar Hall   
on a high pedestal and fearlessly spoke to him thus: ?Oh Ravana,   
I give you a teaching (upadesa) for attaining liberation (moksha).   
Please listen to me carefully.   
It is certain that the Self (Atma) gets purified   
by intense devotion to Hari,   
who is in the lotus of the Heart at all times.   
The ego gets destroyed and   
then the sin gets destroyed.   
Afterwards, in its place,   
the knowledge of the transcendent Self emerges.   
With a pure mind and with the Bliss (Ananda)   
generated by a firm knowledge of the Self,   
the two letters ?Ra? ?Ma?   
which are like mantras,   
will repeat themselves within you automatically.   
What more is required for a person   
who has this knowledge,   
however little it might be ?   
Hence worship the lotus feet of Vishnu,   
which will remove all worldly fears,   
which are dear to all devotees and   
which shine as brightly as the light of a crore of Suns.   
Give up the ignorance of your mind?.   
This has been mentioned in two or three slokas in the Sanskrit Adhyatma  
Ramayanam but not as elaborately as   
in the Malayalam text.   
Is the greatness of the name of Rama ordinary?   
~ from Spiritual Stories as told by Ramana Maharshi book   
Q : I was in Anandashram doing Ram nam, but to no avail.   
What was I doing wrong?   
Sri Papaji : You can chant this name Ram,   
but nobody knows how to chant it.   
It will work to some extent if you don't know how just because it will keep  
your mind off distractions.   
But if you know how it will be much more powerful than this.   
The first thing to remember is this: Chant the name on the breath, not with the tongue.   
Let the breath chant the name, not the tongue.   
Don't put a pressure on anything.   
Just let the breathing in and out happen   
without your notice, naturally and habitually.   
Then this will continue while working, walking, shopping and sleeping.   
I have seen people who have chanted this name for crores of time with no  
effort.   
Do it this way and within days   
you will see the one whose name is chanted.   
In the Kali yuga there is no time for penance,   
but the power of the word is tremendous.   
Ram purifies.   
The word "Ram" will enter your heart.   
It is a raft to cross the ocean.   
Let it be the last word of the last breath.   
Ram will confer Freedom without practice.   
Beyond everything there is nothing to do and   
no appearance of anything there is only the Self   
which is neither subject nor object.   
This is the highest experience because there is no experiencer, just Peace.  
Then you know that: I am That seated in the center of the Heart,   
and this is Om Mani Padme Hum.

Today 2 Oct is Gandhi Jayanthi Day and When Gandhiji is mentioned "RAM NAM"  
also follows and he always used to keep repeating RAM NAM. There are now some  
people who dispute the fact that Gandhiji uttered the name of RAM during his  
death and say that it was all a story spread by the Congress. Those fools do  
not understand the fact that Japa need not be verbal and has various layers  
from Gross to subtle and finally for a highly evolved soul the Japa goes on  
spontaneously. Gandhiji was a highly evolved soul and the Japa of RAM NAM was  
going inside him spontaneously and how does one know of that. Only another  
highly evolved soul can know and that other soul was Papaji ( a great disciple  
of Ramana Maharshi ) who described this experience of Gandhi in his own words  
**" He [Gandhi] was a great saint. I could see that just by looking at his  
body. I didn?t need to look into his eyes. He had the most sattvic body I have  
ever seen. It was copper-coloured and on a subtle level it was glowing with  
the light of Brahman.   
He had a beautiful body. The only body that I have seen that was as beautiful  
as his was the Maharshi?s. Both of their bodies used to shine.   
I was once sitting with Gandhi when I heard the sound of ?Ram Ram? coming from  
him. His lips were not moving so I looked to see where the sound was coming  
from. As I focused on the source of the sound, I realised that it was  
emanating from his body. The sound was coming out of the pores of his skin. He  
didn?t need to repeat the name anymore. It was going on continuously inside  
him and flowing outwards through his skin. "** ( Taken from the book "Nothing  
Ever Happened " by Davdi Godman ). So at least from now on let us not spread  
nonsense about Great Souls without understanding the depth from which they  
were operating and do not pass judgements based on how they behaved at the  
bodily level.

Sri Arunachaleswara Temple: Maha Kumbhabishekam: Renovation is underway at Sri Arunachaleswarar Temple where the thousand  
pillar hall, temple   
gopurams, stonework, deities, paintings and ceremonial utensils are being  
renovated and will   
culminate in Mahakumbhabhiskeam (reconstruction ceremony). The re-dedication  
is scheduled   
for February 2017, though exact dates have not been determined. The last  
Mahakumbhabhiksham   
at the Big Temple took place in June 2012, when hundreds of Sivacharyas and  
purohits performed   
Homas at dozens of Agni Kundams in the Yagosala. Prior to 2002,  
Kumbhabhisheams of Arunachaleswara   
Temple took place in 1976, 1944 and 1918.

Whether you meditate on God or   
on the Self is immaterial....   
the goal is the same....   
All kinds of thoughts arise in meditation....   
They rise up spontaneously in order to be extinguished in due course....   
Thoughts are vasanas accumulated in innumerable [previous] births.....   
Their annihilation is the aim.....   
Atman, the Self,   
is realized with 'mruta manas', i.e. mind devoid of thoughts and turned  
inward.....   
Then the mind sees its own source and becomes   
That.....

The Greatness of "Rama" Jap**a   
A devotee asked,   
?Swami, what is the easiest way to attain moksha??   
Bhagavan Sri Ramana said with a smile,   
?As and when the mind goes astray,   
it should be turned inward and made to steady   
itself in the thought of the Self.   
That is the only way.?   
Another devotee said,   
?To do so, the repeating of the name of Rama is good, is it not??   
?Certainly, it is good,? said Bhagavan Sri Ramana.   
?What could be better?   
The greatness of the japa   
of the name of Rama is extraordinary.   
In the story of Namadeva he is reported to   
have told one devotee,   
?If you want to know the greatness of the name of Rama   
you must first know what your own name is,   
what your real nature (swarupa) is,   
who you are and how you were born.   
Unless you know your own origin,   
you will not know your name!?   
This idea is found in the Abhangas

but in the endless sky-way of your name?   
( a poem in Mountain Path, October -December 2016.)   
Arunachala Siva.

Sri Arunachaleswara Temple: Maha Kumbhabishekam: Renovation is underway at Sri Arunachaleswarar Temple where the thousand  
pillar hall, temple   
gopurams, stonework, deities, paintings and ceremonial utensils are being  
renovated and will   
culminate in Mahakumbhabhiskeam (reconstruction ceremony). The re-dedication  
is scheduled   
for February 2017, though exact dates have not been determined. The last  
Mahakumbhabhiksham   
at the Big Temple took place in June 2012, when hundreds of Sivacharyas and  
purohits performed   
Homas at dozens of Agni Kundams in the Yagosala. Prior to 2002,  
Kumbhabhisheams of Arunachaleswara   
Temple took place in 1976, 1944 and 1918.   
(Mountain Path, October - December 2016.)   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniam Sir   
I was aware of Sri Ramalinga Swamigal's Birthday on 5 Oct 2016 but as I am  
busy with the Navarathri Prayers and visits could not write on Saint Ramalinga  
Swamigal and will do my best to write in the coming days.

Whether you meditate on God or   
on the Self is immaterial....   
the goal is the same....   
All kinds of thoughts arise in meditation....   
They rise up spontaneously in order to be extinguished in due course....   
Thoughts are vasanas accumulated in innumerable [previous] births.....   
Their annihilation is the aim.....   
Atman, the Self,   
is realized with 'mruta manas', i.e. mind devoid of thoughts and turned  
inward.....   
Then the mind sees its own source and becomes   
That.....

**ANNAMALAI SWAMI ? FINAL TALKS**   
Question: It is difficult for me to stay focused on the   
?I?-thought, especially when I am in the middle of worldly activities. Is it  
enough to be aware of awareness, of consciousness in general?   
Annamalai Swami: If you are conscious of consciousness, there is no duality.  
Everything is included in consciousness.   
Question: But is it enough to be aware of the awareness?   
Annamalai Swami: You are repeating the question, so I will repeat the answer.  
If you remain in the state of consciousness,   
there will be nothing apart from it. No problems, no misery, no   
questions.   
Question: Are you always in that state of consciousness? I find that when I am  
busy with activities, thoughts come up and I am no longer remembering myself.  
I am no longer focusing on   
consciousness.   
Annamalai Swami: I don't lose consciousness of the Self   
because I don't get identified with the body and the mind. It is only in the  
state in which you identify with the body and the mind that problems arise.   
In deep sleep we forget the body and the mind, but consciousness is still  
there. That same state is present now, while we are awake. If you give up all  
your ideas about separateness, that will be enough. When those ideas have gone  
you realize you are everything.

**I saw this post on FB posted by a devotee of Bhagavan Ramana and Kanchi  
Acharya but this incident was pointed out by Sri Nochur in his talk on Japa  
Yoga.   
 **Why Meditate**   
*A devotee asked Ramana Maharishi:*   
"Why do we need to meditate?   
I can say that it is "my mind" \- then should it not listen to me and meditate  
by itself when I tell it to?   
Why does it keep running outside all the time?"   
*Ramana Maharishi kept silent at that time.*   
At about the same time, a squirrel had given birth in the ashram, and  
unfortunately a few days later the mother squirrel got eaten by a cat.   
Ramana Maharishi took the job of taking care of the baby squirrels. He kept  
them inside a cage that was kept in the mediation hall.   
After a few days when everyone was sitting in the meditation hall, the same  
cat came inside. It so happened that the baby squirrels rushed out of the cage  
at the same time.   
Ramana Maharishi got up hurriedly, caught all the baby squirrels one by one  
and put them back in the cage, shut and locked the door firmly.   
He then turned to the devotee who had asked the above question and calmly said  
- *"These poor little squirrels do not have the maturity to know the dangers  
of the outside world, that if it goes out, the cat will make a meal of them.   
When they get that maturity, they will go hide inside, by themselves.   
Until they get the maturity, we have to keep putting them inside.   
It is the same thing with our mind. **Our mind does not know that if it goes  
to the outside world, there is nothing but Suffering and Confusion. It keeps  
running out in ignorance and start Wandering aimlessly with no purpose &  
meaning.   
When it gets the maturity, it will go inside by itself to seek Peace, to gain  
strength to Focus on Life to make it more purposeful and give Life more  
meaning.   
Until then, it is our job to put it inside with effort - which we do in  
Meditation."**

Does anyone know if Annamalai Swami realized the Self? I haven't read his  
book by David Godman, but I've seen an interview of his and have heard stories  
about him. I didn't consider that he could've been a jnani until I saw  
somebody saying so on a website...

Dear Orihh,   
Please do not worry about whether AS realized Atman or not. Please do your  
duty.   
Please do Atma Vicharam carefully and attain the Self and that is enough.   
People in the Asramam says that AS had attained the Brahman. And that is all.

**CONVERSATIONS WITH ANNAMALAI SWAMI**   
Saint Tayumanuvar once said, 'Why all these maha yogas [great yogas]? All  
these yogas are maya!'   
If you try to meditate without understanding that your real nature is Self,  
and Self alone, your meditation practice will only   
lead you to more mental bondage.   
Bhagavan once said. To keep the mind in the Self all you have to do is remain  
still'.   
To realize the Self you don't actually have to do anything except be still.  
Just give up identifying with the mind and hold onto the Self. That is enough.  
Be still and cultivate the awareness of ?I am the Self; the Self is all'. What  
difficulties can arise from doing a simple practice like this?   
Q: The mind doesn't want to be ignored. It wants to spin round and round  
forever. I came to you because I thought that you might be able to help me to  
gain some control over my wayward thoughts.   
AS: 'Who came here for help?' Find out who that person is. Don't automatically  
assume that he exists and that he needs help with his problems. If you think  
like this your problems will increase, not decrease.   
Identifying oneself with the body and the mind results in   
ignorance of the Self. This is how the ego takes birth. Detaching ourselves  
and disengaging from the body and the mind results in the death of the ego.  
Bhagayan once said to me: The one who limits the Self by believing himself to  
be the body and the mind has ?killed? his own Self.   
For killing the Self he has to be punished. The punishment is birth and death  
and continuous misery.'

**205-Questions asked and Ma (Anadmayi Ma ) answers.....**   
(Continued from post 204)   
 **Q-Those who cure the sting of a scorpion repeat their mantra only once a  
year for three hours while others cannot do anything effective in spite of  
performing japa of the name of Rama throughout the year. What is the reason  
for this?**   
Ma-Here something has to be made clear. Mahatmas say, do not even give a  
thought to the result of your devotions. To engage in japa of the name of Rama  
and at the same time to look for the benefit to be derived from it is not  
right. It just cannot be that Rama will not remove your sorrow. The person who  
is able to cure scorpion bite cannot cure anything else, as for instance snake  
bite. There are different mantras for snake bite. All these mantras and  
tantras are contained within God. Shiva and Vishnu have to be invoked by  
separate mantras. The mantras originating from Rishis have definite power.  
Just as when I exclaim "father", you will reply, "yes!" When called in anger  
you would respond in a different manner. By mantra japa the threefold  
suffering of the world is appeased. Just as snake poison is counteracted by  
certain special mantras, so it is possible to bring to a standstill the  
torturous course of this poisonous world by the power of God's holy name. If  
you utter the name of Rama with your last breath you will conquer death  
itself. Keep on repeating "Rama, Rama" and do not even look for the results to  
be obtained. Actually, if you hanker after results it must be understood that  
you are not seeking immortality. As you sow, so exactly will you reap. The  
results of your evil ways are most certainly accumulating in the measure as  
you practice them. When there is a desire for the fruit of action, you are  
bound to reap it. Who is God? From where do you derive the capacity to utter  
"I"? God is the mechanic who runs the machine, it is He who is making everyone  
move. Keep on repeating "Rama, Rama." The more you do so the keener will your  
inner eagerness grow. The sadhaka thinks he is dying. "Rama" means arama, rest  
and peace. Atmarama, the Rama in your soul, will not let you die, on the  
contrary your eagerness to realise God will increase even more. Thereby your  
impure desires will be blotted out and the name of Rama will never again  
forsake you. Oh Rama, how comforting it is to utter Thy name!   
Jai Ma.

I have a few questions if anyone is willing to say anything about them: What is the difference between chanting mantra aloud and repeating mantra in  
the mind? What purpose does either serve, and why?   
When practicing japa, is it okay if the meaning of each word that is repeated  
is thought about and then pictured/imagined? For an example, if one takes up  
the mantra "Om Namah Shivaya", should the devotee say or think "Om", then  
think of Brahman, then say or think "Namah", imagine prostrating, then say or  
think "Shivaya", and think of and picture Shiva?   
If the "I"-thought sinks into the heart through Self-Enquiry because it has no  
thoughts to cling on to, how then will the "I"-thought sink into the heart if  
it is clinging to japa?

Dear Orihh,   
It is said that when the mantra chanted aloud it has the power to affect the  
body first and Your surroundings also. When it is done for few months or  
so,Its vibration and the energy it brings takes over the body,and we can feel  
it. It calms,soothes... That is why some teachers say that it is better to  
chant the mantra loudly first,and when You can feel Its effect clearly,to  
start to chant it silently.   
Then,all the power of the mantra is on the mind. Sure,it is advisable to be  
alone when You chant it,especially when You are chanting it aloud.   
You use it until it does its purpose. Usually,we become aware when the mantra  
is no longer needed. Then,the next stage is dyana,and then dropping of all of  
this. So,this is the answer on Your last question :"If the "I"-thought sinks  
into the heart through Self-Enquiry because it has no thoughts to cling on to,  
how then will the "I"-thought sink into the heart if it is clinging to japa?".  
The mind simply does not cling onto japa anymore in that stage. It drops  
everything,the mind is pure enough,so to say,and this 'I' can sink into the  
Heart. The japa should not become the hindrance. Well,somehow i think when the  
love is there,its all unfolds how it should. When the love and dedication are  
there,japa takes over,and it goes by itself. Our whole body starts vibrating  
with it,and it is not the part of our effort anymore,so there is no question  
of dropping also.   
In a way,the japa cleans the mind,and brings awareness of our chosen God,and  
eventually,it brings awareness on our very Self in the end,since the God our  
Self are one and the same. Which is sure the main purpose. But i feel it is  
not correct to say this only,because the Japa is much more than this. It is  
Faith,it is Trust,it is the God Himself. That is why it is very important to  
have the faith in the japa,to have love and devotion towards Your chosen image  
of God.   
I think it is best to repeat it with love and thinking about that what You are  
saying,like You do. But do it how it comes to You,how You feel it and see it.  
Love and Trust are very important. Then there is no struggling. They also say  
it is not advisable if You find it very difficult,and if it is just dull  
repeating. Japa has the power in itself,and brings the merit anyway,since it  
is Sacred word,but the best way to do it is to be completely aware on its  
meaning.   
What i can tell You from my own experience,and i am not some expert in this  
field,is,when You come to the stage when the death seems to be on the  
corner,when all seems to be dark and lost,and everything loses its  
purpose,when the fear overtakes You,do not run away from it. Drop it only when  
becomes impossible.   
Or,when the times comes to drop it,and You do it,do not come back to it  
because of fear. This is what i saw and where i made mistakes. Also,it is very  
very advisable to remain silent while You are doing this practice,and not to  
entertain many thoughts on the happenings and the people around You,especially  
negative. Divert Your awareness on the japa.   
Anyway,do not think too much in future,and about all this i said about  
dropping and all. Just go step by step,do Your practice of japa,have faith in  
what you are doing,and all will happen as it should.   
All i said this is a part of all what i have read on this subject,and some is  
from my own experience. I truly do not know if its is like this for  
everyone,or is it same for all. I have noticed it is not,but,really,cannot  
tell.   
 _ **' Ishvara is the Atman as seen or grasped by the mind. His highest name  
is Om; so repeat it, meditate on it, and think of all its wonderful nature and  
attributes. Repeating the Om continually is the only true worship. It is not a  
word, it is God Himself.'-Swami Vivekananda**_   
_Q: The repetition of the name of God is very common in India. Is there  
any virtue in it?   
M: When you know the name of a thing, or a person, you can find it easily. By  
calling God by His name you make Him come to you.   
Q: In what shape does He come?   
M: According to your expectations. If you happen to be unlucky and some  
saintly soul gives you a mantra for good luck and you repeat it with faith and  
devotion, your bad luck is bound to turn. Steady faith is stronger than  
destiny. Destiny is the result of causes, mostly accidental, and is therefore  
loosely woven. Confidence and good hope will overcome it easily.   
Q: When a mantra is chanted, what exactly happens?   
M: The sound of mantra creates the shape which will embody the Self. The Self  
can embody any shape -- and operate through it. After all, the Self is  
expressing itself in action -- and a mantra is primarily energy in action. It  
acts on you, it acts on your surroundings.   
Q: The mantra is traditional. Must it be so?   
M: Since time immemorial a link was created between certain words and  
corresponding energies and reinforced by numberless repetitions. It is just  
like a road to walk on. It is an easy way -- only faith is needed. You trust  
the road to take you to your destination._**   
_Constant repetition of words (Japa) is a kind of madness but deliberate  
madness. All repetitiveness is tamas, but repeating the name of God is a  
satwa-tamas due its higher purpose. Because of the satwa the tamas will wear  
out and will take the shape of detachment, relinquishment, aloofness,  
immutability. The purpose of Japa is to conserve oneself, that means the  
knowingness (the knowledge ?I am?) is to be returned. Japa in Marathi means to  
guard, to protect. You should protect your beingness by Japa.

Thank you so much, Jewell, for such an in-depth response! There are plenty of  
things I can take away from this.   
On the path of bhakti or surrenderance, love towards the Guru, God, the Self,  
and everything and everyone else is the essence of practice, correct? This  
will take you all the way. What I don't understand completely is the idea of  
faith and hope - this is a bit ambiguous to me. Faith means believing in the  
power of the Guru, God, or the Self, but does it also mean believing that one  
will succeed? Is this also the meaning of hope? That one will eventually  
reach para-bhakti after arduous devotion? If so, at what point does such a  
faith become counter-productive? I always read that having expectations to  
achieve any sort of success is completely incorrect practice.

Dear Orihh,   
Quote  
> Faith means believing in the power of the Guru, God, or the Self, but does  
> it also mean believing that one will succeed?  
Faith is exactly believing that one will succeed! We must have faith in  
ourselves.   
Later,that faith is not that we will succeed,it is that we already are That  
what our Guru said we are.   
Regarding hope,i consider it little bit different. Hope is indeed a sort of  
expectation. But the faith is some deep assurance and knowledge. -that we will  
succeed,that God and our Guru is guiding us,and in the end,that we are That  
what He says we are.   
Somehow it is a wordless assurance,in spite of all fear and confusion,felt  
deeply in our heart...   
I believe that faith cannot in any way be counter-productive. Only hope  
can,because it is a sort of expectation. True faith is much more than that.   
But there is nothing wrong to have hope. We all have it,and we all expect  
something. It is what is driving us towards our goal. Sometimes it is not even  
obvious to us. Actually,it is not obvious most of the time. It is the mind  
that is goal oriented,but it is natural in some stages of progress. Only later  
it can be seen for what it really is.   
Love,if genuine,will take care of this all.

**TEACHINGS OF SWAMI BRAHMANANDA, SPIRITUAL SON OF SRI RAMAKRISHNA**   
 **Maharaj, in spite of all my efforts, my mind is still restless. How can I  
curb it?**   
?Practice japa and meditation regularly. Do not miss even one day. The mind is  
like a spoiled child -always restless.   
Try repeatedly to steady it by fixing it on the Chosen Ideal, and at last you  
will become absorbed in Him.   
If you continue your practice for two or three years, you will begin to feel  
an unspeakable joy and the mind will become steady. In the beginning the  
practice of japa and meditation seems dry. It is like taking bitter medicine.   
You must forcibly pour the thought of God into your mind,   
then as you persist, you will be flooded with joy.   
What a tremendous ordeal a student goes through in order to pass his  
examination. To realize God is a far easier task! Call on him sincerely with a  
tranquil heart?

No matter what happens to your body, meditate. The body is a treacherous  
friend. Give it its due; no more. Never go to sleep at night until you have  
communed with God. Your body will remind you that you have worked hard and  
need rest, but the more you ignore its demands and concentrate on the Lord,  
the more you will be filled with joyous life. Then you will know that you are  
not the body. MEDITATE UNCEASINGLY that you quickly behold yourself as the  
Infinite Essence, free from every form of misery. Cease being a prisoner of  
the body, using the secret of Meditation and learn to escape into the Spirit.

A level of mental maturity is reached when nothing external is of any value  
and the heart is ready to relinquish all. Then the real has a chance and it  
grasps it. Delays, if any, are caused by the mind being unwilling to see or to  
discard.

In fact there may not be found any single individual in the world possessing  
all the qualities in perfection necessary for a mumukshu [mature soul] as  
mentioned in the Yoga Sutras etc.   
Still pursuit of Atmajnana should not be abandoned. Everyone is the Self by  
aparoksha [immediate or direct knowledge], although he is not aware, but  
identifies the Self with the body and feels miserable.

Whenever you get that thought of difficulty, dispose of it altogether by  
trying to find out whence it arises.   
Q. Can I realize the Self? It looks so difficult.   
A. You are already the Self. Therefore realization is for everyone.  
Realization knows no difference in the aspirants. This very doubt if I can  
realize or the feeling I have not realized, are the obstacles. Be free from  
these also.   
Q. Nevertheless unless I have the experience, how can I be free from these  
conflicting thoughts?   
A. These are also in the mind. They are there because you have identified  
yourself with the body. If this false identity drops away, ignorance will  
vanish and truth be revealed.

To find God you must know how to love, not God, but the human beings around  
you, the trees, the flowers, the birds. Then, when you know how to love them,  
you will really know what it is to love God. Without loving another, without  
knowing what it means to be completely in communion with one another, you  
cannot be in communion with truth. **~ Jiddu Krishnamurti**

**Sadhu Natanananda?s Ferocious Lecture About Self-Enquiry   
His face was red with rage. ?What a fool you are!? he told me. ?What do you  
think you have come to Bhagavan for??   
The day he understood his Self Realization, Sadhu Natanananda went incognito.  
The outward symbol of his becoming Self-realized was his obscurity. He lived  
alone ? happy to be immersed in the Self all the time.   
After Bhagavan?s mahasamadhi in 1950 and until 1967, many did not even know if  
Natanananda was still alive. Though he stayed in a cottage in Tiruvannamalai,  
no one knew where he was. Like most of the old devotees, I too thought that he  
had passed away.   
I had spent seven years in the ashram when suddenly one day my friend Dorab  
Framji asked me, ?Do you know Sadhu Natanananda is alive?? I jumped with joy  
because I loved his book, Spiritual Instruction, also known as Sri Ramana  
Darsanam. I paid him a visit. He was an austere man with nothing in his room  
except for a few loincloths. He blessed me and asked, ?What are you doing? Are  
you practicing Self-Enquiry??   
I replied, ?I am not capable of doing Self-Enquiry. I only chant Arunachala  
Siva, Arunachala Siva.?   
His face was red with rage. I was taken aback because this was my very first  
meeting with him and I was accustomed to people indulging me whenever they met  
me.   
Not Natanananda! He was a stern and serious man. He raged, ?What a fool you  
are! What do you think you have come to Bhagavan for? For what function has he  
chosen you? It is only to make you like him! Read his Forty Verses on Reality,  
practice Self-Enquiry, BE the truth. That is why you have been chosen!?   
I was stunned in disbelief.

**ANNAMALAI SWAMI ? FINAL TALKS**   
Thoughts will come as long as the potential for them is inside you. Good  
thoughts, bad thoughts, they will all keep coming.   
There is nothing you can do about this flow, but at the same time, this flow  
of thoughts need not be a problem.   
Be the Self, be the peace that is your real nature, and it will not matter  
what comes up. Walk, eat, drink, sleep, meditate, but never think that you are  
the one who is doing these things. The thought that you are doing something is  
the thought that is poisoning your life.   
Because once you think that you are doing something, you will start to think  
that you need to be doing something else to put yourself in a better  
situation. **You don 't have to do anything to experience the nectar of the  
Self. All you need to do is drop the idea that you are doing anything at  
all.**

**ANNAMALAI SWAMI ? FINAL TALKS**   
During sleep, you have no likes and dislikes. Jnanis and babies manage this  
while they are awake. Baby mind is good; jnani mind is good; 'I am the body'  
mind is very, very bad.   
Question: It's a poisonous thought!   
Annamalai Swami: Yes, yes. The 'I am the body' thought is just as poisonous as  
a cobra. 'All is my Self.' 'All is the nectar of my own Self.' These are the  
great affirmations that counter the 'I am the body' thought.   
Holding on to one of these sayings is the equal of millions of punyas. If we  
continuously meditate on the truth of these statements, if we hold on to the  
truth that they are pointing   
towards, countless punyas will accrue to us.   
There are many other mantras, but none are as useful as these. Rihhu Gitu  
says, 'All is one. All is the Self.' This is the truth that you have to hold  
onto. To the real ?I? nothing is foreign in the entire universe. If you know  
you are everything, there will be no desire to pursue some things and not  
others. Do you like or desire your arm more than your foot? When your body is  
the whole universe, likes, dislikes and desires will be absent.

Maharshi discouraged repeating such sentences. Annamalai Swami encouraged  
doing so. How to reconcile the difference?   
Each will go in the direction they gravitate.   
And, I am sure you aware,   
I believe Annamalai encouraged such repetition only if you were unable to  
undertake Vichara.   
But for the person who favours Vichara, **such repetition goes against the  
grain, as they are acutely aware that thoughts are a mirage.**

**Meditation**   
If we do not resolve to attack the deadly enemy in every nook and corner of  
our daily life, we shall never get rid of this ghost which we have pampered  
unconsciously for so long. But what is the means?   
There is only one way to overcome the ghost. ... to watch it.   
Do not fight, do not resist. Only try to watch it, quietly but ceaselessly.   
In other words, develop an unconcerned witness-consciousness towards men,  
things and happenings without, but particularly towards yourself within. It  
means to carry on the calmness of the mind gained in your meditation to cover  
your whole day. You will distinctly feel it as an undercurrent of peace and  
detachment.

**HEAVEN IS A WASTE OF TIME**   
Visitor: It is said in the scriptures that by doing virtuous deeds people are  
assured of heavenly enjoyments after death.   
Bhagavan: Maybe. But are you sure that what all you do are virtuous actions  
only? Even then after heavenly life, you have to experience the fruits of  
actions which had not yet fructified. One would have to roll again and again,  
endlessly, in the cycle of birth.   
V: That is why I sought Bhagavan's clarification.   
Bh: Our aim should be the attainment of eternal bliss by realizing the truth.  
How can you aspire for karmic results?   
V: Without proper understanding, many people are mad after heavenly  
enjoyments.   
Bh: One might think that heaven is a place of enjoyment. However, things are  
not very different from this world there. Attachments, prejudices, jealousies  
etc. are there too. That enjoyment too is perishable for everything is  
centered on the ego. Because of pleasures, one's mind would not then turn  
inward in search of truth.   
It is such a waste!   
After the good karma which gave one the enjoyments of heaven are over one has  
to return.   
What needs to be done is to inquire: 'for whom is this desire for heavenly  
enjoyment?' Such an inquiry is an absolute necessity.   
V: People wrongly superimpose permanence on heavenly enjoyments.   
Bh: How can it be? Everlasting bliss can be obtained only by eliminating the  
cycle of birth and death. Heaven is not the place for the realization of  
truth.   
V: It means that we should not aspire for the fruits of actions but surrender  
them to God. This also implies we should make an attempt to attain self-  
knowledge here and now.   
Bh: We do not know where heaven is nor as to how it is.   
But we aspire for unknown things. In contrast, all the requirements for self-  
knowledge is ready at hand.   
Why bother about unknown things when the wise ones   
have shown us the way to attain Self-knowledge here itself?

Atmavichar/Friends,   
"Annamalai Swami: Yes, yes. The 'I am the body' thought is just as poisonous  
as a cobra. 'All is my Self.' 'All is the nectar of my own Self.' _These are  
the great affirmations that counter the 'I am the body' thought_.   
Holding on to one of these sayings is the equal of millions of punyas. If we  
continuously meditate on the truth of these statements, **if we hold on to the  
truth that they are pointing towards**, countless punyas will accrue to us.   
One who is clear on Vichara will not see any difference between what  
Bhagavan is pointing out and what Annamalai Swami is pointing out.   
What Annamalai swami is pointing out is to give up wrong identification...The  
Root thought is 'I am the Body' identification...To recognize this and give it  
up is vichara...The 'I am the Self' is not intended to be repeated mindlessly  
but as a useful 'Reminder' to counter the 'I am the Body' thought...i.e to  
stop the identification in its tracks as it were.   
This is how Sri Ramakrishna points out the same Truth through the parable of  
the grass eating tiger: Parable of the grass-eating tiger   
Master:"Before you came here, you didn't know who you were. Now you will know.  
It is God who, as the guru, makes one know.   
"Nangta told the story of the tigress and the herd of goats. Once a tigress  
attacked a herd of goats. A hunter saw her from a distance and killed her. The  
tigress was pregnant and gave birth to a cub as she expired. The cub began to  
grow in the company of the goats. At first it was nursed by the she-goats, and  
later on, as it grew bigger, it began to eat grass and bleat like the goats.  
Gradually the cub became a big tiger; but still it ate grass and bleated.   
When attacked by other animals, it would run away, like the goats. One day a  
fierce looking tiger attacked the herd. It was amazed to see a tiger in the  
herd eating grass and running away with the goats at its approach. It left the  
goats and caught hold of the grass-eating tiger, which began to bleat and  
tried to run away. But the fierce tiger dragged it to the water and said: 'Now  
look at your face in the water. You see, you have the pot-face of a tiger; it  
is exactly like mine.' Next it pressed a piece of meat into its mouth. At  
first the grass-eating tiger refused to eat the meat. Then it got the taste of  
the meat and relished it.   
At last the fierce tiger said to the grass-eater: 'What a disgrace! You lived  
with goats and ate grass like them!' And the other was really ashamed of  
itself.   
" _Eating grass is like enjoying 'woman and gold'. To bleat and run away like  
a goat is to behave like an ordinary man. Going away with the new tiger is  
like taking shelter with the guru, who awakens one's spiritual consciousness,  
and recognizing him alone as one's relative. To see one's face rightly is to  
know one's real Self._"   
Sri Ramakrishna stood up. There was silence all around, disturbed only the by  
the gentle rustling of the pine-needles and the murmuring of the Ganges. The  
Master went to the Panchavati and then to his room, talking all the while with  
M. The disciple followed him,fascinated.

Dear Sri Ravi   
Thanks for your reply. Today I was going through the "Daily Readings" of  
Swami Sivananda and today's message was the same as quoted above i.e root  
cause of all problems is "Identification with the body,mind"

**THE ONLY MEANS**   
M: The attempt to destroy the ego or the mind through sadhanas other than atma  
vichara, is just like the thief assuming the guise of a policeman to catch the  
thief, that is himself. Atma vichara alone can reveal the truth that neither  
the ego nor the mind really exists, and enables one to realize the pure,  
undifferentiated Being of the Self or the Absolute.   
Having realized the Self, nothing remains to be known, because it is perfect  
Bliss, it is the All.   
D: In this life beset with limitations can I ever realize the bliss of the  
Self?   
M: That bliss of the Self is always with you, and you will find it for  
yourself if you would seek it earnestly.   
The cause of your misery is not in the life without; it is in you as the ego.  
You impose limitations on yourself and then make a vain struggle to transcend  
them.   
All unhappiness is due to the ego; with it comes all your trouble. What does  
it avail you to attribute to the happenings in life the cause of misery which  
is really within you? What happiness can you get from things extraneous to  
yourself? When you get it, how long will it last?   
If you would deny the ego and scorch it by ignoring it, you would be free. If  
you accept it, it will impose limitations on you and throw you into a vain  
struggle to transcend them. That was how the thief sought to ?ruin? King  
Janaka.   
To be the Self that you really are is the only means to realize the bliss that  
is ever yours.   
Maharshi?s Gospel, P. 52**

**CONVERSATIONS WITH ANNAMALAI SWAMI**   
Most people take the appearance of the snake in the rope to be reality. Acting  
on their misperceptions they think up many different ways of killing the  
snake. They can never succeed in getting rid of the snake until they give up  
the idea that there is a snake there at all.   
People who want to kill or control the mind have the same problem: they  
imagine that there is a mind which needs to be controlled and take drastic  
steps to beat it into submission. **If instead, they generated the  
understanding that there is no such thing as mind, all their problems would  
come to an end. You must generate the conviction,**   
'I am the all-pervasive consciousness in which all bodies and minds in the  
world are appearing and disappearing. I am that consciousness which remains  
unchanged and unaffected by these appearances and disappearances.'   
 **Stabilize yourself in that conviction. That is all you need to do.**   
 **LWB, p. 266**

**NO ONE SUCCEEDS WITHOUT EFFORT**   
D.: How can the rebellious mind be brought under control?   
M.: Either seek its source so that it may disappear or surrender that it may  
be struck down.   
D.: But the mind slips away from our control.   
M.: Be it so. Do not think of it. When you recollect yourself bring it back  
and turn it inward. That is enough.   
No one succeeds without effort. **Mind control is not one?s birthright. The  
successful few owe their success to their perseverance.**   
A passenger in a train keeps his load on the head by his own folly. Let him  
put it down: he will find the load reaches the destination all the same.  
Similarly, let us not pose as the doers, but resign ourselves to the guiding  
Power.

**From: ~~~ Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi, Talk 328.**   
 **Q.: Sri Bhagavan has said that the japa  
must be traced to its source.   
Is it not the mind that is meant?**   
M.: All these are only the workings of the mind.   
Japa helps to fix the mind on a single thought.   
All other thoughts are first subordinated   
until they disappear.   
When it becomes mental it is called dhyana.   
Dhyana is your true nature.   
It is however called dhyana   
because it is made with effort.   
Effort is necessary   
so long as thoughts   
are promiscuous.   
Because you are with other thoughts,   
you call the continuity of a single thought

**From: ~~~ Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi, Talk 328.**   
 **Q.: Sri Bhagavan has said that the japa  
must be traced to its source.   
Is it not the mind that is meant?**   
M.: All these are only the workings of the mind.   
Japa helps to fix the mind on a single thought.   
All other thoughts are first subordinated   
until they disappear.   
When it becomes mental it is called dhyana.   
Dhyana is your true nature.   
It is however called dhyana   
because it is made with effort.   
Effort is necessary   
so long as thoughts   
are promiscuous.   
Because you are with other thoughts,   
you call the continuity of a single thought   
meditation or dhyana.   
If that dhyana becomes effortless   
it will be found to be your real nature.

**CONVERSATIONS WITH ANNAMALAI SWAMI   
This waking life is just a long dream which keeps our attention away from what  
we really are. If you take the attitude that all the happenings in the world  
are dream events, your mind becomes tranquil. It is only when you take the  
dream world to be real that you get agitated.   
Q: I feel strongly that life is a long dream but I cannot see through the  
dream. For many years it has been like this.   
AS: If you really believed that all life was a dream, nothing in the world  
would ever trouble you. If you still have problems and worries, like not being  
able to see through the dream, it means that you have still not completely  
ceased to identify with what temporarily appears in your consciousness.   
You should enquire, 'Who is not able to penetrate through the dream??   
The true ?I? is not identified with the dream. If you don't forget your real  
Self, waking, dreaming and sleeping do not affect you.   
The things around you are always changing, but what we really ARE remains  
changeless.

?All is well, and everything is unfolding as it should. There are no mistakes.  
None have ever been made, none are being made, and none will ever be made. Its  
all perception. It?s how you perceive things. For instance, when you look at  
me what do you see? If I ask each one of you I get seven, eight, nine  
different answers, but the truth is you are seeing yourself. I am simply a  
mirror for your own reflection, but I am a self-contained mirror. So all this  
is taking place as an image on myself. All of life experiences are images on  
the screen of eternity. The screen is real. The images change. Consciousness  
is the screen. When you identify with consciousness you become consciousness.  
When you identify with the image you enhance the image, and you worry, and  
fret, and fear and you have all sorts of experiences.   
As soon as you begin to identify with reality, with consciousness, all fear  
leaves you, all doubt leaves you, all false thinking leaves you, and you  
become free. But that?s the only free choice you get. Everything else has been  
preordained.   
The free choice again is: with what are you going to identify, with the image  
or the screen? If you identify with consciousness you are no longer reacting  
to conditions, because you understand that all things are for a short time  
only, then they disappear. Consequently nothing will irritate you, nothing  
will upset you, nothing will bother you for you are now appearing as only an  
image and will soon disappear.   
Look at this planet which has been here for billions of years. There have been  
civilizations on this planet for billions of years, and they come and go. We  
had civilizations on this planet that surpassed our existence today. They are  
all gone. No trace. As a matter of fact, a couple of years ago there were some  
excavations in Egypt of a city that was buried about 5,000 years ago. The only  
thing left is a sign. They deciphered the sign and it said, ?My name is King  
so-and-so, and this is my city that will last forever.?   
So today we think we are going to make this a better world in which to live,  
and we are going to save the world, and so on. The world has it?s own  
collective karma. It?s going through a phase. Your job is to save yourself. If  
you find yourself in a burning building, you do not stop to admire the  
pictures on the wall, you get out of the building as fast as you can. So, when  
you know you have a short time in this existence you do not stop to play the  
games of life, you try to find yourself and become free as fast as you can?.?

?Please do not build a stupa for me. Please do not put my ashes in a vase,  
lock me inside, and limit who I am. I know this will be difficult for some of  
you. If you must build a stupa though, please make sure that you put a sign on  
it that says, ?I am not in here.? In addition, you can also put another sign  
that says, ?I am not out there either,? and a third sign that says, ?If I am  
anywhere, it is in your mindful breathing and in your peaceful steps.?

atmavichar,   
There is no such a thing as a 'Real person'...Each 'Person' carries an image  
of himself with which he identifies. ..and another 'person' may carry another  
'image' of that...A Sadhaka has to learn to recognize and have the attitude  
that what is 'Real' in him is 'Real' in the other 'Person' as well...that one  
Reality alone manifests as the many.   
Namaskar

I presented to the Maharshi the Awadhoota Gita and the Ashtavakra Gita and  
drew His attention to the first verse of the Awadhoota Gita, which says : "It  
is only through the grace of God that in men with knowledge is born a desire  
to experience cosmic unity, a desire which protects them from the great  
dangers of Samsara (worldly life)."   
With infinite compassion in His eyes the Maharshi looked at me and instructed  
one of the followers to bring a book. This was the Maha Bhakta Vijayam.  
Bhagavan opened the book and began to read. (I noted with awe that the book  
opened exactly at the page where He intended to read.)   
The look, which the Maharshi gives you, is a question. At least I felt it so.  
The question is: "I see a unity, but you keep grasping at the variety. Why  
don't you know yourself properly and realise your true Self?". Nothing is so  
helpful as the august presence of the Maharshi for those who seriously intend  
to progress on the spiritual path.   
There is spiritual communication and kindliness in His looks, eliciting what  
is best in a person. His presence acts as a catalyst, enabling us to secure  
our spiritual yearning. There is grace and benignity in the way He looks at  
the devotees as mother looks at her children.

CONSCIOUS IMMORTALITY   
Free Will and Karma   
Questions of fate and free will arise only to those who fail to look into the  
root of both. To know the cause is never to enter?tain thoughts of either fate  
or free will.   
Everything in this universe is run by one Supreme Power, but if people will  
not keep to the destined path appointed for them, but stray beyond its limits,  
then God punishes them and through that they turn towards the Self.   
But when the punish?ment finishes, they stop worshipping and sin again,  
thereby inviting an increased punishment. Agitation or anxiety is a sign of  
having strayed from destiny, whereas on the appointed path they will remain

**Worship of Form and Formless**   
\   
Devotee: Saguna upasana (worship of form with attributes) is said to be  
imperfect. It is also said that nirguna upasana (worship of formless) is hard  
and risky.   
Maharshi: The Saguna merges into the Nirguna in the long run. The Saguna  
purifies the mind and takes one to the final goal. The afflicted one, the  
seeker of knowledge, and the seeker of gains (wordly) are all dear to God. But  
the Jnani is the Self of God.

Leave people alone. Do not try to change people or to make them see your point

get rid of points of view.

**Morarji Desai, Prime Minister of India (March 1977 to July 1979), was  
President of Ramana Kendra, Delhi, 1968-70.**   
I had the privilege of seeing Ramana Maharshi in August 1935 in the hall in  
which he usually sat. He was sitting on a sofa and wore only a loincloth. I  
could see an aura on his face, which was glowing with peace and joy. I sat  
opposite to him but did not ask him anything. He too did not say anything to  
me. I sat just over an hour and just looked at his face. Till today I have not  
seen that aura, that joy or peace on anybody else?s face. That hour of perfect  
stillness in that silent presence has been a precious memory ever since.   
While I sat there, no questions arose in my mind, nor did I feel any desire to  
ask anything. I was at complete peace with myself. It was this experience that  
convinced me that Ramana Maharshi had realized God or Truth. Some of his  
disciples who were present asked him some questions, which he answered. He,  
however, said nothing of his own accord.   
I had to leave the place next day by train at about twelve. About an hour-  
and-a half before the time of departure, I approached Ramana Maharshi for  
permission to leave. He told me that I should go after I had eaten. We sat  
down for lunch along with the Maharshi, at about eleven O?clock. After lunch,  
I bowed down to him and left.   
The visit left an abiding impression on me and convinced me that Ramana  
Maharshi was a realized soul and that the ideal of ?action in inaction? as  
propounded in the Gita is really attainable.   
Presiding over the 99th Jayanti celebrations of Ramana Maharshi at Ramana  
Kendra, New Delhi, on 13th January 1979, Morarji Desai as Prime Minister,  
said: The Maharshi seemed to know everything. He knew the language of the animals.  
He listened to their complaints. He treated every being in the same way,  
whether it was a cow or a dog, a crow or a monkey. All were equal in his eyes,  
the beggar and the millionaire. He never went out of Tiruvannamalai. He  
refused to go out and preach. He said, ?If I am a jnani, I consider everybody  
else a jnani too. What is there to give?? He regarded everybody as himself. He  
made no attempt to convert anybody. One got transformed by his very presence.   
Many civilizations have flourished and then disappeared. But in this country,  
you find our old culture and the ancient religion still alive. And it is this  
that keeps the country alive. It is persons like the Maharshi who keep it  
alive...All learning should come from within. That is the way the Maharshi  
showed. He did not criticize other's way of life. He said, ?Stick to your own  
religion and follow it properly.? Ramana Maharshi taught that one could do  
sadhana in one?s chosen way and reach the goal.

Some jnanis may stay silent; others may talk a lot.   
Some are active in the world; some withdraw from it.   
Some end up as teachers while others are content to stay hidden.   
Some behave like saints, whereas others act like madmen.   
The same peace can be found in the presence of all these beings, since this  
peace is not affected by modes of behaviour, but there may be no other common  
factors.

Tayumanuvar, a Tamil saint whom Bhagavan often quoted, wrote in one of his  
poems: 'My Guru merely told me that I am consciousness. Having heard this, I  
held onto consciousness. What he told me was just one sentence, but I cannot  
describe the bliss I attained from holding onto that one simple sentence.  
Through that one sentence I attained a peace and a happiness that can never be  
explained in words'.

**THE HARIJAN LADY   
I once remember a Harijan lady who for the past twenty-five years was  
gathering honey to send to Sri Bhagavan. On every occasion she was unable to  
bring the honey herself and had to send it with someone. After waiting for  
twenty-five years, she finally found the opportunity to come. The poor lady  
was in tattered clothes, standing before Bhagavan. Her eyesight was poor and I  
still vividly recall the unusual way she looked at Sri Bhagavan, calling out  
"Oh Darling, where are you? I want to see you." Bhagavan in all his  
graciousness said, "Grandmother, look this way. I am here." Looking at the  
honey she had brought with her, he said to me, "They are Brahmins, they won't  
eat this. We will share it, and eat it."   
It is often said, Bhagavan did not give direct Upadesa (spiritual teaching),  
but what else is all this? Although Bhagavan repeatedly pointed out human  
frailty, people were not prepared to rectify themselves. As if talking to  
himself, he looked at this poor old woman in ragged clothes and said, "Poor  
lady, she must be hungry. And where will she go for clothes? Who will offer  
her food and clothes?" Upon hearing this, Ondu Reddiyar got up and said, "We  
will give her food and also see that some clothes are purchased." Then  
Reddiyar took the woman to the Dining Hall and fed her sumptuously. He also  
sent someone to town to buy her a sari. As the old woman had no money, she had  
walked a great distance to come here. Bhagavan knowing this, said in an  
impersonal way, "Would anyone be interested in getting her a bus ticket?"  
Reddiyar again came forward and said, "We will provide her with a bus ticket  
and see her off." When this lady returned from the Dining Hall she was  
touching the ground, and then touching her eyes. That is a way of prostration  
and thanksgiving.   
It is noteworthy that whenever the poor or untouchables came, Bhagavan took a  
very personal interest in them, which was a moving sight to see.

**Question: Why should Self-enquiry alone be considered the direct path to  
Realization?**   
 **Bhagavan:** Because every kind of path except Self-enquiry presupposes the  
retention of the mind as the instrument for following it, and cannot be  
followed without the mind. The ego may take different and more subtle forms at  
different stages of one's practice but it is never destroyed. The attempt to  
destroy the ego or the mind by methods other than Self-enquiry is like a thief  
turning policeman to catch the thief that is himself. Self enquiry alone can  
reveal the truth that neither the ego nor the mind really exists and enable  
one to realize the pure, undifferentiated Being of the Self or the Absolute.

**Question: I wasn?t here yesterday, but I was told that someone asked the  
following question: ?I have been following Bhagavan?s teachings for many  
years, but without any obvious benefits. I don?t feel any peace. What am I  
doing wrong? Why am I not getting results??**   
Annamalai Swami: Self-enquiry must be done continuously. It doesn?t work if  
you regard it as a part-time activity. You may be doing something that doesn?t  
hold your interest or attention, so you think, ?I will do some self-enquiry  
instead?. This is never going to work. You may go two steps forward when you  
practice, but you go five steps backward when you stop your practice and go  
back to your worldly affairs. You must have a lifelong commitment to establish  
yourself in the Self.   
Your determination to succeed must be strong and firm, and it should manifest  
as continuous, not part-time effort.For many lifetimes you have been immersed  
in ignorance. You are habituated to it.   
All your deeply rooted beliefs, all your patterns of behaviour reinforce  
ignorance and strengthen the hold it has over you. This ignorance is so  
strong, so deeply enmeshed in all your psychological structures, it takes a  
massive effort over a long period of time to break free from it.   
The habits and beliefs that sustain it have to be challenged again and again.   
Ignorance is ignorance of the Self, and to remove it Self- awareness is  
required. When you come to an awareness of the Self, ignorance vanishes. If  
you don?t lose contact with the Self, ignorance can never arise.   
If there is darkness, you remove it by bringing light. Darkness is not  
something real and substantial that you have to dig out and throw away. It is  
just an absence of light, nothing more. When light is let into a dark room,  
the darkness is suddenly no longer there. It did not vanish gradually or go  
away piece by piece; it simply ceased to exist when the room became filled  
with light.   
This is just an analogy because the Self is not like other lights. It is not  
an object that you either see or don?t see. It is there all the time, shining  
as your own reality. If you refuse to acknowledge its existence, if you refuse  
to believe that it is there, you put yourself in an imaginary darkness. It is  
not a real darkness. It is just your own wilful refusal to acknowledge that  
you are light itself. This self-inflicted ignorance is the darkness that has  
to be banished by the light of Self-awareness. We have repeatedly to turn to  
the light of the Self within until we become one with it.   
Bhagavan spoke about turning inwards to face the Self. That is all that is  
needed. If we look outwards, we become entangled with objects and we lose  
awareness of the Self shining within us. But when, by repeated practice, we  
gain the strength to keep our focus on the Self within, we become one with it  
and the darkness of Self-ignorance vanishes. Then, even though we continue to  
live in this false and unreal body, we abide in an ocean of bliss that never  
fades or diminishes.   
This is not going to happen in a moment because lifetimes of wrong and  
ignorant thinking have made it impossible for most of us to focus intently and  
regularly on the Self within. If you leave your house and start walking away  
from it, and if you continue this habit over many lives, you will probably be  
a long, long way from home when you finally decide that you have had enough  
and that you want to go back to where you started from. Don?t be discouraged  
by the length of the journey, and don?t slacken in your efforts to get home.   
Turn 180? to face the source of your outward journey, and keep moving back to  
where you started. Ignore the pain, the discomfort, and the frustration of  
seeming not to get anywhere. Keep moving back to your source, and don?t let  
anything distract you on the way. Be like the river on its journey back to the  
sea. It doesn?t stop, take diversions, or decide to flow uphill for a while.  
It doesn?t become distracted. It just moves slowly and steadily back to the  
place its water originated from. And when the river dissolves in the ocean,  
river is no more. Only ocean remains.   
Jiva [the individual self] came from Siva and has to go back to Siva again. If  
there is a big charcoal fire, and one burning ember jumps out, the fire in the  
ember will soon go out. To reignite it, you have to put it back into the fire,  
back into its burning source.   
There is no happiness in separation. Thejiva has no happiness, contentment or  
peace so long as it remains a separate being. The separate being comes from  
the Self. It has to go back there and end there. Only then will there be  
eternal peace.   
The energy of the mind comes from the Self. In the waking state the mind  
functions as a separate entity. In the sleep state it goes back to the source.  
Again and again it comes out and goes back. It does this because it doesn?t  
know the truth of what it really is. It is Self and Self alone, but its  
ignorance of this fact makes it miserable. It is this feeling of separateness  
that gives rise to desires, suffering and unhappiness.   
Keep the mind in the Self. If you can do this, you can live in peace both  
while you are awake and also while you are asleep. In deep sleep all  
differences are dropped. If you keep the mind in the Self during the waking  
state, there will also be no differences, no distinctions. You will see  
everything as your own Self

When I say, 'Meditate on the Self' I am asking you to be the Self, not think  
about it. Be aware of what remains when thoughts stop. Be aware of the  
consciousness that is the origin of all your thoughts. Be that consciousness.

**D.: Why does not Sri Bhagavan go about and preach the Truth to the people at  
large?**   
M.: How do you know that I am not doing it? Does preaching consist in mounting  
a platform and haranguing to the people around? Preaching is simple  
communication of knowledge. It may be done in Silence too.   
What do you think of a man listening to a harangue for an hour and going away  
without being impressed by it so as to change his life? Compare him with  
another who sits in a holy presence and leaves after some time with his  
outlook on life totally changed. Which is better: To preach loudly without  
effect or to sit silently sending forth intuitive forces to play on others?   
(Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi, talk no 285)   
Siva appeared before them sitting under the sacred banyan tree. Being yogiraja  
should He practise yoga? He went into samadhi as He sat; He was in Perfect  
Repose. Silence prevailed. They saw Him. The effect was immediate. They fell  
into samadhi and their doubts were at an end.   
Silence is the true upadesa. It is the perfect upadesa. It is suited only for  
the most advanced seeker. The others are unable to draw full inspiration from  
it. Therefore they require words to explain the Truth. But Truth is beyond  
words. It does not admit of explanation.

**Very important message to detach the I am the Doer attitude and to reduce  
misery and fear but this must not be used as an excuse to do Adharmic  
activities or become lazy and Tamasic**   
Q : I can understand that the outstanding events in a man's life, such as his  
country, nationality, family, career or profession, marriage, death, etc., are  
all predestined by his karma, but can it be that all the details of his life,  
down to the minutest, have already been determined ? Now, for instance, I put  
this fan that is in my hand down on the floor here. Can it be that it was  
already decided that on such and such a day, at such and such an hour, I  
should move the fan like this and put it down here ?   
BHAGAVAN : Certainly.   
Whatever this body is to do and whatever experiences it is to pass through was  
already decided when it came into existence.

**Natesa Iyer served Bhagavan and devotees working as a cook at Sri  
Ramanasramam for years. The below is what he told Swami Ramanananda:**   
?I was Bhagavan?s attendant,? he would say, ?when he had one of his cancer  
operations. In those few hours, I understood directly what Bhagavan meant when  
he said, ?I am not the body?. His behavior throughout the operation showed  
very clearly that the body was just something that he was wearing. The flesh  
was being cut, blood was flowing, and I could see the radium needles that had  
been inserted into the flesh around the cancer. Bhagavan was fully conscious  
but utterly indifferent to the procedures that were being carried out on his  
arm. I was told afterwards that we were in the room with him for 2.5 ? 3  
hours, but while we were with him there was no awareness whatsoever of the  
passage of time. We were all consumed by the power of Bhagavan?s silence. Even  
the doctors were sucked into it. When the operation had been completed, the  
doctors spontaneously prostrated to Bhagavan.   
?One of them said, ?I have operated on many people, but I have never had an  
experience like this. There is a peace in this room that I have never felt  
anywhere else. I cannot describe what it was like except to say that it was  
unlike anything I have ever experienced before.?   
?I think the doctor spoke for us all. Bhagavan, abiding untroubled and  
unconcerned in his natural state of silence, gave us all an immense blessing  
while he was being cut open by the medical team. It was an awesome display of  
power and grace that left me in tears.   
?After an operation like this, one would expect a patient to want quiet and  
rest, but Bhagavan showed a complete indifference to his body and to the  
advice of his medical team. Overruling the doctors and the ashram management,  
he announced that he wanted to give darshan to all the devotees who were  
waiting anxiously outside. As the people filed past him one by one, Bhagavan  
made inquiries about the health and well-being of the devotees but refused to  
talk about his own physical state. If people asked about his operation and the  
state of his health, he would smile but not give any answer.?

You are here because there is a desire in you to realise the Self. This desire  
does not arise randomly or accidentally in some people and not in others. It  
is there because of the punyas you have accumulated from previous births,  
punyas that may have come from meditation, charitable work, and so on. These  
punyas will manifest as a desire for freedom, a desire to do earnest sadhana,  
a desire to find a good teacher in whose presence the truth will be taught and  
revealed. If someone is destined to be a jnani in this life, it means that he  
had come to this final birth with a mountain of punyas to his credit. These  
punyas will take him to the real Guru, to a real satsang, and in this  
environment he will do sadhana and achieve the goal.   
If one does not have this mountain of punyas from the past, there will be no  
desire for freedom, no desire to look for a Guru who can deliver it. Such a  
person may meet a Guru and that Guru may even give him good advice, but the  
determined resolve to put that advice in to effect will not be there. The  
fierce determination to succeed and discrimination that allows one to ignore  
worldly entanglements only arise in those who have accumulated these punyas.  
Other people may hear the worlds of truth, but although they accept that they  
are true, the inclination to act on them will not be there.

An elderly man from Ananthapur, after hearing the Vedas recited in the hall,  
stood up and asked: ?It is said that the non-Brahmins should not hear the recital of the Vedas.?   
M.: Mind your business. Take care of what you came here for. Why do you waste  
your time in these matters? ?I heard the recital,? you say. ?Who is that ?I??  
Without knowing the ?I? you are using the word. If its significance be known  
there will be no doubt. Find the ?I? first and you may afterwards speak of  
other matters.?   
Continuing, Sri Bhagavan said: ?The smritis say something. They are not appropriate now. I will reform the  
world, rewrite the smritis.? Saying so, people are cutting capers in the world  
from time immemorial. Such reformers have come and gone; but the ancient  
smritis still stand. Why waste time over such matters? Let each one mind his  
business.   
All will be well.

**CONVERSATIONS WITH ANNAMALAI SWAMI   
PRACTICAL SADHANA MUST BE STEADY**   
Q: It is so difficult to avoid getting entangled in the mind. Staying detached  
from thoughts is like trying to stop the tide from coming in. Waves of new  
thoughts wash away the detached observer every few seconds.   
AS: Self-enquiry must be done repeatedly and steadily. The wandering mind  
slowly loses its energy when it is subjected to constant scrutiny. The mind  
derives all its energy from the attention you give to thoughts and emotions.  
If you refuse to give them any attention and instead challenge each thought as  
soon as it appears, sooner or later your attention will stop going out to all  
your stray thoughts.   
When the attractiveness of transient thoughts diminishes to the point where  
you no longer feel obliged to hold on to them whenever they appear, you will  
be able to rest quietly in the experience of your real nature without being  
distracted.

**CONVERSATIONS WITH ANNAMALAI SWAMI**   
 **DO NOT CLING TO BLISSFUL STATES**   
Q: I know that Bhagavan is within all forms but sometimes I feel that it is  
easier to feel his grace by concentrating on an image of him.   
Self-inquiry is such hard work. One rarely feels blissful or peaceful doing  
it. Sometimes I feel like treating myself to a little bliss by looking at  
Bhagavan's picture for a while.   
AS: There is nothing wrong with looking at Bhagavan's picture. It is a very  
good practice. But you should not get sidetracked from your main objective  
which is establishing yourself as consciousness. Don't get attached to states  
of bliss or give them priority over the quest for the Self. If you become  
attached to peaceful or blissful states you may lose interest in your main  
quest.   
It is good to feel blissful and peaceful but don't indulge yourself in these  
states at the expense of self-inquiry. If you realize the inner Self, if you  
realize that there is not an atom which is apart from the Self, you will  
experience the real peace and bliss of the Self.   
You will BE the peace and bliss rather than being the experiencer of it. If  
you enjoy temporary states of peace and bliss in the mind, the experiencer of  
that peace and bliss will not want to subside into the Self and disappear.   
Don't get attached to mental peace. Go beyond it to the real peace which comes  
from being the Self.

**MY LIFE WITH BHAGAVAN**   
My life with Bhagavan taught me the value of faith, obedience, and surrender.  
When I obeyed Bhagavan?s words or had complete faith that he would look after  
all my spiritual and physical needs, everything went well. When I tried to  
mold my own destiny (such as the time I went to live in the cave and the time  
I ran away to Polur) things went badly. Life?s lessons have thus taught me the  
value and the necessity of complete surrender.   
If one surrenders completely to Bhagavan; if one lives by his words, ignoring  
all others; if one has enough faith in Bhagavan to stop making plans about the  
future; if one can banish all doubts and worries by having faith in Bhagavan?s  
omnipotence ? then, and only then, Bhagavan will bend and mold one?s  
circumstances, transforming them in such a way that one?s spiritual and  
physical needs are always satisfied.

Disciple: After chatting for some time, in the course of conversation, I told  
the Mother, "Mother, you are Mahamaya; you have nicely deluded us by bestowing  
parents, husbands, and children on us."   
The Mother( Sarada Devi ) immediately replied,   
"Don't speak like this - that I have kept others deluded! The sufferings of  
people bound in the world pain me very much. But what can I do, my child? They  
don't seek liberation"

**Anxiety Is The Creation Of The Mind**   
Mr. Phillips, an Englishman who used to be a missionary and is now a teacher  
and who has been about 20 years in Hyderabad, came this morning. He said : ?I  
lost my son in the war. What is the way for his salvation?"   
Bhagavan was silent for a while and then replied. ?Your worry is due to  
thinking. Anxiety is a creation of the mind. Your real nature is peace. Peace  
has not got to be achieved; it is our nature. To find consolation, you may  
reflect : 'God gave, God has taken away; He knows best'. But the true remedy  
is to enquire into your true nature. It is because you feel that your son does  
not exist that you feel grief. If you knew that he existed you would not feel  
grief. That means that the source of the grief is mental and not an actual  
reality. There is a story given in some books how two boys went on a  
pilgrimage and after some days news came back that one of them was dead.  
However, the wrong one was reported dead, and the result was that the mother  
who had lost her son went about as cheerful as ever, while the one who had  
still got her son was weeping and lamenting. So it is not any object or  
condition that causes grief but only our thought about it. Your son came from  
the Self and was absorbed back into the Self. Before he was born, where was he  
apart from the Self? He is our Self in reality. In deep sleep the thought of  
'I' or 'child' or 'death' does not occur to you, and you are the same person  
who existed in sleep. If you enquire in this way and find out your real  
nature, you will know your son's real nature also. He always exists. It is  
only you who think he is lost. You create a son in your mind, and think that  
he is lost, but in the Self he always exists."

**A. Devaraja Mudaliar, a lawyer, used to address Sri Ramana as ?my father and  
mother? and sign as Ramana?s child ? Ramana Sei. He authored the famous Day by  
Day with Bhagavan and My Recollections of Bhagavan Sri Ramana.**   
From about 1936, I used to go to Bhagavan regularly, once almost every month,  
and stay at the Ashram for three to five days each time. In 1937, I had a  
remarkable proof of Bhagavan?s grace ? my office (i.e., the Official  
Receiver?s Office, Chittoor) was audited, and as a result of a stupid mistake  
of my clerk, there was a deficit of Rs.70 in the cash balance. I paid the  
amount as soon as I was told it was missing. If the authorities had taken a  
strict legal view they could have called the mistake temporary  
misappropriation. I was terribly upset because I always had a great name for  
integrity and was afraid it would be damaged. That night Bhagavan appeared in  
my dream as a young Brahmin, very handsome and valiant in appearance, and  
easily, without any effort, picked up a big snake that was approaching me and  
put it aside. The audit report did not cause me any harm and my explanation of  
its being the clerk?s mistake was accepted without any further remark.   
I gave up my legal practice in 1939 and decided to live in the Ashram, where I  
was allowed to build a one-room cottage. Such permission was rarely given and  
had been given only to Major Chadwick and Yogi Ramaiah.   
One day, a piece of grit got into my eye. Dr. G. S. Melkote, a devotee from  
Hyderabad, examined the eye and said that the grit had got fixed and he would  
have to take me to the hospital at Tiruvannamalai and if that failed, to  
Madras, or the eye would be permanently damaged.   
I was thoroughly upset and was telling Bhagavan mentally, ?I came here to have  
a quiet time and enjoy the peace and happiness of your company. Is it your  
will that all this should happen?? Then I told Dr. Melkote, ?Let me put a drop  
of castor oil and see if the lubrication will discharge the grit.? He agreed.  
We went to Bhagavan?s hall. I prostrated before him, without telling him  
anything. Then I took a little castor oil from Bhagavan?s attendant and left  
for my room along with the doctor. By the time we reached the corner, I felt a  
distinct relief. When we got to the room he examined the eye and found nothing  
there. He then said, ?I cannot explain how the grit disappeared. It is clearly  
the work of your Bhagavan.?   
After a stay of one or two days at the Ashram, I found that the food there did  
not suit me. This apart, I generally took a very small quantity of rice. Once  
Bhagavan observing my leaf-plate, asked, ?How do you manage with so little  
food?? I replied, ?Even when I take so little my stomach gives trouble after  
one or two days. I cannot properly digest even this quantity.? Bhagavan kept  
quiet, but thereafter I had no more trouble with my stomach even when I stayed  
continuously in the Ashram and took all the meals.   
Because of the poor health of my daughter and of the interval of about ten  
years since her previous confinement, I was extremely anxious about her  
delivery. The medical assistance available at her husband?s place was minimal.  
I communicated all this anxiety to Bhagavan through a letter. I got a reply  
from the Ashram that I need not be anxious and that my daughter would have a  
safe delivery. This was not the sort of reply that was usually sent from the  
Ashram. What was usual was something like the following: ?We hope that by  
Bhagavan?s Grace the confinement will be safe.? I came back to the Ashram  
telling my son-in-law that I would be of no particular use there and to wire  
me if there was need. After I had been with Bhagavan for two or three days, I  
got a letter from my son-in-law stating that my daughter?s delivery was safe  
and smooth.   
About the end of 1946, I got a call from my brother to help him in a certain  
case between him and another close relation of ours in a court at Madras. I  
earnestly prayed to Bhagavan that the case should end without any trial. I  
wrote to Bhagavan that it was humiliating for me when close relations have  
proceedings in the court and our domestic concerns get exposed. I was mentally  
very anxious that the case should not come up for trial. But both parties were  
stubborn and cantankerous and a compromise was very improbable. Still,  
Bhagavan?s grace did not fail; the case ended without any trial, but on  
account of a circumstance which I could never have dreamt of: the party who  
had complained against my brother and his advocate were both absent when the  
case was called, and so the complaint was dismissed.   
A whole volume could be written describing how Bhagavan practiced samatva  
(equality) and taught us constantly by his example. In his presence all were  
alike, high or low, rich or poor, man or woman, child or adult, human or  
animal. Just as he himself treated all alike, he would never tolerate any  
special consideration or attention being shown to him more than to any other  
in the Ashram.   
Many a time it happened that if he observed even a little excess in what was  
served to him of any dish or any delicacy above the quantity served to others,  
he would flare up with indignation and rebuke whoever was responsible. He used  
to say, ?By doing such a thing you are disgracing me. There cannot be a  
greater disgrace than this.?   
Once a visiting European lady was sitting opposite to Bhagavan in the hall.  
Being unaccustomed to squatting on the floor with legs crossed, she stretched  
out her legs in front. One of the attendants considered this disrespectful to  
Bhagavan and asked her to fold her legs. The poor lady felt that whereas she  
came to show respect she had done something disrespectful, and I had the  
impression that she almost wept with chagrin.   
Bhagavan who reads the hearts and not acts felt unhappy for the distress  
caused to the lady. He told her there was no harm in sitting as was most  
comfortable to her, however, she could not be persuaded again to do so.   
Bhagavan himself was stretching out his legs on the couch since rheumatism in  
his knees had made it painful to sit cross-legged for more than a short time.  
However, he now sat up cross-legged and could not be persuaded to relax again  
the whole day. He said, ?If it is a rule for her, it is a rule for all. I too  
should not stretch out my legs.? However much we begged Bhagavan not to take  
notice of a foolish act on the part of an attendant, he could not be dissuaded  
at all. It was only the next day that we succeeded in getting him to stretch  
out his legs as usual whenever he felt like it.

Atma Vichar/Friends,   
Came across this post by Atmavichar in another thread: If you are filled with anger, you create more suffering for yourself than for  
the other person. When you are inhabited by the energy of anger, you want to  
punish, you want to destroy. That is why those who are wise do not want to say  
anything or do anything while the anger is still in them. So you try to bring  
peace into yourself first. When you are calm, when you are lucid, you will see  
that the other person is a victim of confusion, of hate, of violence  
transmitted by society, by parents, by friends, by the environment. When you  
are able to see that, your anger is no longer there. - THICH NHAT HANH   
As long as we see 'another' (i.e identify ourselves with the ego ) Anger and  
all the rest like lust,jealousy avarice will continue...seeing the other  
person as a 'victim' may give a temporary consolation but the 'tendency' or  
vasana is not eradicated. ..it will again spring up at the next provocation.   
The only straight forward approach is not to look for causes outside of  
oneself for such infirmities and turn the attention on why they arise in the  
first place...it is on account of our taking ourselves as a 'Person' and let  
this idea take hold of ourselves...To disassociate from this idea is the only  
way...There is no other way.

**_God in Everything_**  
 _We have seen how the greater portion of our life must of necessity be filled  
with evils, however we may resist, and that this mass of evil is practically  
almost infinite for us. We have been struggling to remedy this since the  
beginning of time, yet everything remains very much the same. The more we  
discover remedies, the more we find ourselves beset by subtler evils. We have  
also seen that all religions propose a God, as the one way of escaping these  
difficulties. All religions tell us that if you take the world as it is, as  
most practical people would advise us to do in this age, then nothing would be  
left to us but evil. They further assert that there is something beyond this  
world. This life in the five senses, life in the material world, is not all;  
it is only a small portion, and merely superficial. Behind and beyond is the  
Infinite in which there is no more evil. Some people call It God, some Allah,  
some Jehovah, Jove, and so on. The Vedantin calls It Brahman.   
The first impression we get of the advice given by religions is that we had  
better terminate our existence. To the question how to cure the evils of life,  
the answer apparently is, give up life. It reminds one of the old story. A  
mosquito settled on the head of a man, and a friend, wishing to kill the  
mosquito, gave it such a blow that he killed both man and mosquito. The remedy  
of evil seems to suggest a similar course of action. Life is full of ills, the  
world is full of evils; that is a fact no one who is old enough to know the  
world can deny.   
But what is remedy proposed by all the religions? That this world is nothing.  
Beyond this world is something which is very real. Here comes the difficulty.  
The remedy seems to destroy everything. How can that be a remedy? Is there no  
way out then? The Vedanta says that what all the religions advance is  
perfectly true, but it should be properly understood. Often it is  
misunderstood, because the religions are not very clear in their meaning. What  
we really want is head and heart combined. The heart is great indeed; it is  
through the heart that come the great inspirations of life. I would a hundred  
times rather have a little heart and no brain, than be all brains and no  
heart. Life is possible, progress is possible for him who has heart, but he  
who has no heart and only brains dies of dryness.   
At the same time we know that he who is carried along by his heart alone has  
to undergo many ills, for now and then he is liable to tumble into pitfalls.  
The combination of heart and head is what we want. I do not mean that a man  
should compromise his heart for his brain or vice versa, but let everyone have  
an infinite amount of heart and feeling, and at the same time an infinite  
amount of reason. Is there any limit to what we want in this world? Is not the  
world infinite? There is room for an infinite amount of feeling, and so also  
for an infinite amount of culture and reason. Let them come together without  
limit, let them be running together, as it were, in parallel lines each with  
the other.   
Most of the religions understand the fact, but the error into which they all  
seem to fall is the same; they are carried away by the heart, the feelings.  
There is evil in the world, give up the world; that is the great teaching, and  
the only teaching, no doubt. Give up the world. There cannot be two opinions  
that to understand the truth everyone of us has to give up error. There cannot  
be two opinions that everyone of us in order to have good must give up evil;  
there cannot be two opinions that everyone of us to have life must give up  
what is death.   
And yet, what remains to us, if this theory involves giving up the life of the  
senses, the life as we know it? And what else do we mean by life? If we give  
this up, what remains?   
We shall understand this better, when, later on, we come to the more  
philosophical portions of the Vedanta. But for the present I beg to state that  
in Vedanta alone we find a rational solution of the problem. Here I can only  
lay before you what the Vedanta seeks to teach, and that is the deification of  
the world. The Vedanta does not in reality denounce the world. The ideal of  
renunciation nowhere attains such a height as in the teachings of the Vedanta.  
But, at the same time, dry suicidal advice is not intended; it really means  
deification of the world ? giving up the world as we think of it, as we know  
it, as it appears to us ? and to know what it really is. Deify it; it is God  
alone. We read at the commencement of one of the oldest of the Upanishads,   
"Whatever exists in this universe is to be covered with the Lord."   
We have to cover everything with the Lord Himself, not by a false sort of  
optimism, not by blinding our eyes to the evil, but by really seeing God in  
everything. Thus we have to give up the world, and when the world is given up,  
what remains? God. What is meant? You can have your wife; it does not mean  
that you are to abandon her, but that you are to see God in the wife. Give up  
your children; what does that mean? To turn them out of doors, as some human  
brutes do in every country? Certainly not. That is diabolism; it is not  
religion. But see God in your children. So, in everything. In life and in  
death, in happiness and in misery, the Lord is equally present. The whole  
world is full of the Lord. Open your eyes and see Him. This is what Vedanta  
teaches. Give up the world which you have conjectured, because your conjecture  
was based upon a very partial experience, upon very poor reasoning, and upon  
your own weakness. Give it up; the world we have been thinking of so long, the  
world to which we have been clinging so long, is a false world of our own  
creation. Give that up; open your eyes and see that as such it never existed;  
it was a dream, Maya. What existed was the Lord Himself. It is He who is in  
the child, in the wife, and in the husband; it is He who is in the good and in  
the bad; He is in the sin and in the sinner; He is in life and in death.   
A tremendous assertion indeed! Yet that is the theme which the Vedanta wants  
to demonstrate, to teach, and to preach. This is just the opening theme.   
Thus we avoid the dangers of life and its evils. Do not desire anything. What  
makes us miserable? The cause of all miseries from which we suffer is desire.  
You desire something, and the desire is not fulfilled; the result is distress.  
If there is no desire, there is no suffering. But here, too, there is the  
danger of my being misunderstood. So it is necessary to explain what I mean by  
giving up desire and becoming free from all misery. The walls have no desire  
and they never suffer. True, but they never evolve. This chair has no desires,  
it never suffers; but it is always a chair. There is a glory in happiness,  
there is a glory in suffering. If I may dare to say so, there is a utility in  
evil too. The great lesson in misery we all know. There are hundreds of things  
we have done in our lives which we wish we had never done, but which, at the  
same time, have been great teachers. As for me, I am glad I have done  
something good and many things bad; glad I have done something right, and glad  
I have committed many errors, because every one of them has been a great  
lesson. I, as I am now, am the resultant of all I have done, all I have  
thought. Every action and thought have had their effect, and these effects are  
the sum total of my progress.   
We all understand that desires are wrong, but what is meant by giving up  
desires? How could life go on? It would be the same suicidal advice, killing  
the desire and the man too. The solution is this. Not that you should not have  
property, not that you should not have things which are necessary and things  
which are even luxuries. Have all that you want, and more, only know the truth  
and realise it. Wealth does not belong to anybody. Have no idea of  
proprietorship, possessorship. You are nobody, nor am I, nor anyone else. All  
belongs to the Lord, because the opening verse told us to put the Lord in  
everything. God is in the wealth that you enjoy. He is in the desire that  
rises in your mind. He is in the things you buy to satisfy your desire; He is  
in your beautiful attire, in your beautiful ornaments. This is the line of  
thought. All will be metamorphosed as soon as you begin to see things in that  
light. If you put God in your every movement, in your conversation, in your  
form, in everything, the whole scene changes, and the world, instead of  
appearing as one of woe and misery, will become a heaven.   
"The kingdom of heaven is within you," says Jesus; so says the Vedanta, and  
every great teacher. "He that hath eyes to see, let him see, and he that hath  
ears to hear, let him hear." The Vedanta proves that the truth for which we  
have been searching all this time is present, and was all the time with us. In  
our ignorance, we thought we had lost it, and went about the world crying and  
weeping, struggling to find the truth, while all along it was dwelling in our  
own hearts. There alone can we find it.   
If we understand the giving up of the world in its old, crude sense, then it  
would come to this: that we must not work, that we must be idle, sitting like  
lumps of earth, neither thinking nor doing anything, but must become  
fatalists, driven about by every circumstance, ordered about by the laws of  
nature, drifting from place to place. That would be the result. But that is  
not what is meant. We must work. Ordinary mankind, driven everywhere by false  
desire, what do they know of work? The man propelled by his own feelings and  
his own senses, what does he know about work? He works, who is not propelled  
by his own desires, by any selfishness whatsoever. He works, who has no  
ulterior motive in view. He works, who has nothing to gain from work.   
Who enjoys the picture, the seller or the seer? The seller is busy with his  
accounts, computing what his gain will be, how much profit he will realise on  
the picture. His brain is full of that. He is looking at the hammer, and  
watching the bids. He is intent on hearing how fast the bids are rising. That  
man is enjoying the picture who has gone there without any intention of buying  
or selling. He looks at the picture and enjoys it. So this whole universe is a  
picture, and when these desires have vanished, men will enjoy the world, and  
then this buying and selling and these foolish ideas of possession will be  
ended. The money-lender gone, the buyer gone, the seller gone, this world  
remains the picture, a beautiful painting. I never read of any more beautiful  
conception of God than the following: "He is the Great Poet, the Ancient Poet; the whole universe is His poem,  
coming in verses and rhymes and rhythms, written in infinite bliss."   
When we have given up desires, then alone shall we be able to read and enjoy  
this universe of God. Then everything will become deified. Nooks and corners,  
by-ways and shady places, which we thought dark and unholy, will be all  
deified. They will all reveal their true nature, and we shall smile at  
ourselves and think that all this weeping and crying has been but child's  
play._

_So work, says the Vedanta, putting God in everything, and knowing Him to be  
in everything. Work incessantly, holding life as something deified, as God  
Himself, and knowing that this is all we have to do, this is all we should ask  
for. God is in everything, where else shall we go to find Him? He is already  
in every work, in every thought, in every feeling. Thus knowing, we must work  
? this is the only way, there is no other. Thus the effects of work will not  
bind us. We have seen how false desires are the cause of all the misery and  
evil we suffer, but when they are thus deified, purified, through God, they  
bring no evil, they bring no misery. Those who have not learnt this secret  
will have to live in a demoniacal world until they discover it. Many do not  
know what an infinite mine of bliss is in them, around them, everywhere; they  
have not yet discovered it. What is a demoniacal world? The Vedanta says,  
ignorance.   
We are dying of thirst sitting on the banks of the mightiest river. We are  
dying of hunger sitting near heaps of food. Here is the blissful universe, yet  
we do not find it. We are in it all the time, and we are always mistaking it.  
Religion proposes to find this out for us. The longing for this blissful  
universe is in all hearts. It has been the search of all nations, it is the  
one goal of religion, and this ideal is expressed in various languages in  
different religions. It is only the difference of language that makes all  
these apparent divergences. One expresses a thought in one way, another a  
little differently, yet perhaps each is meaning exactly what the other is  
expressing in a different language.   
More questions arise in connection with this. It is very easy to talk. From my  
childhood I have heard of seeing God everywhere and in everything, and then I  
can really enjoy the world, but as soon as I mix with the world, and get a few  
blows from it, the idea vanishes. I am walking in the street thinking that God  
is in every man, and a strong man comes along and gives me a push and I fall  
flat on the footpath. Then I rise up quickly with clenched fist, the blood has  
rushed to my head, and the reflection goes. Immediately I have become mad.  
Everything is forgotten; instead of encountering God I see the devil. Ever  
since we were born we have been told to see God in all. Every religion teaches  
that - see God in everything and everywhere. Do you not remember in the New  
Testament how Christ says so? We have all been taught that; but it is when we  
come to the practical side, that the difficulty begins. You all remember how  
in ?esop's Fables a fine stag is looking at his form reflected in a lake and  
is saying to his young one, "How powerful I am, look at my splendid head, look  
at my limbs, how strong and muscular they are; and how swiftly I can run." In  
the meantime he hears the barking of dogs in the distance, and immediately  
takes to his heels, and after he has run several miles, he comes back panting.  
The young one says, "You just told me how strong you were, how was it that  
when the dog barked, you ran away?" "Yes, my son; but when the dogs bark all  
my confidence vanishes." Such is the case with us. We think highly of  
humanity, we feel ourselves strong and valiant, we make grand resolves; but  
when the "dogs" of trial and temptation bark, we are like the stag in the  
fable. Then, if such is the case, what is the use of teaching all these  
things? There is the greatest use. The use is this, that perseverance will  
finally conquer. Nothing can be done in a day.   
"This Self is first to be heard, then to be thought upon, and then meditated  
upon." Everyone can see the sky, even the very worm crawling upon the earth  
sees the blue sky, but how very far away it is! So it is with our ideal. It is  
far away, no doubt, but at the same time, we know that we must have it. We  
must even have the highest ideal. Unfortunately in this life, the vast  
majority of persons are groping through this dark life without any ideal at  
all. If a man with an ideal makes a thousand mistakes, I am sure that the man  
without an ideal makes fifty thousand. Therefore, it is better to have an  
ideal. And this ideal we must hear about as much as we can, till it enters  
into our hearts, into our brains, into our very veins, until it tingles in  
every drop of our blood and permeates every pore in our body. We must meditate  
upon it. "Out of the fullness of the heart the mouth speaketh," and out of the  
fullness of the heart the hand works too.   
It is thought which is the propelling force in us. Fill the mind with the  
highest thoughts, hear them day after day, think them month after month. Never  
mind failures; they are quite natural, they are the beauty of life, these  
failures. What would life be without them? It would not be worth having if it  
were not for struggles. Where would be the poetry of life? Never mind the  
struggles, the mistakes. I never heard a cow tell a lie, but it is only a cow  
- never a man. So never mind these failures, these little backslidings; hold  
the ideal a thousand times, and if you fail a thousand times, make the attempt  
once more. The ideal of man is to see God in everything. But if you cannot see  
Him in everything, see Him in one thing, in that thing which you like best,  
and then see Him in another. So on you can go. There is infinite life before  
the soul. Take your time and you will achieve your end.   
 **" He, the One, who vibrates more quickly than mind, who attains to more  
speed than mind can ever do, whom even the gods reach not, nor thought grasps,  
He moving, everything moves. In Him all exists. He is moving. He is also  
immovable. He is near and He is far. He is inside everything. He is outside  
everything, interpenetrating everything. Whoever sees in every being that same  
Atman, and whoever sees everything in that Atman, he never goes far from that  
Atman. When all life and the whole universe are seen in this Atman, then alone  
man has attained the secret. There is no more delusion for him. Where is any  
more misery for him who sees this Oneness in the universe?"**

Moons, galaxies and worlds drunk from this cup.   
And the cupbearer is nowhere to be seen!

**_The angels have bowed down to you and drowned   
The angels have bowed down to you and drowned   
Your soul in Being, past all plummet's sound --   
Do not despise yourself, for there is none   
Who could with you sustain comparison;   
Do not torment yourself -- your soul is All,   
Your body but a fleeting particle.   
This All will clarify, and in its light   
Each particle will shine, distinctly bright --   
As flesh remains an agent of the soul,   
You soul's an agent of the sacred Whole.   
But "part" and "whole" must disappear at last;   
The Way is one, and number is surpassed.   
A hundred thousand clouds above you press;   
Their rain is pure, unending happiness;   
And when the desert blooms with flowers, their scent   
And beauty minister to your content;   
The prayers of all the angels, all they do,   
All their obedience, God bestows on you.   
Farid ud-Din Attar

**_Love puts reason to silence.   
Love is a perfect muzzle of evil suggestions;   
Without love who ever succeeded in stopping them?   
Be a lover, and seek that fair Beauty,   
Hunt for that Waterfowl in every stream!   
How can you get water from that which cuts it off?   
How gain understanding from what destroys understanding?   
Apart from principles of reason are other principles   
Of light and great price to be gained by love of God.   
Besides this reason of yours God has other reasons   
Which will procure for you heavenly nourishment.   
By your carnal reason you may procure earthly food,   
By God-given reason you may mount the heavens.   
When, to win enduring love of God, you sacrifice reason,   
God gives you "a tenfold recompense;"   
 yea, seven hundred fold.   
Be lost, then, in God's beauty more than those women.   
Love of God cuts short reasoning, O beloved,   
For it is a present refuge from perplexities.   
Through love bewilderment befalls the power of speech,   
It no longer dares to utter what passes;   
For if it sets forth an answer, it fears greatly   
That its secret treasure may escape its lips.   
Therefore it closes lips from saying good or bad,   
So that its treasure may not escape it.   
In like manner the Prophet's companions tell us   
"When the Prophet used to tell us deep sayings,   
That chosen one, while scattering pearls of speech,   
Would bid us preserve perfect quiet and silence."   
So, when the mighty phoenix hovers over your head,   
Causing your soul to tremble at the motion of its wings,   
You venture not to stir from your place,   
Lest that bird of good fortune should take wing.   
You hold your breath and repress your coughs,   
So as not to scare that phoenix into flying away.   
And if one say a word to you, whether good or bad,   
You place finger on lip, as much as to say, "Be silent."   
That phoenix is bewilderment, it makes you silent;   
The kettle is silent, though it is boiling all the while.

**_Knowledge should mean a full grasp of knowledge   
Knowledge should mean a full grasp of knowledge: Knowledge means to know yourself, heart and soul.   
If you have failed to understand yourself,   
Then all of your reading has missed its call.   
What is the purpose of reading those books?   
So that Man can know the All-Powerful.   
If you have read, but failed to understand,   
Then your efforts are just a barren toil.   
Don?t boast of reading, mastering science   
Or of all your prayers and obeisance.   
If you don?t identify Man as God,   
All your learning is of no use at all.   
The true meaning of the four holy books   
Is found in the alphabet?s first letter.   
You talk about that first letter, preacher;   
What is the meaning of that - could you tell?   
Yunus Emre says to you, Pharisee,   
Make the holy pilgrimage if need be   
A hundred times - but if you ask me,   
A visit to the heart is best of all.

**Bhishma said,   
'O Krishna, O foremost of Beings, be thou pleased with these words which I  
utter,   
 in brief and in detail, from desire of hymning thy praises.  
**Thou art pure and purity 's self. Thou transcendest all.   
Thou art what people say to be THAT. Thou art the Supreme Lord.   
With my whole heart I seek thy refuge, O universal Soul and Lord of all  
creatures!   
Thou art without beginning and without end.   
Thou art the highest of the high and Brahman. Neither the gods nor the Rishis  
know thee.   
 The divine Creator, called Narayana or Hari, alone knows thee. T   
hrough Narayana, the Rishis, the Siddhas, the great Nagas, the gods,   
and the celestial Rishis know a little of thee.   
Thou art the highest of the high and knowest no deterioration.   
 The gods, the Danavas, the Gandharvas, the Yakshas, the Pannagas,   
do not know who thou art and whence art thou.   
All the worlds and all created things live in thee, and enter thee (when the  
dissolution comes).   
Like gems strung together in a thread, all things that have attributes reside  
in thee,   
the Supreme Lord.   
Having the universe for thy work and the universe for thy limbs,   
this universe consisting of mind and matter resides in thy eternal and all-  
pervading soul   
 like a number of flowers strung together in a strong thread.   
Thou art called Hari, of a thousand heads, a thousand feet, a thousand eyes,   
a thousand arms, a thousand crowns, and a thousand faces of great splendour.   
Thou art called Narayana, divinity, and the refuge of the universe.   
Thou art the subtlest of the subtle, grossest of the gross,   
 the heaviest of the heavy and the highest of the high.   
 In the Vaks, the Anuvaks, the Nishads, and Upanishads,   
thou art regarded as the Supreme Being of irresistible force.   
In the Samans also, whose declarations are always true, thou art regarded as  
Truth's self!   
Thou art of quadruple self.   
Thou art displayed in only the understanding (of all creatures).   
Thou art the Lord of those that are bound to thee in faith.   
O God, thou art adored (by the faithful) under four excellent, high, and  
secret names.   
Penances are ever present in thee. Performed (by other creatures for  
gratifying thee),   
penances live in thy form.   
Thou art the Universal Self. Thou art of universal knowledge.   
Thou art the universe. Thou art omniscient.   
Thou art the creator of everything in the universe.   
Like a couple of sticks generating a blazing fire,   
thou hast been born of the divine Devaki and Vasudeva for the protection of  
Brahma on earth.   
For this eternal salvation, the devout worshipper,   
 with mind withdrawn from everything else and casting off all desires,   
 beholds thee, O Govinda, that art the pure Self, in his own self.   
Thou transcendest Surya in glory.   
Thou art beyond the ken of the senses and the understanding.   
 O Lord of all creatures, I place myself in thy hands.'   
Part of Bhishma prayer to Lord Krishna

**_The sound of Krishna 's flute bewilders the hearts of the gopis.   
It makes their jewelled tiaras whirl and their elegant floral decorations  
fall.   
 It drives away the irrepressible suffering of the celestials.

The standard example of a Jnani also enjoying material riches (Ikaloka sukha)  
is Janaka.   
Sri Ramakrishna used to say that Janaka drinks milk from two cups! A Jnani  
does not care for   
ikaloka sukha but it sometimes comes out of its own accord by divine will.  
Such pleasures   
which came in his way, without asking, does not in any way belittle his state  
of Atma Jnana.   
Once a devotee who had seen Bhagavan Ramana in Virupakshi   
Cave eating only cold rice and lying on a stone-bench came to   
see Him again after 20 years. Now he saw Bhagavan Ramana   
sitting on a sofa with pillows and eating hot food served at stroke   
of the bell, with incense throwing up nice fragrance around His sofa   
all the time. Somehow, these 'scenes' did not satisfy the devotee.   
He came to Bhagavan and said: "Swami, You have been spoiled!"   
Bhagavan Ramana readily answered: "Yes, Yes, I have been spoiled!"   
The devotee was satisfied and he left the place.   
Others in the Old Hall, were murmuring as to why Bhagavan   
should say this. Bhagavan Ramana knew their minds and said: "What wrong did I do? In Virupaksha Cave as well as in Asramam   
now, "I' has been spoiled (beyond redemption). And that is all   
I meant." All the devotees laughed.   
Bhagavan Ramana has said to Annamalai Swami: The good benefits   
that are accruing to you without your desire-ship or doer-ship,   
you can enjoy since they do not create any further 'agami' sin   
for you.   
Arunachala Siva.

**ANNAMALAI SWAMI - ESSENTIALS**   
Don?t allocate periods of time to meditate ?I am? with closed eyes. Do it  
throughout the day while doing all other activities.   
If you want to go beyond the body and mind, abide in the ?I am? only and  
understand that all that is ?I am? plus is false.   
Abidance or meditation in the ?I am? is a process by which attention is kept  
focused on the substratum instead of the names and forms that are habitually  
imposed on it.   
When you abide in the ?I am? ignorance vanishes. Ignorance is not knowing the  
?I am? in its absolute purity.

**Truth need not hurt**   
An illumined love which never degenerates into attachment, A superior dignity  
untainted by the least trace of pride, a sublime wisdom which sheds light but  
not scorching heat - these elements characterize true greatness, a spontaneous  
synthesis of truth and love, of strength and grace.   
The truly great ones are whole and wholesome, not the victims of partial and  
mutually incompatible virtues so much apparent in lesser men. Their life as  
well as words reveal a fascinating harmony of rare qualities. Witness the  
struggles of the aspirant in whom one virtue can hardly co-exist with another;  
whose truth hurts, whose frankness is obviously 'brutal', whose sincerity is  
embarrassing, whose strength is withering, or whose sympathy and compassion  
only serve to encourage weaknesses.   
It needs a perfected soul to harmonize strength and grace even under the most  
delicate and provocative of circumstances; and precisely one such was the  
Buddha, the Blessed One.   
On one occasion his dear and remarkable disciple, Sariputra, approached the  
Guru in an exalted mood of adoration. After saluting reverently he took his  
seat by the Master's side and burst into a high eulogy: "Lord! There is none  
greater than you, the Blessed One; there never has been any, there never will  
be, and none other exists now - greater or wiser. That is what I think; that  
is my faith."   
The Blessed One was free to accept this praise and adoration, coming as it did  
from a sincere heart; free to approve of it and bask in its welcome warmth -  
the way many lesser teachers are often tempted to do.   
Or like certain stern 'impersonalists' he could have over-reacted, coming  
down heavily on the disciple and reduced him to pulp with stinging words and  
ridicule-' None of the personality cult!'   
One way he could have inflated his own ego; the other way he could have broken  
and crushed that of the disciple. He did something infinitely better; made  
both shine out better.   
Gently and calmly, he just put a counter-question: "Is that so Sariputra?  
Grand and bold indeed is your assertion. That means you have obviously known  
all the Blessed Ones of the whole past, and that thoroughly?"   
Honest that he was, Sariputra would not try to defend his position  
emotionally. Plain was his answer. "How can I say that, Lord? I can't."   
A little pause, and the Buddha again inquired: "Then you must surely have  
known all the Blessed Ones yet to come, and that perfectly?"   
Sariputra might have felt embarrassed but that did not come in the way of his  
truthfulness. So he replied: "Not so, O Lord! I have not."   
A little more pause and the Blessed One asked: "But then, at least you know me  
as the holy Buddha now alive, and you have penetrated my mind fully and  
completely?"   
Sariputra could only say, "No Lord! Not that even."   
The very nature of the question-answer process was enough to awaken the needed  
perspective in Sariputra's mind. That done, the Buddha clinched the issue  
saying, " _You see then, Sariputra! You know not the hearts of the Buddhas of  
the past nor the future- nor even of myself. How then can you make such a  
grand and bold statement?_ "   
Sariputra admitted that his statement was not based on knowledge of facts but  
on his own deep faith, and tried to explain himself.   
 _" Great is your faith, Sariputra,_" declared the Blessed One appreciatively,  
yet at the same time adding the warning, _" but take heed that it is well-  
grounded."_   
The superior teacher, the right kind of Guru he was, the Buddha would not  
destroy the disciple's faith nor allow it to run in wrong channels. He would  
not allow the other great ones to be belittled; but neither would he  
unnecessarily belittle himself, nor would he make the disciple feel small.   
All concerned would be borne aloft by the uplifting breeze of gentle wisdom.   
So it is no wonder that he declared on another occasion, "Those that take  
refuge in me with faith and devotion will get Svarga, paradise. Those who,  
with full faith, will follow my Dharma (the path of Truth) will become Buddhas  
like me."

Nagaraj/Sadhak/Friends,   
There is this fundamental difference between 'admiration' and  
'adoration'....Admiration is an exultation of the mind that admits differences  
so as to put the 'object of admiration' above all other  
objects........Adoration is a thing of the heart which dissolves the 'subject'  
and sees no object........it does not see any differences.Adoration thus sees  
the beloved in everything........it beholds the unity in diversity.   
In many Hymns of saints......there is the oft repeated phrase..... _ந ாயினும்  
கடையேன்_(worse than a cur)..................Why do the saints use this phrase?  
...........Why do they not say 'worse than a pig' or anything of that  
sort?....................Why say 'நாயினும் கடையேன்'?....................It is  
not to demean any animal be it a dog or a pig or whatever.............The  
phrase is used to say that a dog can scent it's master irrespective of  
whatever guise he may come in.............. _The dog is simply not fooled by  
the appearance of its master_........................and traces and recognizes  
the master by his 'scent'.............................so..........'நாயினும்  
கடையேன்' means that one is worse than a dog- in that one is not in a position  
to recognize God although there is nothing other than god in all that one sees  
,hears,touches........................The Great ones pray that they be  
vouchsafed the ability of the 'dog'. ..........the manner in which it is able  
to sniff the scent..........this is devotion.Without this ability,all efforts  
are futile...........when this scent is smelt.......there is adoration sans  
admiration.   
In akshara maNa mAlai, verse 39 Sri Bhagavan wonderfully says: _ஞ மலியிற் கேடா  
நானென் னுறுதியா னாடிநின் னுறுவே னருணாசலா._   
Instead of saying that he is 'worse than a dog'. ......he questions 'Am I  
worse than a Dog?'...............He says:"Am I worse than a Dog?.......I shall  
firmly and steadfastly seek the 'i'(like the dog traces the scent of its  
master) and attain Thee,O Arunachala!"   
Namaskar

**Buddhist Quote**   
?The Buddha is not going to project you to Buddhahood, as if throwing a stone.  
He is not going to purify you, as if washing a dirty cloth, nor is he going to  
cure you of ignorance, like a doctor administering medicine to a passive  
patient.   
Having attained full enlightenment himself, he is showing you the path, and it  
is up to you to follow it or not. It is up to you now to practice these  
teachings and experience their results.?

A Saint, if he is truly a Brahmajnani does not commit any sin. And he is  
above sin and merits.   
In stories, we see only a sinner becoming a saint, as in the cases of Valmiki  
and Arunagiri Natha.   
A saint becoming a sinner is almost nil. There may be a couple of cases, like  
Sage Viswamitra   
who got enamoured with Menaka, and started a life of conjugal bliss. Even  
here, it is not a sin   
but an error, and it caused only a reversal of the merits of his penance. He  
had to start the penance   
all over again when he realized his error.   
Bhagavan Ramana has said: If someone causes misery for a Jnani, he takes over  
the sins/errors   
if any of the Jnani and Jnani becomes a clean slate. If on the other hand if  
a devotee causes happiness   
for a Jnani, like giving food, medicines etc., then such a devotee takes over  
the merits of a Jnani.   
Because a Jnani does not need any merits for him.   
Arunachala Siva

Advaita Bodha Deepika: continues....   
Disciple: How?   
Master: As soon as the power lying dormant shows forth as mind, the latencies  
of the mind sprout forth, and grow up   
like trees which together form the universe. The mind sports with its  
latencies. They rise up as thoughts and materialize   
as the universe, which is thus only a dream vision. The Jivas and Isvara  
being its contents are as illusory as this day dream.   
Disciple: Please explain their illusory character.   
Master: The world is an object and seen as the result of the sport of mind.  
The Jivas and Isvara are contained in it. Parts   
can be only as real as the whole. Suppose the universe is painted in colors  
on a wall. The Jivas and Isvara will be figures   
in the painting. The figure can be only as real as the painting itself.   
Here the universe is itself a product of the mind and Isvara and the Jivas  
form parts of the same product. Therefore, they   
must be only mental projections and nothing more. This is clear from the  
Sruti which says that Maya gave rise to the   
illusions of Isvara and the Jivas, and from the Vasishta Smrti where Vasishta  
says that as if by magic the latencies dance   
about in mind as, he_I-you-this-that my son - property etc.,

Advaita Bodha Deepika: Devotee: Where does this smriti speak of Isvara, Jiva and Jagat?   
Master: In its statement Sohamidam, i.e He-I-this, 'He means the unseen  
Isvara. 'I' means the Jiva parading as the ego,   
the doer etc.; 'this' means all the objective universe. From the scriptures,  
reasoning and experience, sruti yukti and anubhava,   
it is clear that the Jiva, Isvara and Jagat are only mental projections.   
Devotee: How do reasoning, and experience support this view?   
Master: With the rise of mind in waking and dream, the latencies come into  
play, and the Jiva,Isvara and Jagat   
appear. With the subsidence of the latencies in deep sleep, swoon etc., they  
all disappear. This is within the experience   
of every one.,   
Again when all the latencies are rooted out by knowledge, the Jivas, Isvara,  
and the Jagat disappear once for all.   
This is within the experience of perfectly clear sighted great sages  
established in the non dual Reality, beyond the Jivas,   
Isvara, and Jagat. Therefore we say that these are all projections of the  
mind. Thus is explained the effect of Maya.

Advaita Bodha Deepika: Disciple: What is the limit of Maya?   
Master: It is the knowledge resulting from an inquiry into the sense of the  
Mahavakya. Because Maya is Ignorance, and   
Ignorance subsists on non inquiry. When non inquiry gives place to inquiry,  
right knowledge results and puts an end to   
Ignorance that is Maya.

Advaita Bodha Deepika: Now listen. Ailments in the body are the results of past karma; they subsist  
on wrong diet and increase with its continuation.   
Or, the ignorance of rope, so long as it is not inquired into, projects a  
snake into view and other hallucinations follow in its   
wake. In the same manner, although Maya is self-evident, beginningless and  
spontaneous, yet it subsists in the absence   
of inquiry into the nature of the Self, manifests the universe etc., and grows  
more massive.   
With the rise of inquiry, Maya hitherto grown strong by its absence, loses its  
nourishment and gradually withers away with   
all its effects, namely the Jagat etc., Just as in the absence of inquiry, the  
ignorance factor of rope made it look a snake but   
suddenly disappeared with the rise of inquiry, so also Maya flourishes in  
ignorance and disappears with the rise of inquiry.

Advaita Bodha Deepika: Just as the rope and snake and the power which produces this illusion persist  
before inquiry, but after inquiry end in simple rope,   
so also Maya and its effects, the Jagat, persist before inquiry but end in  
pure Brahman afterwards.   
Disciple: How can a single thing appear in two different ways?   
Master: Brahman, non dual, Pure Being, presents itself as the Jagat before  
inquiry, and shows itself in its True form after inquiry.   
 See how before proper consideration clay appears a pot and afterwards as clay  
only; or gold appears as ornaments and then   
is found to be only gold. Similarly with Brahman too. After inquiry Brahman  
is realized to be unitary, non dual, impartite,   
and unchanged in the past present and future. In It there is nothing like  
Maya, or its effect, such as the Jagat. This   
realization is known as the Supreme Knowledge and the limit of Ignorance.  
Thus is described the 'limit' of Maya.   
Disciple: What is the 'fruit' of Maya?   
Master: That is fruitlessly vanishes into nothing, is its fruit. A hare's horn  
is mere sound having no significance. So it is with   
Maya, mere sound without any meaning. Realized sages have found it so.   
Disciple: Then why do not all agree on this point?   
Master: The ignorant believe it to be real. Those who are thoughtful will say  
it is indescribable. Realized Sages say that it   
is non existent like the hare's horn. It thus appears in these three ways.  
People will speak of it from their own points of view.   
Disciple: How can Maya be compared to a mother burnt down to ashes by her  
daughter?   
Master: In the process of inquiry, Maya becomes more and more transparent and  
turns into Knowledge. Knowledge is thus   
born of Maya, and is therefore said to be the daughter of Maya. Maya so long  
flourishing on non inquiry comes to its last   
days, on inquiry. Just as a crab brings forth its young only to die itself,  
so also in the last days of inquiry Maya brings forth   
Knowledge for its own undoing. Immediately the daughter, Knowledge, burns  
down her to ashes.

Advaita Bodha Deepika: continues....   
Disciple: How can the progeny kill the parent?   
Master: In a bamboo forest, the bamboos move in the wind, rub against one  
another and produce fire which burns down   
the parent trees. So also Knowledge born of Maya burns Maya to ashes. Maya  
remains only in name like a hare's horn.   
Therefore the sages declare it non existent. Moreover, the very name implies  
its unreality. The names are Avidya and Maya.   
Of these the former means 'Ignorance or that which is not. ; again 'Maya is  
that which is not'. yaa maa saa maayaa. Therefore   
it is simple negation. Thus that it fruitlessly vanishes into nothing is its  
fruit.   
Disciple: Master, Maya turns into Knowledge. Therefore it cannot be said to  
vanish fruitlessly as nothing.   
Master: Only if the Knowledge, the modified Maya, be real, Maya can be said to  
be real. But this Knowledge itself is false.   
Therefore, Maya is false.   
Disciple: How is Knowledge said to be false?   
Master: The fire in the friction of the trees burns them down and then dies  
out; the clearing nut carries down the impurities   
of water and itself settles down with them. Similarly this Knowledge destroys  
Ignorance and itself perishes. Since it is also   
finally resolved, the fruit of Maya can be only unreal.

Pollachi Dr. N. Mahalingam - Founder and Chairman of Sakthi Group of  
Companies, Coimbatore.   
Dr. Mahalingam was born on 21st March 1923. He passed away on 2nd October  
2014. More than an industrialist   
he was known for his expertise in teachings and philosophy of VaLLalaar  
Ramalinga Swamigal. He was also running   
a magazine called Sakthi. He had sponsored printing and publishing of many  
books, Canons of VaLLalaar (called six tirumurais) and   
also the work of Tirumoolar called Tirumandiram. He was a vegetarian  
throughout his life as recommended by VaLLalaar.   
atmavichar of our Forum has read the life and books of VaLLalaar and I am sure  
he is going to post some salient features   
of VaLLalaar Ramalinga Swamigal. Swamigal's famous quote is Arut Perum  
Jyothi, Thanip peRum karunai. Arut Perum   
Jyothi, Thanip Perum KaruNai.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Surbramaniam Sir   
Thanks for writing about the demise of Arutselvar Sri N Mahalingam. A great  
noble soul who inspite of being a great Industrialist was always simple and  
very spiritual at heart. Though he respected all saints, he was very keen on  
2 great saints - one Ramalinga Swamigal and second Mahatma Gandhi and he  
published the complete works of both these saints in subsidized forms. One of  
my keen interest on Saint Ramalinga Swamigal was due to reading articles of  
Vallalar and Arutpa in his spiritual magazine Sakthi. Sri N Mahalingam used  
to conduct Gandhi Vallar Festival every year for 10 days starting /concluding  
on 2nd October. No wonder Sri N Mahalingam passed away on 2nd October on  
Gandhi Jayanthi day while participating in the Gandhi Vallar function. What  
else proof you need to know that the divinity that you are foucssedd day in  
and out in your heart will absorb you at the most auspicious day /time at the  
time of death. In recent times we saw how Smt Kanakammal merged with Bhagavan  
Ramana on 1 Jan 2010 on his Jayanti day at the Ashram.

Advaita Bodha Deepika: continues...   
Disciple: Should Knowledge also vanish in the end, how can samsara, the  
effects of Ignorance, be eradicated?   
Master: Samsara, the effect of Ignorance, is unreal, like Knowledge. One  
unreality can be undone by another unreality.   
Disciple: How can it be done?   
Master: A dream subject's hunger is satisfied by dream food. The one is  
unreal as the other and yet serves the purpose.   
Similarly, though Knowledge is unreal, yet it serves the purpose. Bondage and  
Release are only false ideas of Ignorance.   
As the appearance and disappearance of rope snake are equally false, so are  
also bondage and release in Brahman.   
To conclude, the Supreme Truth is only the non dual Brahman. All else is false  
and does not exist at any time.   
The Sruti supports it saying, "Nothing is created or destroyed; there is no  
bondage or deliverance; no one is bound;   
or desirous of release. There is no aspirant, no practiser and no one  
liberated. This is the Supreme Truth."   
Removal of superimposition thus consists in knowledge of non dual Brahman,  
Pure Being, beyond Maya and its effects.   
Its realization is Liberation while in the body - Jivan Mukti.   
Only a careful student of this chapter can be desirous of knowing the process  
of inquiry into the Self as a means of undoing   
the superimposition of ignorance. The seeker fit for such inquiry must  
possess the fourfold qualities which will be dealt with   
next.   
A competent seeker must carefully study these two chapters before proceeding  
further.   
Chapter II - Aropa - concluded.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.

Friends,   
I have found some of Sadhu Om's comments dogmatic and do not reflect the whole  
Truth,particularly his saying on Sri Ramakrishna.In fact Sri Ramakrishna has  
said the very opposite of what sadhu Om has claimed that he said!   
Quote  
> _Someone whose mind is thus attached to any name or form will not be able  
> to understand even intellectually what self attention actually is._ **Even  
> if he can enjoy the company of the name and form of his beloved God, how  
> does that help him?** **Ramakrishna said that even if God wants to take us  
> to the self, he cannot unless we want him to**. Only by our own liking  
> and effort to practice self attention can we attain self attention and true  
> self knowledge (atma jnana)  
Here is an excerpt from The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna: 1\. 'I am He', 'I am the Pure Self'-that is the conclusion of the jnanis. But  
the bhaktas say,'The whole universe is the glory of God.' Who would recognize  
a wealthy man without his power and riches? But _it is quite different when  
God Himself, gratified by the aspirant 's devotion, says to him, 'You are the  
same as Myself.' Suppose a king is seated in his court, and his cook enters  
the hall, sits on the throne, and says, 'O King, you and I are the same!'  
People will certainly call him a madman. But suppose one day the king, pleased  
with the cook's service, says to him: 'Come, sit beside me. There is nothing  
wrong in that. There is no difference between you and me.' Then, if the cook  
sits on the throne with the king, there is no harm in it_. It is not good for  
ordinary people to say, 'I am He'. The waves belong to the water. Does the  
water belong to the waves?   
 **Result of yoga through bhakti**   
" _The upshot of the whole thing is that, no matter what path you follow, yoga  
is impossible unless the mind becomes quiet. The mind of a yogi is under his  
control; he is not under the control of his mind. When the mind is quiet the  
prana stops functioning. Then one gets kumbhaka. One may have the same  
kumbhaka through bhaktiyoga as well; the prana stops functioning through love  
of God too. In the kirtan the musician sings, 'Nitai amar mata hati!'  
Repeating this, he goes into a spiritual mood and cannot sing the whole  
sentence. He simply sings, 'Hati! Hati' When the mood deepens he sings only,  
'Ha! Ha!' Thus his prana stops through ecstasy, and kumbhaka follows_.   
2. **Attitude of jnanis and bhaktas**   
" _He who is called Brahman by the jnanis is known as Atman by the yogis and  
as Bhagavan by the bhaktas. The same brahmin is called priest, when  
worshipping in the temple, and   
cook, when preparing a meal in the kitchen._ The jnani sticking to the path of  
knowledge, always reasons about the Reality, saying, 'Not this, not this'.  
Brahman is neither 'this' nor 'that'; It is neither the universe nor its  
living beings. Reasoning in this way, the mind becomes steady. Then it  
disappears and the aspirant goes into samadhi. This is the knowledge of  
Brahman. It is the unwavering conviction of the jnani that Brahman alone is  
real and the world illusory. All these names and forms are illusory, like a  
dream. What Brahman is cannot be described. One cannot even say that Brahman  
is a Person. This is the opinion of the jnanis, the followers of Vedanta  
philosophy.   
"But the bhaktas accept all the states of consciousness. They take the waking  
state to be real also. They don't think the world to be illusory, like a  
dream. They say that the universe is a manifestation of God's power and glory.  
God has created all these - sky, stars, moon, sun, mountains, ocean, men,  
animals. They constitute His glory. He is within us, in our hearts.   
Again, He is outside. The most advanced devotees say that He Himself has  
become all this - the twenty-four cosmic principles, the universe, and all  
living beings. The devotee of God wants to eat sugar, not to become sugar.  
(All laugh.)   
"Do you know how a lover of God feels? His attitude is: 'O God, Thou are the  
Master, and I am Thy servant. Thou art the Mother, and I am Thy child.' Or  
again: 'Thou art my Father   
and Mother. Thou art the Whole, and I am a part.' He doesn't like to say, 'I  
am Brahman.'   
 **Attitude of yogis**   
"The yogi seeks to realize the Paramatman, the Supreme Soul. His ideal is the  
union of the embodied soul and the Supreme Soul. He withdraws his mind from  
sense-objects and tries   
to concentrate it on the Paramatman. Therefore, during the first stage of his  
spiritual discipline, he retires into solitude and with undivided attention  
practises meditation in a   
fixed posture.   
" _But the Reality is one and the same. The difference is only in name. He who  
is Brahman is verily Atman, and again, He is the Bhagavan. He is Brahman to  
the followers of the path of   
knowledge, Paramatman to the yogis, and Bhagavan to the lovers of God._"   
\   
Time and again Sri Ramakrishna has emphasized the efficay of dualistic form of  
worship -how that spontaneously leads to the quietening and absorption of the  
mind into God or Source or Brahman or paramatman.All great sages have likewise  
affirmed this fundamental truth and we may also affirm the same through our  
practice as well.   
Namaskar.

Friends,   
Here is another excerpt from The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna: (To M.) "That is why I have been telling you not to reason any more. I came  
from the pine grove to say that to you. Through too much reasoning your  
spiritual life will be injured; you will at last become like Hazra. I used to  
roam at night in the streets, all alone, and cry to the Divine Mother, 'O  
Mother, blight with Thy thunderbolt my desire to reason!' Tell me that you  
won't reason any more."   
M: "Yes, sir. I won't reason any more."   
MASTER: "Everything can be achieved through bhakti alone. _Those who want the  
Knowledge of Brahman will certainly achieve that also by following the trail  
of bhakti. "Can a man blessed with the grace of God ever lack Knowledge? At  
Kamarpukur I have seen grain-dealers measuring paddy. As one heap is measured  
away another heap is pushed forward to be measured. The Mother supplies the  
devotees with the 'heap' of Knowledge_.   
.................   
 _The bhakta wants to realize the Personal God endowed with form and talk to  
Him. He seldom seeks the Knowledge of Brahman. But God, who does everything at  
His pleasure, can make His devotee the heir to His infinite glories if it  
pleases Him. He gives His devotee both the Love of God and the Knowledge of  
Brahman. If one is able somehow to reach Calcutta, one can see the Maidan and  
the museum and other places too. The thing is how to reach Calcutta_.   
 _By realizing the Divine Mother of the Universe, you will get Knowledge as  
well as Devotion. You will get both. In bhava samadhi you will see the form of  
God, and in nirvikalpa samadhi you will realize Brahman, the Absolute  
Existence-Knowledge-Bliss. In nirvikalpa samadhi ego, name, and form do not  
exist_.   
The Gospel abounds in such passages as above.   
Namaskar.

Advaita Bodha Deepika: Sadhana: To the question 'How can there be samsara for the Supreme Self of Being  
Knowledge Bliss?' the sages answer,   
'When unmanifest, the power of Self is called Maya, and when when manifest,  
the same is mind. This mode of   
Maya, the inscrutable mind, is the sprout of samsara for the self.

Advaita Bodha Deepika: Sadhana: continues....   
Disciple: Who has said that the mind is indescribable.   
Master: Vasishta has said to Rama. In the non dual Consciousness, the bhava  
which, different from knowledge that is real,   
and different from insentience that is unreal, tending to create, project the  
latencies as this thing and that thing, mixes   
together the conscious and unconscious and makes them appear under categories  
'the sentient' and 'the insentient',   
itself of the nature of both sentient and insentient; always vacillating and  
changeful is mind. Therefore, it is indescribable.   
Though itself unchanging, the Supreme Self associated with the wrongly  
superimposed mind, appears to be changeful.   
Disciple: How is that?   
Master: Juste as a Brahmin, who is drunk, behaves strangely when in the power  
of liquors, so too the Self though   
unchanged by nature, associated now with the mind, appears changed as the Jiva  
wallowing in this samsara. Hence, the   
Self's samsara is not other than mind. The Srutis say so.   
Mind being the samsara, must be investigated. Associated with mind which  
according to its modes assumes the shapes of   
objects, the man seems to undergo the same changes. This eternal secret is  
disclosed in the Maitryiniya Upanishad. This   
also is confirmed by our experience and by positive and negative induction.

Advaita Bodha Deepika: Sadhana: continues.....   
Disciple: How is it confirmed by our experience?   
Master: When in deep sleep, the mind lies quiescent, the Self remains without  
change and without samsara. When in dream   
and waking, the mind manifests, the Self seems changed and caught up in the  
samsara. Everyone knows it by experience   
It is evident from Sruti, Smriti, logic, and experience that this samsara is  
nothing but mind itself. How can anyone dispute   
this point which is so obvious?   
Devotee: How does association with the mind entangle the Self in samsara?   
Master: Mind whose nature is always to be thinking of this and that, functions  
in the two modes -- the 'I' mode and 'this' mode,   
as already mentioned in Chapter I on Superimposition. Of these two, the  
I-mode has always the single concept 'I', whereas   
this mode varies according to t he quality operating at the time, Sattva,  
Rajas, or Tamas i.e. clearness, activity or dullness.   
Disciple: Who has said so before?   
Master: Sri Vidyaranyaswami has said that the mind has these qualities,  
Sattva, Rajas and Tamas and changes accordingly.   
In Sattva, dispassion, peace, beneficence, etc., manifest. In Rajas, desire,  
anger, greed, fear, efforts, etc., manifest.   
In Tamas, sloth confusion, dullness etc.

Unchanged Pure Knowledge by nature, the Supreme Self when associated with the

operative qualities, becomes identified with it.   
Disciple: How can that be?   
Master: You see how water is of itself cold and tasteless. Yet by  
association, it can be hot, sweet, bitter, sour etc., Similarly,   
the Self, by nature Being Knowledge Bliss, when associated with the I-mode,  
appears as the ego. Just as cold water in union   
with heat becomes hot, so also the Blissful Self in union with the 'I'-mode  
becomes the misery laden ego. Just as water,   
originally tasteless, becomes sweet or sour according to its associations, so  
also the Self of Pure Knowledge appears   
dispassionate, peaceful, beneficent, or passionate, angry, greedy, or dull and  
indolent, according to the quality of this-mode

The Sruti says that the Self associated with prana, etc., appears respectively  
as prana, anger, dispassion, etc.,

the misery of endless samsara, being deluded

Disciple: Now that samsara has fallen to the lot of the Self, how can it be

even in millions of eons (Kalpakoti Kala)   
Disciple: Cannot samsara be got rid of by any means other than making the mind  
still?   
Master: Absolutely by no other means; neither the Vedas, nor the sastras, nor  
austerities, nor karma, nor vows, nor gifts   
nor by recital of scriptures of mystic formulas (mantras), nor worship, nor  
anything else, can undo the samsara. Only

Yes,There is no point in talking about Advaita.The Advaita anubhuti is  
something that has to happen;it cannot be a result of any striving, although  
striving is needed.All striving is only to allow the working of the Yoga  
shakti or Grace to do the work.We need to cooperate by our receptivity and  
trust.   
The Right attitude that a seeker should have is not to be bothered about  
'advaita' or any other 'ultimate' grandiose goal.Just be like the person who  
did not make his choice in the 'Dyer and his tub' parable of Sri  
Ramakrishna.Here it is:  **" A certain man had a tub. People would come to him to have their clothes  
dyed. The tub   
contained a solution of dye. Whatever colour a man wanted for his cloth, he  
would get by   
dipping the cloth in the tub. One man was amazed to see this and said to the  
dyer,  
'Please   
give me the dye you have in your tub**.' "**   
What is it that one gains through satsangha?The Master says: Quote  
> **" What are the spiritual disciplines that give the mind its upward  
> direction? One learns all   
> this by constantly living in holy company.**  
Ultimately it is smarana.As Saint thyAgaraja sang-'smarane sukamu rama  
namam'.This is all that is needed if one develops a taste for it.   
In The Gospel,one of the most inspirational passage, to me,is this: Quote  
> **If you meditate on an ideal you will acquire its nature. If you think of  
> God day and night,   
> you will acquire the nature of God. A salt doll went into the ocean to

The spirit was surely not like "trying to know more than Sri Ramanujacharya"  
or just any body else... I was trying to observe that we are getting lost in  
"Tatvas" unconsciously, we somehow refuse to move on, and stay put with  
tatvas. We all would have experienced it, most times, after some heavy  
discussions on Tatvas, no matter how great it may be, when we becomre fatigued  
out, even sleeping for some time, would bestow such peace, just shutting down  
the computer and being, would give such immense peace. truth itself was  
spoiling Truth. Knwoledge is bigger ignorance than ignorance itself.   
It is not even about achievements, that i was observing about. It is the real  
paradox that i have observed, that has landed in a state of complete "not  
knowing"   
Like what Socratus has said "All that i know is the fact of my not knowing"   
How insignificant we are, in the scheme of things, how insignificant we are  
before the "tatvas"   
Ultimatley, i truly believe it is peace alone that matters, even more than any  
scriptures, terms of truth, we have to be at peace with what ever is. What  
ever is, is, as it is. We have nothing to do with it.   
_The awful daring of a moment 's surrender   
Which an age of prudence can never retract   
By this, and this only, we have existed.   
(T S Eliiot)

Shanti Shanti Shanti

At some point, i see, perhaps discern, we have to even give up Our Guru with  
his teachings, and, just accept Him, without any baggage, plain, simple, as a  
perfect layman. He is our Guru, who takes away everything, even all  
knowledge...   
I have observed, even seeing our Gurus as somebody of great knowledge, all  
knowing, great Brahma Jnani, Brahma Nishta etc... is in some ways problematic.   
After knowing our Gurus, i guess, at some point when we are really, at peace,  
we should give away all our books and remain. Noo Tatvas, No Siddhantas, no  
nothing, No this, No that, just   
Knowledge is great bondage...   
theLivu guruvin thirumEni kANDal   
theLivu guruvin thirunAmam ceppal   
theLivu guruvin thiruvArththai kETTal   
theLivu guruvuru cinthiththal thAnE.   
Clarity is seeing the holy Body of guru;   
Clarity is saying the holy Name of guru;   
Clarity is listening to the holy Words of guru;   
Clarity is contemplating on the holy Form of guru.   
Do we need anything more? really? But this makes so much sense only after  
realising the futility of all knowledge.   
Like Chinmayananda says somewhere, one can only renounce only after one has  
earned millions... (not exact phrase) Before that what one has to renounce...   
Knowledge is worst than even ignorance... ignorance reveals itself instantly,  
but this knowledge-ignorance, hides iself as perfect knowledge...dangerous  
fellow is this knowledge-ignorance

Sri Ravi,   
Are we ready yet, to accept that there is really nothing to do? the truth is  
so ordinary, that we are unable to accept the ordinary-ness of what is.   
We want something more... we just are not content, "is that all, there should  
be something more to this" goes unconsciously...   
_" One goes through all sorts of austerities to become what one already  
is." _** \- Bhagavan   
Funny, as we don't want to accept this, until we travel, we do all those  
austerities, all those struggles, all those mental masturbation, all those  
games of knowledge and ignorance, etc...

I do not subscribe to this view,because these are thoughts!We only need to  
reckon the immensity of this 'Ordinariness' which made the Upanishadic seer  
exclaim-'Vedahamehtam purusham mahantam,Aditya varnam Tamasah parastat'.Simply  
speaking,The Infinte is beyond the realms of 'Ordinary' and 'Extraordinary'.   
Quote  
> Quote

>> **" One goes through all sorts of austerities to become what one already

This has to be understood,not as a thought but experientially.It is not as if  
one came Back to where he started from.   
Quote

Precisely.Here Tirumular is trying to point to what Clarity is.It is not  
clarity as we imagine clarity to be- _' that the truth is so ordinary, that we  
are unable to accept the ordinary-ness of what is'_!'   
Quote  
> **Knowledge is worst than even ignorance... ignorance reveals itself

> knowledge...dangerous fellow is this knowledge-ignorance**  
I have also been emphasizing the same.We may have seen the crow fluttering its  
wings rapidly to gain height and then perform a Glide(with its wings  
spread).It lands on a tree top in the smug belief that it has done a sortie of  
an Eagle.Little does it know that that the Eagle is gliding at will at a great  
Height **,borne upward by buoyancy of the wind on its wings**.Most aspirants  
imagine that they are in the 'Just be' state or 'There is nothing to be  
done',etc.I have seen learned Swamijis caught in this belief.This belief is  
propagated as 'Yajnya'.   
I agree with you that Guru is a Tatva and personality cults are dangerous and  
detrimental.Devotion to the Guru is onething and admiration and attachment to  
the Guru is another.   
Namaskar.

Dear Sri Ravi,   
Do we realise, that the problem begins, this: Quote  
> Simply speaking,The Infinte is beyond the realms of 'Ordinary' and  
> 'Extraordinary'.   
>  
at putting the truth elsewhere, terming it as something, beyond ordinary and  
extra ordinary? We are in timeless search of this infinite.   
This "beyond" thing is only the true real Maya. There is no beyond, nothing  
beyond, than what is now, here. This only is **" Vasthvam"**   
Truth, happiness, everything is here, is its pristinity, only the demand for  
want of a higher better truth is the real problem.   
I do not intend to term it as 'ordinary' but it is just done so to lay stress  
on the fact of the truth, not being something more than what is, here, as it  
is, and not something better than what currently is.   
It discerns that the demand to search supercedes than the truth itself.

All these talks are only because non of us want to surrender and inquire to  
one's Being. To some of you this may sound funny but it is true. I really hope  
all of you to understand me right. I don't judge or anything. I am just trying  
to help you sharing my thoughts (which of course may be wrong).   
What I have in mind is that no matter what words or theories we share we are  
ignorant. The Knowledge all Saints are talking about, the so called jnana  
(Hindu), gnosis (Christians) or daat (Kabbalists) is to know our Self. If you  
do it no more questions will arise. All is the Self, all is God. There is no  
duality. In Guru Vachaka Kovai is stated: Quote  
> 47\. This world which appears, concealing Self, is a mere dream, but when  
> concealed by Self, it remains as none other than Self.   
>   
> 48\. This whole world of triads which deludes us, seeming to be an

> the statement, The world is Real.  
The experience of the bhakta is the same as the experience of the jnani but  
they call it sometime in different way. Those who say that all is God do not  
contradict with jnanis who say that there is only the Self. Can you see? All  
our discussion is based on whether the world is real and according to the  
answer of this question - how to behave. None of us can understand the real  
jnani and the real bhakta. The Supreme Lord in the Form of Lord Krishna says  
in Bhagavad Gita that Jnana yoga and Bhakti yoga lead to the same. If you  
don't believe in the Saints' words, believe in the Lord's.   
The knowledge mentioned here is not intellectual but experiential. Non of us  
would have this knowledge if we are looking for it by the intellect.   
As I said in the beginning the cause for all these conversations is our  
reslessness, of our mind bouncing here and there and not wanting to be drawn  
to the Source. It is like a man who have a toothache and fear of dentists and  
every day he says "I will go to the dentists later or tomorrow".   
One of the cause for the lack of surrender is too little faith. Not to mention  
that many following jnana say that God or Guru is unreal. How one to surrender  
to a Person who he/she subconsciously consider unreal. In my opinion many  
choose jnana marga because of their fat ego because jnana teach "You are the  
Supreme" and ego only waits to hear that but not realizing that jnanis don't  
talk about it (the ego) but about the Atman.   
Most of us more talk about Self-inqiury than practice it (I don't talk about  
you but generally). That again is because of the ego. It gets fatter because  
it considers itself that it knows the supreme path (jnana yoga) and the  
supreme method (Self-inquiry) by the Supreme Guru (Guru Ramana). It's getting  
fatter and fatter and fatter. But in reality we are falling down. We are just  
talking and do nothing. Even some "jnanis" justify their inactivity by saying  
"there is nothing to be done". This is wrong.   
Analyze yourself, analyze where are you now. Stop saying "I am the Self. I am  
always realized". No, you are not.   
Best wishes, ramana1359

Yes,friend.This is a sign that the mind free from distractions is _loving what  
it is doing_.   
Here are a few excerpts from the Gospel of sri Ramakrishna that shows what it  
means to 'Just be',to be in the state of jnana: Quote

The test of jnana is not whether 'I' is there or not.It is the absence of  
identification with the body.This is what Sri Bhagavan went through when he  
was in the patala linga when his body was eaten by insects and worms.It is  
what happened to sri Ramakrishna when he spent 6 months in the Nirvikalpa  
Samadhi, totally unaware of his body.How Sri Bhagavan underwent surgery  
without any anaesthesia! How Sri Ramakrishna when down with Throat  
cancer,unable to even swallow Liquids could not bring himself to wish that the  
body should recover-How the Divine Mother(Sri Ramakrishna!)told him-'Is it not  
enough that you are eating through other mouths'!   
I am not saying that all need to be like this-at the same time,it does give an  
idea of what Jnana or the state of 'summa Iru' is.This is the order of  
immensity.   
There are many seekers who get caught on the way with a little peace, a little  
vastness, a little quietude-and they think that they have arrived.One only  
needs to consolidate this quietude and this is jnana for them.   
This is why sri Bhagavan never taught the 'Just Be' teaching.He only stressed  
'self-enquiry' and to trace the source of the Mind.   
Similiarly Sri Ramakrishna narrated this parable: Quote  
> **The story of the wood-cutter**   
> "Once upon a time a wood-cutter went into a forest to chop wood. There  
> suddenly he met a   
> brahmachari. The holy man said to him, 'My good man, go forward.' On

If we get stuck somewhere,we cannot throw the towel and call all this as  
unnecessary.It just means that we are striving in an egoistic way-we are still  
not recognizing the role of Grace.We are stuck on account of this.It is the  
wind of Grace that can carry us home.   
Wishing you the very Best.   
Namaskar.

 Looks like Toothache is linked with jnana!   
There is a humorous anecdote that Sri Nochur Venkatraman narrated.It seems  
that one person came to him and enquired about the efficacy of Transcen  
**dental Meditation**.Nochur told him that he only knew 'Dental Meditation'  
and this is truly effective.   
'What is Dental Meditation?' asked the other person.   
'It is what Sri Ramakrishna taught ' said Nochur and told him this saying of  
Sri Ramakrishna: Quote  
> MASTER:" **One can meditate even with eyes open. One can meditate even while  
> talking. Take the   
> case of a man with toothache**.   
> TUTOR OF THE TAGORES: "Yes, sir. I know that very well." (All laugh.)

Yes, in the way that lack of jnana leads to samsara (toothache). We prefer to  
be in pain rather than follow Guru and His teachings (the dentist) and be  
free. We always excuse saying "Later or tomorrow". Most people pospone their  
sadhana all their life, others even forget about what they have promised to  
themselves to do. Others do it occasionally only when they feel sad, depressed  
or some dramatic event reminds them about cruelty of the world

dear Ravi, Ramana,   
Not a directly related story, but somewhat the same. Once a devotee asked Sri  
Bhagavan: Bhagavan! Can I swat the mosquito   
that stings me during meditation? Or should I leave it as it is?   
Sri Bhagavan smilingly replied: You can swat the mosquito. For that act, mukti  
will not be denied to you. You can also leave   
it as it is. For that act, mukti will not be given to you. In true  
meditation, one will not even experience whether a mosquito   
is sitting on your body and it is stinging you!   
Arunachala Siva.

Love flowing like a stream of oil towards the Supreme Lord, even without his  
desire, takes the mind of a person surely to his true form.   
 V. 4, Ch. 16, Sri Ramana Gita   
Dear Devotees,   
Truth is that we cannot live without loving the Lord. We cannot help being  
devoted. Can we ? We all love ourselves. Dont we? That is the experience.  
This is because the Self, in truth, is the dearest object. Sri Bhagwan says  
that the Self or Lord is not somewhere else but is inside each of us. AND IN  
LOVING ONESELF, ONE LOVES ONLY THE SELF.   
Dear devotees, we must know the Consciousness which alone is the experience of  
the True Love. Sensory experiences are not the Consciousness. These are  
spurious and the false reflection and only a semblance of the True Love.   
Thank you,   
 Anil

Contnd from my last post: Dear Devotees,   
Sri Bhagwan has taught that to abide as one really is in the Heart, one must  
love the Self. Unless one loves the Self as ones own Swarupa, it is  
impossible to abide as the Self in the Heart.   
The Self is of the Nature of HappinessSukha Swarupa. Has not every being love  
flowing towards itself? When one realises the Atma-Swarupa, devoid of ego, the  
Supreme Lord shines as ones own Self.   
When love natural melts towards the Supreme Lord and reaches there where  
abides the Belovedthe Supreme Consciousness who is the same as Sri Arunachala  
or Sri Bhagwan, He reveals Himself as Pure Knowledge and that is Jnana.  
Therefore, Atma-Jnana is also called by another name Parabhakti or the  
Supreme Devotion. Hence, Sri Bhagwan teaches that Parabhakti and Atma-Jnana  
are not different.   
Thank you,   
 Anil

Dear Devotees,   
Sri Adi Shankara sings in Sivananda Lahiri: Bhakti is a matter only for experience and not for words. How can logic and  
other polemics be of any real use ? INSTEAD, THINK OF THE FEET OF THE EVER  
BLISSFUL LORD AND DRINK THE NECTAR!   
Wherever or however it be, only let the mind lose itself in the Supreme. It is  
Yoga! It is Bliss. OR THE YOGI OR THE BLISS INCARNATE!   
To worship God with flowers and other external objects is troublesome. Only  
lay the single flower, the heart, at the feet of Siva and remain at Peace. NOT  
TO KNOW THIS SIMPLE THING AND TO WANDER ABOUT! HOW FOOLISH! WHAT MISERY!   
THE MIND LOSING ITSELF IN SIVAS FEET IS DEVOTION. IGNORANCE LOST! KNOWLEDGE!

Dear anil,   
Only yesterday when I was in Chennai to attend a wedding, an old spiritual  
lady was talking about Sivananda Lahari to me.   
Sri Sankara says: No flowers are required to be submitted. No puja is  
necessary. Only His names should be chanted silently.   
No naivdedyam (food offering) is necessary. Only our monkey mind should be  
offered to Him. No Oblations are needed.   
Cry and cry and give the tears to Him and this is the oblations.   
Arunachala Siva.

This indeed is a very beautiful and inspiring Verse. Thank you so much, sir.   
Dear sir, I have not read Sri Adi Shankaras Shivananda Lahiri. But whenever I  
read cited Verses from the great work, they touched and inspired me greatly.   
Before coming to Sri Bhagwan, I had not studied a single work by Sri Adi  
Shankara, though I regarded Him a great spiritual teacher on Advaita who  
revived Sanatana Dharma. But when I came to Sri Bhagwan, I gradually  
understood His Greatness. And since then, I have studied Viveka Chudamani,  
Atma Bodha, etc. composed by Him. Now I also know that the essence of His  
Teaching is the same as Sri Bhagwan.

Dear anil,   
Sri Adi Sankara's Sivananda Lahari is a beautiful poem of 100 verses on Siva.  
It is full of bhatki. It will be delightful to see   
a Brhama Jnani who went to the pinnacle of Jnana at the age of 8 in the  
presence of Govinda Bhagavadpada to come down   
to our level and compose many short stotras and long poems like Sri Sivananda  
Lahari for us. Sri Sankara also wrote Sri   
Soundarya Lahari describing the incomparable beauty of Mother but there, there  
are many mantras embedded. One should   
read them carefully without pronunciation mistakes and built in mantras should  
be initiated by a guru in Sakta marga well   
versed and competent. Sivananda Lahari is not so. It is a beautiful and poem  
of sheer devotion. Both the books are   
available in Sri Ramakrishna Math, with Sanskrit slokas and English meanings.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sri Subramanian Sir,   
By composing a beautiful and sublime poem of 100 Verses on the devotion to  
Lord Siva, such as, Sivananda Lahari, I do not think that the Great Acharya  
descended from the pinnacle of Jnana and came down to our level. For example,  
these sublime verses below also imply that Jnana and Bhakti are the same  
besides portraying ananya Bhakti to the Lord Shiva.

That which should be attained is true Jnana; that which the mind should  
meditate upon is the feet of God; that on which one should firmly depend upon  
is satsang; that which should well up in the Heart is peace.   
 V. 501, GVK, Edited by Sri D.Godman   
Sri Muruganar comments that the phrase, that which should well up in the  
Heart is peace, explains the greatness of the stillness which is known as the  
Peace, and the phrase, that which the mind should meditate upon is the Feet  
of God, implies surrender.

By turning towards the Self, a person should dive within and enquire, Who is  
the bogus entity who says I? Through that enquiry he should die willingly  
in the Atma-swarupa, which is devoid of the ego, and which is the true form of  
God. The excellence of the state of mauna that then shines, and with which he  
is indistinguishably merged, is the consummation of the practice of surrender.   
 V. 1189, GVK, Edited by Sri D. Godman   
Dear Devotees,   
The ego being unreal, it should die consciously, willingly and deliberately in  
Vichara. To renounce the ego thus is to offer up ones self in surrender and  
to be absorbed, through surrender of the self, in the non-dual state of Mauna,  
is the Supreme Truth. One is then indistinguishably merged in the excellence  
of the state of Mauna in which dualistic appearances do not arise. This is the  
perfect consummation of the practice of surrender.   
The cited Verse also explains that God is not different from Atma-swarupa.  
Atma-swarupa alone is the true form of God.   
ONE IS. THE TRUE FORM OF GOD IS THE NATURAL STATE OF PURE BEING.   
Thank you,

Devotee : How can one worship God best?   
Sri Bhagwan : How can you best worship God? Why, by not trying to worship him,  
by giving up your whole self to him, and showing that every thought, every  
action, is only a working of that One Life (God).   
Dear Devotees,   
God works perfectly in our unconscious virtuous actions. Sri Bhagwan says that  
even a Master, when instructing, is far from any thought of instructing. To  
feel a doubt or a difficulty in His Presence is to elicit the wonderful words  
which will clear away that doubt or the difficulty. Those words, being words  
of Grace, never fail. A Master with His heart fixed on God, realising  
perfectly that no action is a personal one, making no claim to have either  
originated the thought or to have been the means of destroying a doubt, saying  
I or Mine seeing only God in every thought and action, whether they be  
yours or His, feels no surprise, no special pleasure to Himself in having  
allayed your doubt. He never desires to feel pleasures.   
He says: Who is it that feels pleasure ? Why, God.   
What is pleasure?   
Why the appreciation-instinctive or otherwise of God.   
Who is the so called I?   
I is God.   
God is pleasure. If I desire perpetual pleasure, I must forget myself, and be  
that which is pleasure itself, viz., God.

Devotee: I long for Bhakti. I want more of this longing. Even realization does  
not matter to me. Let me be strong in my longing.   
Sri Bhagwan : If the longing is there, realization will be forced on you even  
if you do not want it.   
Dear Devotees,   
That is it. Longing for Bhakti! Sri Bhagwan says that we should long for it  
intensely so that the mind melts in devotion.. After camphor burns away no  
residue is left. The mind is like the camphor. When it is merged or resolved  
into the Self, without leaving slightest trace behind, it is Realisation of  
the Self.

herself Zaz.   
She become famous by this song,singing it on the streets in France.   
It is so soulful and joyful,and i am in love with this song.   
Video is with English subtitles.   
http://lyricstranslate.com   
Give me a suite at the Ritz hotel, I don't want that   
Chanel's jewellery, I don't want that   
Give me a limo, what would I do with it?   
Offer me staff, what would I do with it?   
A mansion in Neufchatel, it's not for me   
Offer me the Eiffel tower, what would I do with it?   
I want love, joy, good spirit   
It's not your money that will make me happy   
I want to die with a hand on my heart   
Let's go together, let's discover my freedom,   
Forget all your prejudice, welcome to my reality   
I'm fed up with your good manners, it's too much for me   
I eat with my hands, I'm like that   
I speak loud and I'm direct, sorry   
Let's end the hypocrisy, I'm out of it   
I'm tired of double-talks   
Look at me, I'm not even mad at you, I'm just like that   
I want love, joy, good spirit   
It's not your money that will make me happy   
I want to die with a hand on my heart   
Let's go together, let's discover my freedom,   
Forget all your prejudice, welcome to my reality.

**_This is another song from Zaz,named The Fairy.   
It is beautiful,and video is very cute and beautiful too.   
http://lyricstranslate.com   
The Fairy   
I also have a fairy at home   
On the streaming gutters   
I found her on a roof   
In the burning hot train of her dress   
It was one morning, it smelt like coffee   
Everything was covered in frost   
She had hidden under a book   
And the moon was ending up drunk   
I also have a fairy at home   
And the train of her dress is burnt   
She certainly knows she cannot   
And will never be able to fly again   
Others tried before her   
Before you, another one was here   
I found her folded under her wings   
And I thought she was cold   
I also have a fairy at home   
From my shelves she looks down   
To the television, thinking   
That outside it's war   
She reads miscellaneous periodicals   
And stays at home   
At the window, counting the hours   
At the window, counting the hours   
I also have a fairy at home   
And when she takes her breakfast   
She makes a noise with her roasted wings   
And I know well she's dissolute   
But I prefer to kiss her   
Or hold her between my fingers   
I also have a fairy at home   
Who would like to fly but cannot...

**_Deliver Us by Ofra Haza / Eden Riegel   
[Hebrew Slaves]   
Mud...   
Sand...   
Water...   
Straw...   
[Egyptian Guards]   
Faster!   
[Hebrew Slaves]   
Mud...And lift   
Sand...And Pull   
Water...And raise up...   
Straw...   
[Egyptian Guards]   
Faster!   
[Hebrew Slaves]   
With the sting of the whip on my shoulder   
With the salt of my sweat on my brow   
Elohim, God on high   
Can you hear your people cry: Help us now   
This dark hour...   
Deliver us   
Hear our call   
Deliver us   
Lord of all   
Remember us, here in this burning sand   
Deliver us   
There's a land you promised us   
Deliver us to the promised land...   
[Yocheved]   
Yal-di ha-tov veh ha-rach   
(My good and tender son)   
Al ti-ra veh al tif-chad   
(Don't be frightened and don't be scared)   
My son, I have nothing I can give   
But this chance that you may live   
I pray we'll meet again   
If He will deliver us   
[Hebrew Slaves]   
Deliver us   
Hear our prayer   
Deliver us   
From despair   
These years of slavery grow   
too cruel to stand   
Deliver us   
There's a land you promised us   
Deliver us   
Out of bondage and   
Deliver us to the promised land...   
[Yocheved]   
Hush now, my baby   
Be still, love, don't cry   
Sleep as you're rocked by the stream   
Sleep and remember my last lullaby   
So I'll be with you when you dream   
River, o river   
Flow gently for me   
Such precious cargo you bear   
Do you know somewhere   
he can live free?   
River, deliver him there...   
[Young Miriam]   
Brother, you're safe now   
And safe may you stay   
For I have a prayer just for you: Grow, baby brother   
Come back someday   
Come and deliver us, too...   
[Hebrew Slaves]   
Deliver us   
Send a shepherd to shepherd us   
And deliver us to the promised land   
[Yocheved]   
Deliver us!

**_The Bare Necessities by Phil Harris, Bruce Reitherman   
Look for the bare necessities   
The simple bare necessities   
Forget about your worries and your strife   
I mean the bare necessities   
Old Mother Nature's recipes   
That brings the bare necessities of life   
Wherever I wander, wherever I roam   
I couldn't be fonder of my big home   
The bees are buzzin' in the tree   
To make some honey just for me   
When you look under the rocks and plants   
And take a glance at the fancy ants   
Then maybe try a few   
The bare necessities of life will come to you   
They'll come to you!   
Look for the bare necessities   
The simple bare necessities   
Forget about your worries and your strife   
I mean the bare necessities   
That's why a bear can rest at ease   
With just the bare necessities of life   
Now when you pick a pawpaw   
Or a prickly pear   
And you prick a raw paw   
Next time beware   
Don't pick the prickly pear by the paw   
When you pick a pear   
Try to use the claw   
But you don't need to use the claw   
When you pick a pear of the big pawpaw   
Have I given you a clue ?   
The bare necessities of life will come to you   
They'll come to you!   
So just try and relax, yeah cool it   
Fall apart in my backyard   
'Cause let me tell you something little britches   
If you act like that bee acts, uh uh   
You're working too hard   
And don't spend your time lookin' around   
For something you want that can't be found   
When you find out you can live without it   
And go along not thinkin' about it   
I'll tell you something true   
The bare necessities of life will come to you

**_Miracles (When You Believe)   
Many nights we've prayed   
With no proof anyone could hear   
In our hearts a hopeful song   
We barely understood   
Now we are not afraid   
Although we know there's much to fear   
We were moving mountains long before we knew we could   
There can be miracles   
When you believe   
Though hope is frail   
It's hard to kill   
Who knows what miracles   
You can achieve   
When you believe?   
Somehow you will   
You will when you believe   
In this time of fear   
When prayer so often proved in vain   
Hope seemed like the summer birds   
Too swiftly flown away   
Yet now I'm standing here   
With heart so full I can't explain   
Seeking faith and speaking words   
I never thought I'd say   
There can be miracles when you believe   
Though hope is frail   
It's hard to kill   
Who knows what miracles   
You can achieve   
When you believe?   
Somehow you will   
You will when you believe   
There can be miracles when you believe   
Though hope is frail   
It's hard to kill   
Who knows what miracles   
You can achieve   
When you believe?   
Somehow you will   
Now you will   
You will when you believe   
You will when you believe

I have heard of the story of your   
standing with mercy before Dhruva,   
What is the secret of your becoming

Please also tell me why you saved an   
ungrateful monkey wandering in forest,   
And so please understand that it is not good

In this clear moonlight (that makes a day of the night),   
I strain my eyebrows hard and look in your direction,   
the mellow tunes of your flute come floating in the breeze...   
my eyes feel drowsy and a new feeling sweeps my being   
Come! Mould my tender heart, make it full and fill me with joy!   
Come! take me to a lonely grove and fill me with the emotions   
of ecstatic union!   
You are the one who danced and made merry on the sun-bathed   
waves of the ocean! Am I to go on pleading for you with melting heart,   
While you are enjoying yourself with other women? Is it right?   
Is it proper? Is it what dharma is? My heart dances even like your   
eardrops do when you blissfully play the flute! (My sad heart is all aflutter)

Nagaraj,   
Thanks very much for the wonderful compositions by Sri sadasiva Brahmam and  
Oothukadu Venkata kavi on Lord Sri Krishna.One of the best rendition of the  
alai payudhe that I have listened to is by Pithukuli Murugadas with his

Nagaraj/Friends,   
This is another superb composition by that great devotee Oothukadu Venkata  
kavi-pAl vadiyum mugam. It is beautifully rendered by pithukuli Murugadas: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWuBLq0ebxA   
Namaskar.

Pallavi   
ఎంత ముద్దో ఎంత సొగసో   
ఎవరి వల్ల వర్ణింప తగునే   
enta muddō enta sogasō   
evari-valla varṇimpa tagunē   
How charming and how elegant is He!   
Whoever is capable of describing!   
Anupallavi   
ఎంత వారలైన కాని కామ   
చింతాక్రాంతులైనారు (ఎ)   
enta vāralaina kāni kāma   
cintākrāntu-laināru   
No matter how great people are, they   
became besieged by thoughts of lust.   
atta mīda kanulāsaku dāsulai2   
satta bhagavata vēsulairi   
dutta pāla ruci3 teliyu sāmyamē   
dhurīṇuḍau tyāgarāja nutuḍu (enta)   
అత్త మీద కనులాసకు దాసులై   
సత్త భాగవత వేసులైరి   
దుత్త పాల రుచి తెలియు సామ్యమే   
ధురీణుడౌ త్యాగరాజ నుతుడు (ఎ)   
yet, they pretend as true devotees of the Lord.   
Much like jug knowing the taste of milk!   
How charming and how elegant is He - praised by   
this tyAgarAja â who bears burden of the Universe!   
Whoever is capable of describing!
