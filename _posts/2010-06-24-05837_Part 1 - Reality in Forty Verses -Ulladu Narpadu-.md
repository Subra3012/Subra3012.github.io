## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Part 1 - Reality in Forty Verses (Ulladu Narpadu)

Once Bhagavan ramana composed twenty Tamil stanzas containing his important  
teachings. They were not written in any particular order to form a poem. Sri  
Muruganar therefore suggested that Bhagavan should write twenty stanzas more  
to make it the conventional forty. Accordingly, Bhagavan composed twenty more  
stanzas. Out of these forty, Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni selected two as the  
invocatory stanzas.   
Then Bhagavan wrote two more to complete the forty. Some of the stanzas were  
translations from Sanskrit, but as devotees wanted all the forty verses to be  
original they were eliminated and new stanzas composed in their place.   
The verses were all arranged in a continuous order to form a poem. Later, a   
supplement consisting of a second forty verses was added. So indifferent to  
authorship was Bhagavan that he did not write all those supplementary verses  
himself. When he came upon a suitable one he used it  mostly translations  
from Sanskrit   
 and when not, he made one. The verses eliminated from the original forty  
verses were included in the supplement.   
These eighty verses are the most comprehensive exposition of the Maharshis  
teaching. A number of translations have been made and commentaries written on  
them. They have been published as separate books by the ashram under the  
titles Ulladu Narpadu, Sad Vidya and Truth Revealed. Bhagavan translated these  
verses into Telugu prose under the name of Unnadi Nalubadi and into Malayalam  
verse under the name of Saddarsanam.   
 **Invocation**   
1\. Unless Reality exists, can thought of it arise? Since,devoid of thought,  
Reality exists within as Heart, how to know the Reality we term the Heart? To  
know That is merely to be That in the Heart.   
2\. When those who are in dread of death seek refuge at the feet of the  
deathless, birthless Lord Supreme, their ego and attachments die; and they,  
now deathless, think no more of death.   
 **The Text**   
1\. Since we know the world, we must concede for both a common Source, single  
but with the power of seeming many.The picture of names and forms, the  
onlooker, the screen, the light that illumines  all these are verily He.   
2\. On three entities  the individual, God and the world  every creed is  
based. That the One becomes the three and that always the three are three,  
are said only while the ego lasts. To lose the I and in the Self to stay is  
the State Supreme.   
 **3\. The World is true; No, it is a false appearance;The World is  
Mind; No, it is not; The World is pleasant;No, it is not  What avails  
such talk? To leave the world alone and know the Self, to go beyond all  
thought of One and Two, this egoless condition is the common goal of  
all.**   
4\. If Self has form, the world and God likewise have form. If Self is without  
form, by whom and how can form (of world and God) be seen? Without the eye,  
can there be sight or spectacle? The Self, the real Eye, is infinite.   
5\. The body is made up of the five sheaths;in the term body all the five are  
included. Without the body the world is not. Has one without the body ever  
seen the world?   
 **6\. The world is made up of the five kinds of sense perceptions and nothing  
else. And those perceptions are felt as objects by the five senses. Since  
through the senses the mind alone perceives the world, is the world other than  
the mind?   
7\. Though the world and mind rise and fade together,the world shines by the  
light of the mind. The ground whence the world and mind arise, and wherein  
they set, that Perfection rises not nor sets but ever shines. That is  
Reality.**   
8\. Under whatever name or form we worship It, It leads us on to knowledge of  
the nameless, formless Absolute. Yet,to see ones true Self in the Absolute,  
to subside into It and be one with It, this is the true Knowledge of the  
Truth.   
9\. Twos and threes depend upon one thing, the ego.If one asks in ones  
Heart, What is this ego? and finds it,they slip away. Only those who have  
found this know the Truth, and they will never be perplexed.   
10\. There is no knowledge without ignorance; and without knowledge ignorance  
cannot be. To ask, Whose is this knowledge? Whose this ignorance? and thus  
to know the   
primal Self, this alone is Knowledge.   
11\. Without knowing the Self that knows, to know all objects is not  
knowledge; it is only ignorance. Self, the ground of knowledge and the non-  
Self, being known, both knowledge and ignorance fall away.   
12\. True Knowledge is being devoid of knowledge as well as ignorance of  
objects. Knowledge of objects is not true knowledge. Since the Self shines  
self-luminous, with nothing else for It to know, with nothing else to know It,  
the Self is Knowledge. Nescience It is not.   
13\. The Self that is Awareness, that alone is true. The knowledge which is  
various is ignorance. And even ignorance,which is false, cannot exist apart  
from the Self. False are the many jewels, for apart from gold, which alone is  
true, they cannot exist.   
14\. You and he  these appear only when I does.But when the nature of  
the I is sought and the ego is destroyed, you and he are at an end. What  
shines then as   
the One alone is the true Self.   
15\. Past and future are dependent on the present. The past was present in its  
time and the future will be present too.Ever-present is the present. **To seek  
to know the future and the past, without knowing the truth of time today, is  
to try to count without the number One.**   
 **16\. Without us there is no time nor space. If we are only bodies, we are  
caught up in time and space. But are we bodies? Now, then and always  here,  
now and everywhere  we are the same. We exist, timeless and spaceless we.**

Dear prasanth,   
Nice summary. Upadesa Undiyar, ULLadu Narpadu and ULLadu   
Narpadu Anubandham, - supplement, are considered to be the   
Prastana thrayam of Bhagavan Ramana. Among the ancient scriptures, Srimad  
Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads and Brahma Sutram   
are said to be the prastana thrayam.   
ULLadu Narapdu has to be read again and again to understand it and take it  
into the Heart. In fact, Sri Sadhu Om says that one should read the  
Supplement first and then the main 2+40 verses.   
Brahmasri Nochur Venkataraman says that the first two invocatory verses  
contain the quintessence of Bhagavan's teachings. The first says about self  
enquiry. The second states about surrender. That is all.   
He has also said that the Verses 23 to 32, the ten verses are the heart of the  
whole scripture.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear prasanth,   
For Verse 16 of ULLadu Narpadu, Muruganar has given some   
beautiful verses in Guru Vachaka Kovai, to elaborate the essence   
of that original verse.   
Verse 464: Reality is only the supremely blissful consciousness that shines  
without any kind of differences, in the focused state of a mind,   
that has become mature, by virtue of living entirely free of desires.   
Verse 465: The One continues to exist as the sole existing entity   
at all times and at all places and from time immemorial. [Nadethu NaaLethu..  
in original]. Therefore, other than that One, which is   
inescapably present as one's own reality, all times and all places   
will, becoming mere concepts, cease to exist.   
In Day by Day entry dated 10th April 1946, Bhagavan Ramana says: In reality, saying 'We must see Brahman in everything and everywhere' is also  
not quite correct. Only that stage is final,   
where there is no seeing, where there is no time or space. There   
will be no seer, seeing, [nor] an object to see. What exists then   
is only the Infinite Eye.   
Arunachala Siva.
