Dear Sir,   
I am Planning to visit Sri Ramanasramam soon. Could you please let me know how  
can I come to thiruvannamalai from Pune? Should I come through Chennai? What  
is the nearest airport and railway station to Thiruvannammalai?   
Thanks

Dear talluriravi,   
From Pune, you can come down to Chennai by flight or train.   
From Chennai, you can come down to Tiruvannamalai, either   
by private car or by bus service. The distance is 190 Kms.   
The private cab covers it in 5 hours and the bus by 6 1/2   
hours. There could be some stops for lunch, snacks and coffee/tea.   
In Tiruvannamalai and inside the Asramam, the timings etc.,   
have been given by me in many posts under Ashram/Arunachala   
topics. Please go through them.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Talluriravi,   
There is no good answer unless you can share a car to the ashram with a few  
others. From the airport, one option is to take the bus from Koyambedu  
terminus. The advantage is you will get a seat for the 5 hour journey. Buses  
run every 20 minutes or so. The disadvantage is the trip to Koyambedu from the  
airport could cost you around Rs 150 by auto. The other option is to catch the  
bus at Guindy which is nearer the airport. But you cannot be assured of a  
seat. Are you prepared to stand for 4 hours or more in a bus? If taking the  
bus, give yourself enough time and catch one of the Express buses. You may  
want to get some food as well since you will not be able to reach the ashram  
for lunch if you start after 7.30. Have a good trip.

Dear Ravi,   
My sincerer apologies for not replying to your message on Orkut. I have been  
off orkut for some time. I see that you have directions to Tiruvanamalai from  
many Bhaktas.I do not want to add to it.   
Regards

Hello all,   
My trip to Arunachalam went on very well. Thanks for all your help. I stayed  
in the pleasant Ramanasramam from evening of 27th Feb to the morning of 3rd  
Mar. I felt I am blessed to visit this place and spend some time in the  
presence of Bhagawan Sri Ramana maharshi and his beloved Arunachala. I am  
heart fully saying that I absolutely felt the presence of Ramana Maharshi.  
Tears rolled out of my eyes when I first saw the conch statue of Sri ramana.  
It was amazing to see the beautiful slopes of Arunachala during Girivalayam.  
How fortunate we should be to see the peak of Arunachala from the courtyard of  
Sri Ramana. I felt how he might have spent his time in the great Arunachala  
temple, Patala Lingam, Virupaksha cave and Skandasramam. Truely its an amazing  
experience   
The one thing that burnt my heart was when people are casually taking snaps of  
the Samadhi of Sri Ramana. As we all feel Ramana to be present there, I felt  
bad when people are clicking their Camera's on samadhi. Those photos are  
available in the book store and I thought could have purchased from which I  
did.   
Thanks again one and all..   
Arunachala Ramana   
Ramanachala Aruna..   
Ravi

Dear telluravi,   
Thanks for the post. If one could shed tears in His Presence, that is a sure  
indication,   
that you will be taken care of, by Him.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thank you very much grhluna and Subramanian...   
One strange thing happened to me in the main temple...I went to the temple..It  
looked a bit complex to me..Somehow I got hold of the 1000 pillared temple and  
the patala lingam..I spent some time thinking of how Ramana might have spent  
there oblivious of all the suffering due to the bites by small  
creatures....Then immediately I went to the rajagopuram and try to dramtize  
the situation how all the gates till the sanctum sactorium were open inviting  
Ramana...   
The strange thing was I didn't visit the main shrine the annamalai...I went  
there. .and there was a Q..somehow I thought I came to see how ramana spent  
his life here..so my job is done..and immediately returned back not visiting  
the Lord...   
I dont know whether I have done anything wrong in that....I sincerely hope  
not...   
One more thing was..I met a sadhu on the Arunachala hill..he claimed himself  
as wandering sadhu on Aruna hill..He asked a couple of questions that why did  
I like Ramana..and he told that he want to come to Pune..to visit Bheema  
shankar and took my address..He asked to help him financially when ever he  
come to Pune..and finally gave me Ramana's photo.. I didn't understand what  
does he meant by that?   
Did any of you met that kind of sadhu's?   
Thanks   
Ravi

Dear telluravi,   
Thanks for nice description of your experiences. The Sadhus are aplenty in  
Arunachala.   
Some of them may be bogus. Definitely money part of it. Once I met a person  
in   
the Hill. He gave me a small piece of rock, about the size of an eraser and  
said   
that that was from summit and it was very helpful for keeps. I paid him Rs  
20.00!   
I asked an inmate. He smilingly said: "You might have been duped. Does not  
matter.   
If Arunachala is Brahman, the small piece is also Brahman. Brahman cut out  
from   
Brahman is also Brahman. Everything is Poornam.,"   
The Patala Lingam shrine, you are seeing now. You must have seen when  
Bhagavan   
Ramana was there. It was near-completely dilapitated. All gravel, dust, rock  
pieces,   
cactus growth. Smt Talyarkhan renovated it in 1949.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks for your kind and warm responses...I feel fortunate to share my  
experiences with many ardent devotees of Sri Ramana...   
I have one more question. I climbed the Arunachala from backside of the  
Ramanshramam. At the starting point..I saw some huts and after about a 100  
meters I saw 1/2 persons..Keenly watching the visitors...May I know who are  
those..and what do they do on the hill...   
I heard that Bhagawan has been living in the current Ramasramam area from  
1922...I also read that there used to small huts/houses before the current  
buildings..Please correct me if I go wrong anywhere in the chronology...I  
would like to know in which area of the current Ramanasramama Ramana used to  
live before the construction of the old hall as well as the temple...   
Thanks   
Ravi

Dear telluravi,   
Bhagavan Ramana was living in a hut near the thatched shed   
over Mother's Samadhi. The devotees did not want to keep the   
Samadhi under open sky and so a thatched shed was put up.   
There again, was built a hut where Bhagavan Ramana and a few   
others (perhaps Kunju Swami ) were staying. It is in the year   
1922. The Old Hall and kitchen were done with Annamalai Swami's   
supervision a little later. The photograph is available in Osborne's   
book.   
Arunachala Siva.
