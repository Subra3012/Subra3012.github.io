On 8 May 2009 I started off to Tiruvannamalai from Bangalore reached there by  
11 in the morning, kept my luggage in safe in cloak room, did a fast search  
for a room unfortunately no rooms were available and some that were there were  
priced Rs 1300-1500, the heat was on, left to Ramana Ashram we waited for the  
doors to open by 2 in the afternoon, some people were lying inside the Ramana  
samadhi, its really bad and some one should stop this act, people were in  
fact inside the samadhi to escape the heat rather than to gain peace with  
Bhagavan. Left Ashram for the temple to join the queue, we had planned to go  
for Rs 100 or 50 queue darshan but this was quite opposite there was queue  
outside the temple complex which further divides between the type of darshan.  
so we abandoned it, look for the room, finally a lodge owner promise that a  
room could be available only after 9 pm, ok we booked and left for girivalam  
at 6.30 pm and finished the path by 11 pm headed straight for the lodge, thank  
god room was available.   
Next morning 9 May 2009, seeing the heavy rush of people to the temple, headed  
to bus stand to board the bus for Kanchipuram, it so happens all the buses  
were halted, no buses were to be found in Tiruvananamalai bus stand, at last  
10.30 am found one, reached Kanchipuram by 1.30 pm, the heat made us sweat  
out liters of water out of our bodies. Got a room nearby the bus stand, around  
3 pm head for Varadharaja Perumal Temple by a share auto and then for  
Ekambaranatha Temple and later for Kailasanathar Temple (it was nearly dark,  
but the temple was simply majestic) headed back to the lodge.   
Last day, 10 May 2009, morining headed for Sri Ulaganatha Swami Temple and  
from there Kamakshi Amman Temple and back to Varadharaja Perumal Temple as  
there was time available (brought some prasadam for home) headed back to  
lodge, Left Kanchipuram at 10.30 am to Arrakonam on the way we planned to  
visit Tirutani Temple so extended our journey to the Tirutani Temple, reached  
therey by 12.15 pm, rushed to temple bus stand to board the hill bus, damn the  
bus moves finally, on the hill rush again for Rs 25 queue and had a very good  
darshan of Murgan and rush back again to temple bus stand, oh there is a hug  
queue for the temple bus, no time we have to catch the train at Arrokanam so  
we take a auto from the hill and took the bus to arrakonam reaching there by  
1.30 pm had lunch and headed for the railway station, the train arrives 10  
minutes late, reached Bangalore 1hr late

Dear karthikeyan. M   
Happy to see you back in the Forum. Do not worry about the various   
difficulties in the pilgrimage. It strenghtens our resolve. I am happy   
you have covered many temples. This is the hottest season in Tamil   
Nadu. Yesterday, Tiruttani was 44 degrees celsius. Ultimately the   
end justifies the means. One way to make it somewhat better, is to   
write to Sri Ramanasramam or Seshadri Asramam for rooms. They   
give you room but you have to finalize your travel plan and write   
to them clear one month in advance. In December during Mahadeepam, you have  
to write to them clear three months before!   
The rooms in these two asramams are absolutely free and you can   
if you feel like, give them some donation and take a receipt. Food   
in Sri Ramanasramam is also free. You have go be there only in time.   
Regarding people sitting or sleeping before Bhagavan Ramana's   
Samadhi: Why are you feeling bad about it? So long as they (children) does  
not make it dirty by urination, it is fine. After all, Guru is the final  
resting place for every seeker. Only in Old Hall   
and in Mathrubhuteswara Temple, (Mother's Temple), which is a   
formal temple, nobody is allowed to lie down. One can sit there but should  
not lie down. You might have even seen in Varadharaja   
and Ekambara temples, people sitting at the outer portals and even   
sleeping in 1000 pillared mantapa. In the olden days, temples were built as a  
safe place in times of war, floods and other natural calamities. The king  
used to allow the people inside the temples and feed them in times of war and  
ravages of natural calamities.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks for the post, but may be my earlier message wasn't proper, Some people  
were lying inside the Old Hall (i.e with white marble surface) this made me  
angry.   
Thanks

Dear karthikeyan. M   
It does not matter. There are three places which are halls   
in Asramam.   
1\. The front portion of Mother's Temple, where you find the   
statue of Bhagavan to your right as you enter, is called Jubilee   
Hall or New Hall, which was made as a thatched shed in 1946.   
2\. The Old Hall is the one near the dininghall/kitchen, behind   
the well, is where Bhagavan sat for more than 24 years and   
great works like Talks, Day by Day, Sri Ramana Gita bhashyam were written /  
read out. This is the most vibrant place. Here one should not lie  
down/sleep. Utter silence is maintained.   
3\. The Samadhi Hall is the largest one before Bhagavan's   
Samadhi, which is also a resting place during rains/hot   
summer. In the evenings, book reading and parayana take   
place here.   
Arunachala Siva.
