## Report of malware on other websites

Anti-virus software on my computer detected a trojan horse type of malware   
on Nithyananda's website - in the link 'ashrams&centers' on his website  
homepage.   
I am not sure if it is appropriate to report malware on other websites here,   
but I report it for other members' safety,   
thinking that somebody might visit his website out of curiousity just like I  
did.

Dear grhluna,   
Excellent. Cosmic Law or God's Law acts very subtly. Bhagavan Ramana calls  
it as   
Iswara Niyathi (Who am I?). He says in raja yoga, when breath is controlled,  
the   
mind is controlled, albeit temporarily. But in sleep, when the mind is  
controlled,   
the breath does not stop. It comes in and goes out steadily. Why? Why this   
deviation from general rule? Because, when you sleep, and if breath too  
stops   
as the mind, then the fellows near your bed will think that you are dead! To   
prevent this misunderstanding (and a possible cremation), your breath  
continues.   
This is Cosmic Law. This is the most powerful of all laws. One earth quake  
can   
kill thousands of people. One Tusnami can kill lakhs of people. The Haiti  
earthquake   
even slowed down the earth rotation by one and a half micro second!   
It is god's stretching out his limbs, because he is bored with human beings!   
Arunachala Siva.
