When Jesus walked on water did he get his feet wet?

...so, anyway, here's a good answer somebody once gave me right off the top of  
her head: "No, since he was a good Jewish boy, he did what his mother told him and wore  
his galoches!"

Dear Chuck Cliff,   
You have come back to the Forum after a long break. There are   
two things: One is Jesus and Sri Bhagavan are beyond the concepts   
of pain and pleasure, and both [at least Sri Bhagavan, about which   
I have read] can enjoy the jokes cut on themselves by others. Secondly, if  
Jesus could walk on water, he would have definitely   
been ensure that his sole did not become wet.   
However, such jokes on gods, saints and son of god, make not only Christians  
but even Hindus like me, [who love and respect Christ] feel pain.   
If you had cut some jokes [black humor] on Islam and their prophets, there  
will be a "fatwa" on you and it may require a   
Obama to save your life and prevent dangers to you on everyday of   
your life.   
Arunachala Siva.
