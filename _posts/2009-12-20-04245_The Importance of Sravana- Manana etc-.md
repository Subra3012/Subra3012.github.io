## The Importance of Sravana, Manana etc.,

Question: Why is it that the wise say that hearing alone (Sravana) can   
create a distorted understanding of any profound Truth? Why   
are we told to first hear, then reflect and assimilate so that   
knowledge can become experienced?   
Answer: What we hear must be heard and digested within, and then it   
becomes distilled wisdom. Like the cow eating grass, first in   
a hurry and then meditatively sitting in the shade and only then   
does she convert it into food, swallow it back again and convert   
it into milk. So how man extracts wisdom out off all talk and   
reading is to think deeply about it and then dive deeply within   
in meditation. In that way, he really disgests what he has heard   
or read and then it flows into him as an experience and becomes   
a storehous of knowledge.

Dear I,   
I am reminded the replies of Bhagawan to Sri Kavyakanta in context to Sravana  
and Manana where Bhagawan says   
"If one watches whence the notion 'I' arises, the mind is absorbed in that,  
that is Tapas"   
"When you recite a Mantra, watch where the sound is coming from, within you -  
'I', When you sing a song or a prayer, watch where it is emanating from?, your  
heart"   
similarly, if 'I' concentrates where from one is hearing (Sravana) and where  
from one is getting clarity (Thelivu, in tamil) it is all to be found in the  
'I', the Self itself!   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
Very much yes. Thelivu in Tamil, is clarity in mind beyond all   
confusion and delusion. Tirumoolar says: TheLivu TheLivu Guru meni kaandal   
Clarity, Clarity, clarity arose when I saw my Guru.   
Guru darshan erases all confusion and delusion.   
Arunachala Siva.
