The mind-stuff is citta. It is a mental substance.Vrtti or thought-wave is a  
modification of the mind stuff. It is a process. Just as waves and bubbles  
arise from the surface of the ocean, so also these vrttis arise on the surface  
of the mind-ocean.   
Just as the sun's rays emanate from the sun, so also these mental rays  
(modifications of the vrtti), emanate from the mind-sun. Just as the sun  
merges itself into the horizon at sunset, by collecting all its rays, so also  
you have to merge in the sun of suns, absolute consciousness, eternal peace,  
by collecting all the dissipated mental rays and dissolving the mind itself.   
The function of the vrtti in the mind is to cause the removal of the cause of  
ignorance covering objects. Gross ignorance is enveloping all objects. When it  
is removed, then perception of objects becomes possible.   
Through its own effort the mind assumes the shape of any object, and  
concentrates upon itself. When the mind thinks of Brahman, the sole ultimate  
thought of Brahman is formed. Be vigilant. Watch the mind and its activities.  
The object does not bind you - it is the vrtti, the identification with the  
vrtti, that causes attachment and bondage.   
If you become one with the mind, body and vrttis you get various sorts of  
miseries and sufferings. The whole universe is created by the vrttis alone.If  
these mental thought-waves subside you can attain the absolute state of  
highest peace and bliss. Just as soap cleanses the physical body, even so japa  
(repetition) of any mantra, dhyana (meditation) and kirtan (chanting),  
together with the practice of yama and niyama (discipline), cleanse the mind  
of all impurities. Just as you nourish the physical body with food, even so  
you will have to give food for the mind and spiritual food for the soul.   
Only when the modifications cease do you enter the silence. Realise this.  
Close the eyes, draw in the senses, still the mind, silence the thoughts,  
sharpen the intellect, purify the citta, meditate on Om and chant it with  
feeling. Enter the silence. Silence is Atman, the centre - it is in the heart-  
cave. When the mind runs from one object to another, the state in the  
interval, wherein you become mindless, is Brahman.

Mind is a non existent entity from Atma Swarupa. It has no form.   
The thoughts are emanating from the mind, the I-thought, being the   
first child of the mind.   
Bhagavan Ramana says in Anma Vidya, Verse 2: The thought 'I am the body' is the thread   
On which are strung together various thoughts.   
Questing within enquiring 'Who am I?   
And when this thought?' all other thoughts   
Vanish. And as I, I, within the Heart-Cave   
The Self shines of its own accord.   
Such Self-awareness is the only Heaven,   
This stillness, this abode of Bliss.   
Arunachala Siva.
