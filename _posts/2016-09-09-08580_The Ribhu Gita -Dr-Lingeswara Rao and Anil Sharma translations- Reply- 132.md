48\. The notion of existence of mind is too unreal. The gross body too is  
unreal. The subtle body   
too is unreal -= truly, very truly,. I say in the name of Siva.   
49\. Heaven and hell are unreal. The pleasure thereof is unreal. All  
grasping is unreal. All   
that is grasped is unreal.   
50. That which shines as the truth is unreal, yes untruth I say, in the name of Siva. That which   
is known as present is real. That which is past is unreal.   
51\. That which is known as the future is verily unreal. It is the truth  
the truth. I say this in the name   
of Siva. The beginning is unreal, the middle is unreal, so is the end of this  
world unreal.   
52. Age is always unreal, unreal indeed. There is no doubt of this. Knowledge is ever unreal,   
and so are ignorance and the knowable.   
53\. The universe is always unreal. The inert is always unreal. The seen is  
always unreal. These   
shine like the horns of a horse.   
54. Imagination is always unreal. The products of sheaths are unreal. All mantras are unreal.   
This is the truth, the truth. There is no doubt of this.   
55. Other than the Self there is no world. There is nothing of this non self ever. Any of this other   
than the Self is unreal. There is no doubt that this is truth, the truth.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
