Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Do you know the story of KARALA KATTAI SIDDAR. I think He got immersed in  
Vaidhyanathan temple in chennai poonamali. The sculpter has made His   
figure on one of the pillar. If you have his life story please let us know.   
Thanking you   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
I do not know anything about KARALA KATTAI SIDDHAR.   
He may be one of the lesser known Siddhas.   
Arunachala Siva.

Ajanani"s actions are thoughtfullness whereas Jnani's actions are thoughtless  
actions. In their presence actions (good) all are taken places.   
He does not plan or expect the results. An ordinary person think hundred times  
before doing. But in the end he suffers or others suffer.   
Is it so?

T.S. Eliot has written: There will be time, there will be time,   
There will be decisions, there will be indecisions,   
There will be time,   
When everything looks alike.   
Arunachala Siva.
