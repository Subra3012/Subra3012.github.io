\-- While all this talk was going on, Dr. Srinivasa Rao was   
massaging Bhagavans feet which had some rheumatic trouble.   
Bhagavan humorously remarked, Doctor is now giving diksha   
to me by touch. About 15 days ago, when the Doctor was   
massaging Bhagavans feet, Bhagavan asked him to stop,   
saying, What you have done is enough. You may go and sit   
down. I shall do some massaging myself and get some punya (spiritual merit).   
Why should you alone have all the punya? and began   
massaging himself.   
(Day by Day with Bhagavan p. 27)

Once Viswanatha Swami washed the codpiece of Bhagavan.   
Bhagavan Ramana kept quiet for a day. On the second day,   
He said: Viswanatha, do not wash my codpiece any more. Today   
you give your dhoti and I should wash it and do some seva for you!   
Viswanatha Swami was blushed.   
Today is Viswanatha Swami's Liberation Day. He merged with   
Bhagavan Ramana on this day [moon digit day] in 1979. I thought   
someone write about him, this great devotee, who is the author   
of Sri Ramana Ashottaram and he was also Editor of Mountain Path for some  
time.   
Arunachala Siva.
