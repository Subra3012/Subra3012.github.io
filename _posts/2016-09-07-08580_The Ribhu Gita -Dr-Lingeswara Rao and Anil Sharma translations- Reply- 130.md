31. Air is ever unreal indeed. Even all this is only unreal. Ego and intellect are unreal. The hosts   
of beings in the world are Brahman only.   
32. Thought force is always unreal. 'This' is unreal, there is no doubt. The demons are all unreal.   
The Lord's forms are unreal.   
33\. The universe is always unreal. Hari (Vishnu), is always unreal. Brahman  
is always unreal.   
His creation too is unreal.   
34\. The great Lord is unreal. The chief of hosts is unreal. Again Uma  
(Parvati) is always unreal.   
Skanda and Ganesa are unreal.   
35. The individual Self is always unreal. The body is unreal. The Vedas are always unreal.   
The termination of the body too is unreal.   
36\. The Dharamsastras and the Puranas are only unreal and betray the truth.  
Everything is verily   
unreal. Lineage too is unreal.   
37. All this is unreal from beginning to end. The sages are unreal. The worlds are always unreal   
unreal. All that are seen are also unreal.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
