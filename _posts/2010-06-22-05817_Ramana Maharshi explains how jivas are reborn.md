D: Does not death dissolve the individuality of a person,so that there can be  
no rebirth, just as the rivers discharged into the ocean lose their  
individualities?   
M: **But when the waters evaporate and return as rain on the hills, they once  
more flow in the form of rivers and fall into the ocean; so also the  
individualities during sleep lose their separateness and yet return as  
individuals according to their samskaras or past tendencies.** Even so it is  
in death; and the individuality of the person with samskaras is not lost.   
D: How can that be?   
M: **See how a tree whose branches have been cut, grows again. So long as the  
roots of the tree remain unimpaired, the tree will continue to grow.  
Similarly,the samskaras which have merely sunk into the heart on death, but  
have not perished for that reason,occasion rebirth at the right time; and that  
is how jivas are reborn.**

Dear prasanth,   
Yes. It is these vasanas that cause rebirth, death, and again rebirth   
ad nauseum. The root of these vasanas is ego. Unless the root is   
cut off and when one reaches the ego less state it is liberation.   
Bhagavan Ramana says that even a single vasana would create   
rebirth. There are some Padamalai verses on these aspects: Veerse 1682: Unless the destruction of all vasanas is accomplished,   
it will not be possible even for Iswara to bestow the state of liberation.   
Verse 2301: The felicitous state of immovable peace that never   
falters will be attainable only to those who have destroyed the ancient  
multitude of vasanas, putting an end to all attachment.   
Verse 2497: Pramada [not keeping one's attention on the Self].   
whose association with one is detected in the culminating phase   
of sadhana, is the mind's original, deluding vasana.   
Verse 1098: Achieving Atma Nishta through sadhana is to arrive   
at a life that is free from the misery caused by the scorching vasanas.   
Verse 358: Destroy the worldly vasanas. Sow the vasana of   
Chidakasa [the expanse of Consciousness] in your Heart.   
M.Sivaprakasam Pillai also asked this question: Q: How the ancient, time immemorial vasanas can be destroyed   
and one can be in the state of Swarupam?   
Bhagavan: Do not doubt, whether possible or not possible. If one is ever in  
Swarupa Dhyanam, he will definitely achieve the goal.   
Sri Sankara also says in Vivekachoodamani : Vasana kshyam is   
moksham.   
Arunachala Siva.
