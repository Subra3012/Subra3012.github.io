## skanda Sashti  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 21, 2009, 12:39:51 PM

Skanda Sashti is celebrated after Dipavali, from the first day   
of the waxing moon for six days. These are more the days   
of solemnity, of fasting, of prayers to Skanda. Skanda was   
born from the third eye of Siva. There was no union of Siva   
and Paravati. He is the real Male Child! Skanda killed Surapadma and his two  
brothers on a Sashti day, the sixth day of waxing   
moon in Tula month. The war is mother of all wars, lasting for   
18 years. Skanda was just three years old, when he fought   
Surapadama and brothers.   
Surapadma did a lot of penance for boons from Siva. He is a   
terrific demon, and Ravana and Kumbakarna and Kamsa cannot   
show a candle to him! He took the boons to rule 1008 worlds   
for 108 Yugas, aeons! He was ruling from a place called Veera   
Mahendrapuram in the present Sri Lanka.   
As soon as he got the kingship, he imprisoned Vishnu, Brahma,   
Indra and other gods. Under him, Brahma was the priest for   
his demonic prayers everyday! Indra and Varuna went to the   
oceans to fetch choices fish. Vishnu was the main assistant.   
Surapadma and his two brothers were killed and they became   
the peacock and rooster for Skanda. Mother Parvati gave   
Skanda, the powerful Spear as a weapon.   
Skanda has got as many as 225 temples in India. But six   
temples were his main abodes. These are called 6 barracks   
for him. The number 6 is the number of Skanda.   
He has got 6 faces.   
He has got a 6 lettered mantra, Sa ra va na bha va.   
His main chakra, the meditational drawing has got 6 angles.   
Skandam is the epic of Vyasa that describes Skanda's sports.   
Like Siva, he had no birth and no death. He rose as the Sun   
rose and vanquished the demons and released the gods.   
The Sun never sets.   
A little more information about Skandam.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Consecration of Ascetism  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 19, 2009, 09:03:46 AM

In formal methods, the Guru consecrates the asectism of a disciple.   
There is something called Viraja Homam, where the disciple   
performs his own rituals for his death. This is the death of worldly   
life only. Then the Guru gives a name to the disciple, Swami so and so....  
This is called Diksha Name. Then the Guru gives him,   
in secrecy, a Diksha Mantra. A holy word or phrase to be constantly chanted  
by the disciple even after attaining sannyasa.   
For Ati-varnasrama ascetics like Bhagavan Ramana, there were   
no such things. He had no mantra, excepting the famous Who   
am I? and no name, but for the one given by Kavyakanta Ganapati   
Muni. Bhagavan Ramana embraced asectism on His own accord,   
without any formal rituals. There was no Guru, even though He   
had mentioned Arunachala Himself as His Guru.   
Diksha Name is only naming of the aham-sphurti, the inner-   
completeness. Diksha mantra is only description of this   
inner completeness.   
Rama Tirtha used to say to any one: Rama is the name of your   
Self.   
There are two aspects of a person. Lakshyartam, the goal. This   
is only I AM feeling of any person. But in this world, we give a person, a  
name to specifically identity him. Suppose there is a   
person named Mr. White. If his friend calls: Mr. White, he would   
turn back and see. Here, the White does not mean any colour,   
but the person. But for a Jnani, both are the same. I AM is the   
name. But for worldly purposes, we give names. After the   
maha nirvana of a Jnani, his worldly name and his realization   
become one and the same. He becomes merely a Presence. That   
is why in Advaita and other schools, after internment of the   
Jnani's mortal remains, people keep a Siva Linga or a Tulsi plant   
over the samadhi. No separate identity.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniam,   
Did you mean by  
Quote  
He had no mantra, excepting the famous Who   
am I?  
that this was the closest to what one might call a mantra, that is, not a  
mantra in the usual sense?

Dear Chuck Clff,   
Yes. The question Who am I? was the avyakta mantra for   
Bhagavan Ramana. The hidden mantra within. The death   
experience took about 15 minutes. The mantra had been   
answered. He had no other question to ask. He had no other   
mantra to chant in future. He has given the same mantra to   
Sivaprakasam Pillai in 1901, i.e. after about 5 or 6 years.   
Bhagavan Ramana Himself had said on many occasions that   
I, I, I is the mantra, which is more potent than the HIndu   
Om.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniam, we must have differing opinions on what constitutes a  
mantra, since I come from a western background I assume yours should be the  
more correct.   
Still, the english translation of Sadhu Om's "The path of Sri Ramana.." it is  
Pillai who asks the question: Quote  
The first question asked by Sri Sivaprakasam Pillai   
was, Nan yar? (Who am I?), to which Sri Bhagavan   
replied, Arive nan, which means knowledge alone is I,   
Knowledge itself is I or Knowledge indeed is I, the, Tamil   
word arivu being approximately equivalent to the Sanskrit   
word jnana or the English word knowledge.  
(Appendix I page 181)   
This is followed by the second question: Quote  
Sivaprakasam   
Pillai then asked, What is the nature of (this) knowledge?,   
and Sri Bhagavan answered, Arivin swarupam sat-chitanandam   
(The nature of this knowledge is existenceconsciousness-   
bliss).  
 I'm sorry if this seems argumenative, but I don't want to be confused about  
what seems to be the core of Ramana's teaching.   
Love-Being-Aware

Dear Chuck Cliff,   
I understand your point. Who am I? appears as a question   
and not as a holy word (mantra). The reply is: After negating   
everything, what remains as Real, which is Knowledge, which   
is in the form of Sat-Chit-Ananda, Existence-Knowledge and Bliss.   
Now people may ask that it is a question, which does not have   
any positive answer but only removal of all negative replies.   
Yes. It is true. But this question leads to the Real, the One   
without a second and that is the goal.   
Normally a mantra or a holy word, like Siva, Siva or Rama, Rama   
is constantly repeated to get into the goal. But here, the question   
or the holy word is asked a few times or many times, depending   
upon the maturity of the seeker. The answer which is the goal,   
is Real.   
In the case of Siva, Siva or Rama, Rama, the mantra is repeated   
even after the goal is reached. Sri Tyagraja, a musician and a   
great devotee of Sri Rama, is said to have repeated the mantra   
a hundred million times in his life time. But here, the mantra   
is stopped once the goal is reached.   
I believe that I have made the point somewhat clearer. I am not sure.   
Bhagavan Ramana Himself has said that Who am I? is not a mantra, in the  
ordinary sense of the words.   
Arunachala Siva.

Simplicity is beauty.Simplicity means living moment to moment without the  
shadow of thought which is born out of dead past.Simplicity is not physical,   
it is psychological.

Dear everyone, Beauty is not what you see outside.   
It is within you. There is no name for it. It is   
beyond names and forms.   
Arunachala Siva.
