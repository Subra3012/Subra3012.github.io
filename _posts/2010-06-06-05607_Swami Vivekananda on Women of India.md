1\. THOU seest many stars at night in the sky, but findest them not when the  
sun rises. Canst thou say that there tare no stars, then, in the heaven of  
day? So, O man,because thou beholdest not the Almighty in the days of thy  
ignorance, say not thsft there is no God.   
 **2\. Four blind men went to see an elephant. One touched the leg of the  
elephant, and said, ' The elephant is like a pillar,' The second touched the  
trunk, and said,'The elephant is like a thick stick or club.' The third  
touched the belly, and said, ' The elephant is like a big jar.' The fourth  
touched the ears, and said,' The elephant is like a winnowing basket' Thus  
they began to dispute amongst themselves as to the figure of the elephant. A  
passer-by seeing them thus quarrelling, said,' What is it that you are  
disputing about ? ' They told him everything, and asked him to arbitrate. That  
man said, None of you seen the elephant. The elephant is not like a pillar,  
its legs are like pillars. It is not like a big water-vessel, its belly is  
like a water-vessel. It is not like a winnowing basket, its ears are like  
winnowing baskets. It is not like a thick stick or club, but its proboscis is  
like that. The elephant is the combination of all these.* In the same manner  
those quarrel who have seen one aspect only of the Deity.**   
3\. In a potter's shop there are vessels of different shapes and forms pots,  
jars, dishes, plates, &c. but all are made of one clay. So God is one, but is  
worshipped in different ages and climes under different names and aspects.   
4\. The Master said: 'Everything that exists is God.' The pupil understood it  
literally, but not in the true spirit. While he was passing through a street,  
he met with an elephant. The driver (mdhut) shouted aloud from his high  
place,' Move away, move away ! ' The pupil argued in his mind, * Why should I  
move away ? I am God, so is the elephant also God. What fear has God of  
Himself?' Thinking thus he did not move. At last the elephant took him up by  
his trunk, and dashed him aside. He was Ay.. severely hurt, and going back to  
his Master, he related the whole adventure. The Master said, A11 right, you  
are God. The elephant is God also, but God in the shape of the elephant-driver  
was warning you also from above. Why, did you not pay heed to his warnings ? '   
5.The human body is like a boiling pot, and the mind and the senses are like  
water, rice or potato, &c.in it. Put the pot with its ingredients on the fire  
; it will be so hot as to" burn your finger when you touch it. But the heat  
does not belong to the pot, nor anything contained in it, but is in the fire.  
So it is the fire of Brahman in man that causes the mind and. the senses to  
perform their functions, and when that fire ceases to act, the senses ] also,  
or the organs, stop.   
The swan, can separate the milk from water; it drinks only the milk, leaving  
the water untouched. Other birds cannot do so. Similarly God is intimately  
mixed up with Maya ordinary men cannot see Him separately from Maya., Only  
the Paramahamsa (the great soul here is a punon the word c hamsa/ which means  
both soul and swan) throws off Maya, and takes up God only.   
A perfect man is like a lotus-leaf in the water or like a mud-fish in the  
marsh. Neither of these is polluted by the element in which it lives.   
Ornaments cannot be made of pure gold. Some alloy must be mixed with it. A man  
totally devoid of Maya will not survive more than twenty-one days. So long as  
the man has body, he must have some Maya, however small it may be, to carry on  
the functions of the body.   
So long as no child is born to her, the newly-married girl remains deeply  
absorbed in her domestic duties. But no sooner is a son born, than she leaves  
off all her household concerns, and no longer finds any pleasure in them. On  
the contrary, she fondles the newborn baby the livelong day, and kisses it  
with intense joy. Thus man, in his state of ignorance, performs all sorts of  
worldly works, but no sooner does he see the Almighty, than he finds no longer  
any relish in them. On the contrary, his happiness now consists only in  
serving the Deity and doing His works   
alone.   
Little children play with dolls in a room apart just as they like, but as soon  
as their mother comes in they throw aside the dolls and run to her crying,  
'Mamma, Mamma ! " You also are now playing in this world deeply absorbed with  
the dolls of wealth, honour, and fame, and I have no fear or anxiety. But if  
you once see the Divine Mother entering in, you will not find pleasure any  
more in wealth, honour, and fame. Leaving off all these you will run to Her.   
A true devotee who has drunk deep of the Divine Love is like a veritable  
drunkard, and, as such, cannot always observe the rules of propriety.   
 **Sugar and sand may be mixed together, but the ant rejects the sand and goes  
off with the sugar-grain ; so pious men sift the good from the bad.**   
He is truly a pious man who is dead even in this life,i,e. whose passions and  
desires have been all destroyed as in a dead body.   
A spring cushion is squeezed down when one sits upon it, but it soon resumes  
its original shape when the pressure is removed. So it is with worldly men.  
They are full of religious sentiments, so long as they hear religious talks ;  
but no sooner do they enter into the daily routine of the world, than they  
forget all those high and noble thoughts, and become as impure as before.   
This world is like a stage, where men perform many parts under various  
disguises. They do not like to take off the mask, unless they have played for  
some time. Let them play for a while, and then they will leave off the mask of  
their own accord.   
What you wish others to do, do yourself.   
There are two Egos in man, one ripe and the other unripe. The ripe Ego  
thinks,Nothing is mine ; whatever I see, or feel, or hear, nay, even this body  
is not mine, I am always free and eternal.' The unripe Ego, on the  
contrary,thinks,' This is my house, my room, my child, my wife, my body, &c.'   
The sun can give heat and light to the whole world,but it can do nothing when  
the clouds are in the sky and shut out its rays. Similarly, sokmg as egoism is  
in the soul,God cannot shine upon the heart.   
Once upon a time conceit entered the heart of the Divine Sage Nirada, and he  
thought there was no greater devotee than fyimself. Reading his heart, the  
Lord Sir! Vishmi said, Narada, go to such and such a place, there is a great  
Bhakta of mine there, and cultivate his acquaintance,' Narada went there and  
found an agriculturist, who rose early in the morning, pronounced the name of  
Hari only once, and taking his plough went out to till the ground all day  
long. At night he went to bed after pronouncing the name of Hari once more.  
Narada said within himself,   
'* How can this rustic be called a lover of God ? I see him busily engaged in  
worldly duties, and he has no signs of a pious man in him.' Narada then went  
back to the Lord and said all he thought of his new acquaintance. The Lord  
said, 'N&rada, take this cup full of oil, go round this city and come back  
with it, but beware lest a drop of it fall to the ground.' Narada did as he  
was told, and on his return he was asked, 'Well, Narada, how often did you  
remember me in your walk?' Not once, my Lord replied Narada, 'and how could I  
when I had to watch this cup brimming over with oil?' The Lord then said, e  
This one cup of oil did so divert your attention that even, you did forget me  
altogether, but look to that rustic who, carrying the heavy load of a family,  
still remembers me, twice every day.'   
The heavier scale of a balance goes down while the lighter one rises up.  
Similarly he who is weighed down with too many cares and anxieties of the  
world, goes down to the world, while he who has less cares rises up towards  
the Kingdom of Heaven.   
So long as one does not become simple like a child,one does not get Divine  
illumination. Forget all the worldly knowledge that thou hast acquired, and  
become as ignorant I about it as a child, and then thou wilt get the knowledge  
of I the True.   
It is very pleasant to scratch a ringworm, but the after-sensation is very  
'painful and intolerable; so the pleasures of the world are very pleasant in  
the beginning but their after-consequences are very terrible to contemplate.   
Where is God? How can we get to Him?   
A. There are pearls in the sea, you must dive deep again and again until you  
get the pearls. So there is God in the world, but you should persevere to see  
Him.   
He who would learn to swim must attempt swimming for some days. No one can  
venture to swim in the sea after a single day's practice. So if you want to  
swim in the sea of Brahman, you must make many ineffectual attempts at first,  
before you can successfully swim therein.   
When does a man get his salvation? When his egoism dies.   
 **The truly devotional and spiritual practice suited for this Iron-age (Kali-  
yuga) is the constant repetition of the name of the Lord of Love.**   
In what condition of the mind does God-vision take place ? God is seen when  
the mind is tranquil. When the mental sea is agitated by the wind of desires,  
it cannot reflect God, and then God-vision is impossible.

Without awakening one's own inner consciousness, one cannot realize the All-  
pervading Consciousness. The inner consciousness must be awakened through  
God's grace.

Disciples

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Swami Vivekananda on Women of India

**THE WOMEN OF INDIA (Detroit Free Press, March 25, 1894)   
Volume 3, Reports in American Newspapers  
Swami ViveKananda lectured at the Unitarian Church last night on "The Women of  
India, Past, Medieval and the Present." H **e stated that in India the woman  
was the visible manifestation of God and that her whole life was given up to  
the thought that she was a mother, and to be a perfect mother she must be  
chaste.** No mother in India ever abandoned her offspring, he said, and defied  
any one to prove the contrary. **The girls of India would die if they, like  
American girls, were obliged to expose half their bodies to the vulgar gaze of  
young men.** He desired that India be judged from the standard of that country  
and not from this.   
(Tribune, April 1, 1894)   
 **BURNINGS COMPARED**   
 _The Hindu widow went to her death agony amid feasting and song, arrayed in  
her costliest garments and believing for the most part that such an act meant  
the glories of Paradise for herself and family. She was worshipped as a martyr  
and her name was enshrined among the family records.   
However horrible the rite appears to us, it is a bright picture compared to  
the burning of the Christian witch who, considered a guilty thing from the  
first, was thrown in a stifling dungeon, tortured cruelly to extort  
confession, subjected to an infamous trial, dragged amid jeering to the stake  
and consoled amid her sufferings by the bystander's comfort that the burning  
of her body was but the symbol for hell's everlasting fires, in which her soul  
would suffer even greater torment._

Regardless of what Swami Vivekananda had said, the women were/are   
treated badly in India. The times are changing slowly. The   
treatment meted out to widows, childhood widows particularly   
bad and needed correction. Women were treated like cattle by   
men, till late 20th century. They were considered as machines for   
sex. India was/ is still a male chauvanestic society. To say   
that women were treated as goddesses in the past, is 100 miles   
away from truth.   
Arunachala Siva.
