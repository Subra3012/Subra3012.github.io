## The Elections are coming!

Now that Elections are coming in India, we should also talk about   
these elections, either in lighter vein or seriously. Even during   
Bhagavan Ramana's time, the freedom movement had reached   
a peak, and many devotees inside the Hall and outside were heatedly   
discussing about freedom movement. Many devotees like Ramanatha Brahmachari,  
went for Salt March in Vedaranyam. Bhagavan Ramana was keeping His immense  
silence, the silence that passeth understanding!   
I think we can all talk a bit about elections to be held in India.   
The first news that struck me was that of Lallu Prasad Yadav.   
He said in a meeting: "This time, it will be difficult to find funds for   
elections. The big bags are talking about global meltdown and   
recession and their coat pockets may not be deep this time!"   
Now we can understand who is running the elections? Is it politicians, their  
policies, or what good they have or have not done   
for the people? It is the coat pockets!   
A friend told me on the other day: The biggest miracle of this elections  
would that the elections are completed and one govt   
is installed! I also think the same way.   
Arunachala Siva.

One basic flaw in Democracy is that everybody is a King! Everybody cannot be a  
King! This is why our Shastras did not have this type of concept of democracy!  
Also democracy has limited the possibilities of our country having a great  
Leader. We dont have a single LEADER i our country. But Gandhi, Lal Bahadur,  
Bose, Nehru etc.. were self made Not Democracy made. Today if one Leader has  
to be formed, its based on only Votes.   
Its again because of Democracy, current great leaders like Manmohan Singh and  
AB Vajpayee had to struggle. They have/had a bigger burden to maintain the  
alliance than to run the country!   
Democracy has a lot of other advantages, no denying to this point!   
Democracy has led us not to a point where no single party is able to win a  
majority. Its going to be a multi party Government this time as well. Its  
flawed. Abdul Kalam also expressed an idea about having 2 party system like  
the Americas. We need to explore ideas. Current system is invisibly flawed.   
Democracy is only money power, not knowledge power, not vote power!   
Probably, Indian politics would have matured when rival parties come together  
to form an alliance for the common goals they share - To have a better India!

Today I read one more news item. The Home Ministry officials have   
asked the IPL Cricket match authorities to postpone the matches since the  
dates are clashing with election dates. Thank god, the officials have not  
asked the Chief Election Commissioner, to postpone the elections! Thank God,  
India is a democracy!

Lallu Prasad Yadav says (after the break of seat sharing arrangements): Congress will learn a lesson!   
Congress says (after the Varun Gandhi episode): BJP will learn a lesson!   
BJP says: (on the Third front): The Communists will learn a lesson.   
When people would say: All of you guys, will learn a lesson!

Talking about Elections and the Money Power.   
Come this elections and find total expenses of all the political parties  
amount to 8000 Crores!   
Is there any difference between the Satyam fraud of 8000 crores and Election  
expenses of 8000 crores?   
What can we do? They spend 8000 crores for us to vote!! rater buy our votes!!!   
Utter Nonsense. I have least bit of respect to all the politicians !!!!  
Useless goons of the Nations!! this 8000 crores can help lift poverty!!  
Education system can be improved!! Its **ABSURD**   
If an honest persons wills to contest the elections what can he do? where from  
he can get money?

The politicians don't hold the solution to our human problems, as you all  
know.   
Let us focus on ourselves, and what we are doing, and leave the circus to  
them.

Mr. Matthew used the word 'circus'. I like this word. Sanjay   
Dutt has been barred from contesting, because he has been   
convicted! We are losing a Prime Minister, who is in mid-50s   
to guide our nation! What a shame on democracy! He would,   
if elected and become prime minister, would give us all a free   
AK 47 rifle with no need for licence. And bullets stocks as   
and when required. We have all lost a golden chance.   
Arunachala Siva.

I really wish and hope that India becomes a Spiritual Super Power and not a  
Nuclear Super Power. I wish that Golden age comes very soon! Yes this Politics  
is a circus no doubt about it but as we are still very much part of the  
society and not yet Jnanis. Its like we are in Grihasthashrama, we are bound  
by our duty towards the nation to create a better nation for posterity.   
Vedic Mathematics is bing taught in Russia, USA, UK, Singapore and many other  
countries but here in India how many will even be aware of Mathematics?   
Chess originated here in India, But in Russia, Its made a compulsory module in  
School.   
Indian culture is very well recognised abroad in USA, UK and many European  
countries and the ideals of Vedic life is being taught well here Its being  
discouraged!   
Where are moral values being taught here in Schools? in UK tender has been  
sent to some premuim institutions like Ramakrishna, Satya Sai, Chinmaya etc..  
to run educational institutions in their country!   
How much of of our Indian History is being taught in schools? The greatest  
epics Ramayana Mahabharatha are they included in school? If a child knows the  
story of Harishchandra He will learn the importance of Satyam or Truth and  
will imbibe the qualitie of the Vedanta.   
We dont have any dearth of Spiritual Gurus with Wisdome and foresight here.  
Just to illustrate Sri Sri Ravishankar has addressed more than 100 parliaments  
and other political gathering in more than 100 countries but he has not  
addressed the Indian Parliement as yet! Such is the State in India.   
Its like the Kabir Doha   
Kasturi Kundali Base Mrig Dunde Banmaahi   
Aise Ghati Ghati Ram Hai Duniya Dekhe Naahi   
Like how the Kasturi deer goes in search of fragrence of itself, likewise the  
whole world (India) is in vein search of God(Prosperity) all over

## Re:[12]Nostradamus Predictions  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: April 02, 2009, 01:14:22 PM  
---  
EVERYONE in the West, from statesman to crossing-sweeper, is aware of the fame  
of NOSTRADAMUS, the French-Jewish seer who died more than 400 years ago. The  
reason for his extraordinary popularity is quite simple. Many predictions  
published by Nostradamus in 1555 have been completely vindicated by the  
passage of time. Writing more than 400 years ago, he not only foresaw the two  
World Wars of the 20th century, but also came close to mentioning Hitler by  
name!   
Quatrain 75, Century X   
Long awaited, he will not take birth in Europe, India will produce the  
immortal ruler, Seeing wisdom and power of unlimited scope, Asia will bow  
before this conquering scholar.   
Quatrain 96, Century X   
The religion of the name of the seas triumphs. This prophecy need a little  
explication. In geography, one finds the Hindu Maha Sagar (the Indian Ocean in  
English). Hinduism is the only religion with a sea (an ocean, rather) named  
after it.   
Quatrain 50, Century L   
From the peninsula where three seas meet, Comes the ruler to whom Thursday is  
holy, His wisdom and might all nations will greet, To oppose him in Asia will  
be folly. South India is the only peninsula in the entire globe where three  
seas meet a point and stretch away.   
The great Hindu leader will hence be a south Indian who offers worship on  
Thursdays. It is easy to see why Nostradamus specifically mentions Thursday as  
the holy day. It is only Hindus who consider Thursday sacred.   
He will bind Asia together under his rule. He however, will not be a tyrant.  
But he will win over the communists by persuading them of the timeless  
varieties of Hinduism. Russia will become India's ally   
The seer's forecast seems to suggest that Russia will be the first among  
Communist countries to abandon Marxism in favour of Hinduism. The Red comrades  
in our midst will doubtless throw up their hands in horror at the mere idea.  
But Riencourt, the French writer, quotes a prophecy made by Ramakrishna  
Parmahamsa shortly before his death which strongly supports the French seer's  
prediction. Shri Ramakrishna declared that his next birth would be to the  
north-west of India. In other words, he will be reborn in Russia as a Hindu  
holy man!

Nostardamus wrote his quartains in cryptic language, may be Latin/   
Hebrew combination. His sayings have been interpreted by many   
scholars and since many are ambiguous, these cannot be said to   
be certainty. There is a chair in US (I think it is Syracuse) university,   
where studies are still going on.   
The nation of the seas may also directly refer to Hinduism, since it is  
derived from the word Indus, which means Sindhu, an ocean.   
Thursday may mean a Guru, it could even be Bhagavan Ramana.   
Sri Ramakrishna would not have had a re-birth at all, in my opinion.   
Only SRK and Bhagavan Ramana are two Indian Gurus who are   
known world wide, from Alaska to Australia.   
All said and done, Nostardamus is a mystery, like South Indian   
Nadi Sastra, where the past and future (including past birth and   
next birth) of every individual, regardless of caste and religion   
has been said in cryptic language in Tamil, in palmyra leaves. Once, when we  
went to Vaitheeswaran Kovil, we checked for Nadi, (a palmyra leaves) for me!  
My mother badly wanted to see. I was skeptic about it. It turned out to be  
true almost 99% It says,   
my name is a name of Skanda, my father's is the name of Dasrata   
Kumara, (Raman!), my mother is a 'blessed lady', (Bagyalakshmi!),   
my be wife will be 'a song', (Geetha!) and I would have so   
many sisters! When the sisters count was not correct, the old   
man said, "As on date, you will have only that number of sisters!".   
One sister had died by then, out of the total number! He even said   
I am the only son! I will have only one son! And I shall leave the job  
sufficiently early in life, before the appointed year! Simply mind   
boggling! But, others have told me that many things had not come true! One  
Westerner was waiting for that old man for his Nadi on   
that day. He had brought a tape recorder!   
One friend of mine, had spent fortunes in lottery tickets since he had been  
told he would get a windfall from lottery! As Bhagavan   
Ramana said everything, including pursuit of Self enquiry is destined!   
Better not to see, like I stopped seeing horoscopes some years back.   
I was good at it, and many in the office were coming to me.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Even my uncles and parents also have seen this Nadi Astrology and I have the  
same thing to share what you have mentioned. Somehow I stopped myself from  
seeing it. I have also been successful. Something stopped me from jumping into  
it?   
I feel Nadi Astrology is 100% accurate on Past details but the future  
predictions seem little skeptical to me. It is said that the fate a person  
keeps changing every minute. When we do Giri Pradakshina we burn all our Past  
Karmas but new ones are born there after depending on our actions. Also a very  
saintly person once told us don't believe Astrology, It is wrong, signifying  
that God's will is the ultimate authority. There are several instances in my  
family when events turned out to be opposite in spite of the Horoscope reading  
because of Faith towards God and sincere prayer or Shraddhai.   
But this whole bit seems very exciting. A Japanese visitor once came to see  
Nadi Astrologer and he was told that he would die at age 53 or so. He got very  
panicky. I hope all is well with that gentleman. But amazingly the Nadi  
Astrologer was able to tell his name, Parents and Brothers and sisters and  
other details....
