Verse 5: விண்ணி னார்மதி சூடிய வேந்தனை   
எண்ணி நாமங்க ளோதி யெழுத்தஞ்சுங்   
கண்ணி னாற்கழல் காண்பிட மேதெனில்   
புண்ணி யன்புக லூருமென் நெஞ்சுமே.   
Fixing the thoughts on the King who adorned his head with a crescent moon that  
shines in the sky, uttering his names, of we consider his Mantram consisting  
of five letters, if one asks which is the place where we can a vision of his  
feet, they are Pukalūr belonging to Siva who is the embodiment all good  
actions, and my heart.   
Arunachala Siva.
