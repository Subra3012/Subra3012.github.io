pratibha-patil_100384666.html   
Coimbatore, June 23 (IANS) The history of Tamil is Indias pride and  
respecting other religions is the Tamilian culture, said President Pratibha  
Patil as she inaugurated the World Classical Tamil Conference here Wednesday.   
Speaking in the decked-up town around 510 km from Chennai, the president  
pointed out that Tamil was accorded the status of a classical language in 2004  
due to its role as a carrier of great culture, not just because of its age and  
richness.   
The Tamil people have enriched cultural richness of the world and India, she  
told the thousands of delegates from India and abroad gathered for the five-  
day event.   
She said the Tamil community fought for Indias freedom from British rule,  
with Tamil poets like Subramania Bharathiar and Bharathi Dasan penning poems  
that evoked patriotism among the people.   
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi said Tamil was not only an  
international language, it is like a mother for all the languages of the  
world.   
This World Classical Tamil Conference is different from the previous eight  
conferences. The three words  World, Classical and Tamil  not only contain a  
depth of meaning but also describe the conference, he said.   
Tamil Nadu Governor Surjit Singh Barnala and Deputy Chief Minister M.K. Stalin  
also spoke on the occasion.   
Earlier, President Patil gave away the Kalaignar M. Karunanidhi Classical  
Tamil Award to Finnish Tamil scholar Asko Parpola.

Anything which comes from the heart it is glorified. When it is coming from  
the mind it is horrified. Even any language.   
All tamil saints, sages and siddhas expressed their bhakti through this  
language so it is rich, cultural and has depth.   
But when this is used for power it becomes like butcher's knief.it becomes  
MOZHI VERI AND MADHA VERI then it looses its richness.

Ramanaduli garu,   
i admire tamilians a lot.   
Tamilians in general are hard-workers and amazing.   
There are lot of brilliant scientists, great mathematicans and also great  
people in field of sports and movies as well.   
Even i remember that ramana maharshi once told tamil is Lord Shiva's Language.   
One amazing thing is even muslims from tamil nadu speaks only tamil .   
I have seen even srilankan muslims also speak only in tamil and not in urdu or  
other local language.   
It is strange and amazing but happens only in tamil nadu.   
Come to andhra pradesh where we fight with each other like telangana issue etc  
etc. ..   
I have seen few tamil collegues of mine who does not even want to move from  
tamil nadu.

Indeed there is no doubt it. It is said, Lord Murga is pleased to hear tamil  
poem where He asked one tamil poetess/saint to praise the devotees in tamil.  
Even Arunagiri when He sang Uma forgot herself and let Her son Muruga to come  
down to give darshan to the public. The first sidhha Agasthya wrote the tamil  
grammer. It is equalent to Latin and sanskrit. But people are misusing. All 64  
leelas are played by Lord siva in Madurai where there was a Tamil sangam. When  
u listen any tamil Padhigam (Padhayalu) sung by Nayanmars or Azhwar tears will  
simply fall down. Surprisingly the telugu people who never speak tamil but  
they sing Thruppavai in tamil. Anybody truely study tamil, they will become  
advaitee at the end. There are so many books, palm leaves writen by sages  
still not come out. Lord Shiva asked Sekizhar to write periyapuranam and He  
gave the first line Ullakaellam....There is no end.All tamil devotees know  
this.

Dear prasanth, Ramanaduli,   
Tamizh is less old only to Sanskrit among the Proto-Aryan and   
Proto-Dravidian languages. Here Aryan means only Sanskrit and   
not Brahmins, which is not a direct meaning. Dravidam means only   
Tamizh and not the people living in south of Vindhayas (purported   
to be driven out by Aryans of Gangetic plains, it is all political   
interpretations). In fact there were many Brahmins among Tamils   
also. So to call Tamizhs as those in South India who are not Brahmins, is a  
travesty of truth. Sanskrit and Tamizh are considered   
the two eyes of Siva by poets.   
The tragedy today is Tamizh is considered to be the sole property of DMK and  
ADMK guys, most of whom cannot even pronounce "zha" which is quite unique in  
Tamizh. Malayalam took it after 1000 years. Again, Tamizh society were/are  
not anti Brahmins or anti   
Sanskrit as brought out by politicians of Tamil Nadu today. There were  
Brahmins in Tamil Nadu who were proficient in Sanskrit and   
Tamizh right from Sangam period. Tolkappiyar was a Brahmin.   
Tiruvalluvar was a Brahmin. In fact, Tamizh has borrowed many   
words from Sanskrit and used them as they are or got them modified a little.  
The first verse of Tirukural mentions four Sanskrit words, Akaram, Adhi,  
Bhagavan and Ulahu ( a modification of lokam in Sanskrit). Tamizh has got a  
hoary past and it had no enmity towards Sanskrit. Tiru Jnana Sambandhar was a  
Brahmin. He wrote Tamizh which these people cannot even read properly. If  
one   
Dravidian (!) politician could read the first verse of ULLadu Narapdu,   
without any mistake, I shall withdraw from this Forum!   
I can write many more things. But Bhagavan has willed it that   
I should not write any new posts. That is why I have not even   
continued ULLadu Narpadu, beyond Verse 29. Otherwise the glory   
and contamination today of Tamizh can be written in 10 posts.   
Not for the present.....   
Arunachala Siva.

Interesting info Subramanian Garu.   
Yes you are right only politicans for their power are misusing the power of  
language.   
But unfortunately there were some moments in the past for anti-hindi and anti-  
brahmanism in tamil nadu.   
One Example: Anti-Brahmanism vs. Anti-Brahmin   
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periyar_E._V._Ramasamy#Anti-Brahmanism_vs._Anti-  
Brahmin   
Opposition to Hindi   
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periyar_E._V._Ramasamy#Opposition_to_Hindi   
But thankfully now there are no more these type of events and it is alright in  
tamil nadu.

Dear prasanth,   
Anti-brahminism still continues even today in Tamil Nadu. It was   
originally whipped up by anti-Hindi agitation, in 1965, but it continued  
throughout the DMK/ADMK regime and continues. In Tamil Nadu, it is very very  
difficult for brahmin boys and girls to get admission into government  
colleges. Moneyed brahmins no doubt give huge donation and if money comes,  
the politicians forget about the caste and give admissions. Thanks to bank  
industry and IT industry, brahmin boys have got some relief. These industries  
take only the merit into consideration, and the bright front ranking brahmin  
boys get the jobs. But today even in IIT and IIM, the scheduled quota of  
admissions have come into vogue. But bright brahmins boys with good marks can  
still make it.   
Next comes the temples. Certain temples which were autonomous   
and which were managing their own affairs, like Chidambaram Temple, has since  
been taken over by the government, with a chief   
executive officer of IAS cadre to look after the affairs.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
It is a shock to know about your discontinuation of new posts. I request you  
to proceed further. It is a good feast for the spiritual heart and mind to  
read new padigams. Because there is no other person who can explain tamil  
padigams and nayanmars stories. There is no doubt for Bhagavan's grace. It is  
everlasting and for every one. Bhagavan never stops such noble works. Being a  
jnani He wrote many padigam, in tamil, telugu,malaiyalam and sanskrit. I  
wounder how you could have a huge collection of spiritual books and have a  
good knowledge. Being a senior person you may take some rest but do not give  
up writing.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Subramanian Garu,   
I understand you many have some personal problems in sending new messages in  
this forum currently and hope the obstruction gets eradicated by god's grace  
and post new articles again.   
Even my number of new messages per day will gradually decrease to 1-2 new  
posts in a weeks time as i am almost done with all the articles i want to  
share in this forum.   
Thanks once again for allowing me to share few articles in this forum.

Dear prasanth, Ramanaduli,   
It is Bhagavan's Will to stop new posts. I shall continue to write   
responses to other members' posts. What more can I say?
