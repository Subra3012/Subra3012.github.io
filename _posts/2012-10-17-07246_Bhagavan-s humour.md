द्वा सुपर्णा सयुजा सखाया समानं वृक्षंपरिषस्वजाते ।   
तयोरन्यः पिप्पलं स्वाद्वत्त्य नश्नन्नन्योऽभिचाकशीति ॥१॥   
ऋग्वेद म.1 सू.164 म.20   
dhvA suparNA sayujA sakhAyA samAnam vRukShampariShasvajAthE.   
thayOranyah pippalam svAdvakthya nashnannanyOaBhicAkashIthi. .1..   
RugvEda Mandala 1, sUkthA 164, manthrA 20   
This beautiful verse, occurring in the Rg Veda, enunciates the Eternal Triad -  
jivAthman, Paramatma and Prakriti -   
Two birds (सुपर्णा), eternal friends (सखाया), inseparable (सयुजा), perched  
together on a Tree. The first one enjoys the fruit borne by the tree, while  
the other merely observes in silence."   
The one that enjoys the fruit is jivAtman, the individual soul, while the one  
that observes is paramAthman. They both, inseparable friends that they are,  
are perched on the Peepal Tree, which represents prakRuthi. The one that  
performs Action is the individual soul, the jivAthman. Having acted, it enjoys  
the fruits of the Act. paramAthman merely watches. paramAthman neither  
performs Action nor enjoys subsequently the fruits of the Act.   
This verse brings out the relation between the three components of the Eternal  
Triad. Atman and Paramatman are joined together in a relationship of eternal  
friendship as allegorically stated in the phrase - सयुजा सखाया. While the  
former performs actions and enjoys the fruit of his actions, the later merely  
enjoys in being the Silent Witness to the Acts of Atman. Atman interacts with  
prakRuthi whereas paramAthman remains aloof, merely observing.   
Athman is passive observer, untouched, unaffected. shudDha prajnyA   
ॐ

## Re:[90] The Vedas  
Author: Ravi.N              Date: August 08, 2014, 07:22:34 AM  
---  
**KAnchi mahAswAmi on the vedas-The upangas** continued...   
 **Mimamsa and Adi Sankara**   
Buddhism on the one hand, Nyaya and Mimamsa on the other which were opposed to  
it, and Sankhya which does not accept Isvara but respects the pramanas of the  
Vedas: of these our Acarya accepts elements that are to be accepted and  
rejects elements that are to be rejected. He establishes the Vedantic system  
which harbours all these and which is their source. Sankara's view is not at  
variance with the ultimate message of Buddhism, that is the exalted state of  
jnana. He accepts some of the basic concepts of Sankhya like Purusa that is  
jnana by itself and equivalent to the Nirguna-Brahman and Prakrti which is the  
same as Maya. At the same time, he accepts the Vedic rituals of Mimamsa and  
the Isvara of Nyaya. But he sees each of them as an aspect of the one Truth,  
not as the final goal which it is to the various individual systems mentioned.  
He integrates these different aspects into a harmonious whole in his own  
system of thought.   
As we have already seen, Udayana and other supporters of the Nyaya system  
criticized Buddhism on the score that it was silent on the question of God,  
while mimamsakas like Kumarilabhatta attacked the same because it did not  
favour Vedic rituals. The acarya was in sympathy with these views and believed  
that Vedic sacraments, considered all-important by the mimamsakas were  
essential to the cleansing of the mind and to the proper conduct of the  
affairs of the community. However, he was opposed to the mimamsakas not only  
because they did not accept an entity like Isvara as the dispenser of the  
fruits of our actions but also because they did not believe that, after being  
rendered pure by works, there is any need for one to go further and take the  
path of jnana. He also did not agree with their view that to become a sanyasin  
giving up all karma is not right.   
Kumarilabhatta and Mandanamisra are particularly important among the  
mimamsakas. The Acarya had a debate with Kumarilabhatta during the last days  
of that mimamsaka and won him over to his viewpoint. Similarly, Mandanamisra  
also became a convert to Advaita Vedanta and came to be one of the Acarya's  
chief disciples assuming the title of Suresvaracarya.   
 **If the Acarya opposed Mimamsa, which is one of the fourteen branches of  
Vedic lore, it was not because he thought it to be wholly unacceptable. He was  
in agreement with the sacraments dealt with in that system, but he differed  
from it on the question of devotion to the Lord. He further believed that the  
fruits yielded by the rites, rewards like paradise, must be dedicated to  
Isvara and that in this very act of renunciation the mind is purified**.  
Sankara's teaching is this: it is only if we realise that Isvara is the Phala-  
data, the one who awards the fruits of our actions, that we will not be  
tempted by petty rewards like paradise. Only then will we be inspired to go  
beyond to attain the higher reward of inner purity. **The Vedic works were  
wholly acceptable to our Acarya. But for the mimamsakas they were an end in  
themselves; they did not transcend them to become devoted to the Supreme  
Godhead and to acquire jnana, the final realisation that Isvara and we are one  
and the same. Sankara criticised mimamsakas for their failure to understand  
this truth**. **That he did not oppose Vedic karma is proved again by the fact  
that in his upadesa (teaching) -it is called Sopana-Panchaka- before giving up  
his body he made the admonishment that the Vedas must be chanted every day and  
that the rites mentioned in them must be performed**.   
 **Vedo nityam adhiyatam   
Taduditam karma svanushtiyatham**   
The Acarya, however, taught us not to stop with karma (performed for the sake  
of karma), but to go beyond it. The rites that we conduct must be made an  
offering to Isvara. This is a means of obtaining inner purity and also that of  
receiving instruction in jnana. That is the time when we must give up all  
karma to meditate upon the teaching we have received, indeed meditate on it  
with intensity and make it our inner experiential reality. **Sankara takes us,  
step by step, in this way to final release. He opposed the mimamsakas because  
they failed to understand the purpose of Vedic karma and refused to go beyond  
it.**   
continued....

द्वा सुपर्णा सयुजा सखाया समानं वृक्षंपरिषस्वजाते ।   
तयोरन्यः पिप्पलं स्वाद्वत्त्य नश्नन्नन्योऽभिचाकशीति ॥१॥

dhvA suparNA sayujA sakhAyA samAnam vRukShampariShasvajAthE.   
thayOranyah pippalam svAdvakthya nashnannanyOaBhicAkashIthi. .1..   
RugvEda Mandala 1, sUkthA 164, manthrA 20   
This beautiful verse, occurring in the Rg Veda, enunciates the Eternal Triad -  
jivAthman, Paramatma and Prakriti -   
Two birds (सुपर्णा), eternal friends (सखाया), inseparable (सयुजा), perched  
together on a Tree. The first one enjoys the fruit borne by the tree, while  
the other merely observes in silence."   
The one that enjoys the fruit is jivAtman, the individual soul, while the one  
that observes is paramAthman. They both, inseparable friends that they are,  
are perched on the Peepal Tree, which represents prakRuthi. The one that  
performs Action is the individual soul, the jivAthman. Having acted, it enjoys  
the fruits of the Act. paramAthman merely watches. paramAthman neither  
performs Action nor enjoys subsequently the fruits of the Act.   
This verse brings out the relation between the three components of the Eternal  
Triad. Atman and Paramatman are joined together in a relationship of eternal  
friendship as allegorically stated in the phrase - सयुजा सखाया. While the  
former performs actions and enjoys the fruit of his actions, the later merely  
enjoys in being the Silent Witness to the Acts of Atman. Atman interacts with  
prakRuthi whereas paramAthman remains aloof, merely observing.   
Athman is passive observer, untouched, unaffected. shudDha prajnyA

**' Eleven Jinping' costs DD anchor her job**

Jinping, mistaking the first name to be the roman letter '11'.   
Especially, if you are a Doordarshan newsreader who has to bid goodbye to her  
job for mispronouncing Chinese President Xi Jinping's name.   
The newsreader mispronounced Xi Jinping's name as 'Eleven' Jinping, mistaking  
the first name to be the roman letter '11'.   
The embarrassing faux pass occurred while reading a news bulletin on Thursday  
evening, The Indian Express reported.   
The regular, experienced newsreaders generally don't prefer working late  
night, when the casual newsreader committed the mistake.   
Quatrz meanwhile quoted a senior Doordarshan official as confirming that the  
newsreader had indeed been let go of

Dear Friends,   
This is something i have just found,searching for something on the net. It was  
written by the one disciple of Osho,Krishna Prem in sannyasnews.org. I find it  
sooooooooo funny!   
**_Being with Osho can be very shocking.   
Basically Osho's first Western sannyasin was given the name Krishna Christ.   
 I was once at the airport flying to India with Krishna Christ,   
when all of a sudden over the public-address system I heard the announcement   
'Krishna Christ you're holding up the flight and your luggage will be off-  
loaded   
 if you don't present yourself at Gate 16.'   
I often wonder how Osho ever got a second sannyasin._**   
I cannot stop laughing. This looks so much like Osho. I just love Him!   
Truly,it is nothing but the Truth. We are all Krishna Christ's.

Bodhidharma sat facing the stone wall. The Second Patriarch of Chinese Câhan  
(Zen), Suika, stood long in the thick snow. Finally, he severed his own arm  
and presented it to Bodhidharma. He said, âYour student cannot pacify his  
mind. You, the First Patriarch, please, give me peace of mind!â The First  
Patriarch replied, _**âBring that mind, I will calm it down!â**_ The  
Second Patriarch said, âI search for it everywhere, but I cannot find it!â  
Bodhidharma replied, _**âI have already pacified it for you!â**_

"Look at the fish swimming about," said Chuang Tzu, "They are really enjoying  
themselves."   
"You are not a fish," replied the friend, "So you can't truly know that they  
are enjoying themselves."

The Zen Master Hakuin was praised by his neighbors as one living pure life. A  
beautiful girl whose parents owned a food store   
lived near him. Suddenly without warning, her parents discovered that the  
beautiful girl was pregnant. This made them very angry.   
The girl would not confess who the father was, but, after much harassment, at  
last named Hakuin!   
The enraged parents went to the Master. 'Is that so?' was all he would say.   
After the child was born, it was brought to Hakuin. By the time, he had lost  
his reputation, which did not trouble him at all, but he took   
very good care of the child. He obtained milk from his neighbors, and  
everything else, the little one needed.   
A year later, the girl- mother could stand it no longer. She told her parents  
the truth -- that the real father of the child was a   
young man who worked in the fish market.   
The parents of the girl at once went to the Master, to ask his forgiveness,   
to apologize at length and to get the child back again.   
Hakuin was willing. In yielding he child, all he said, was, "Is that so?'   
Arunachala Siva.

_**" Donât think that only sitting with the eyes closed is practice. If you  
do think this way, then quickly change your thinking. Steady practice is  
keeping mindful in every posture, whether sitting, walking, standing or lying  
down. When coming out of sitting, donât think that youâre coming out of  
meditation, but that you are only changing postures. If you reflect in this  
way, you will have peace. Wherever you are, you will have this attitude of  
practice with you constantly. You will have a steady awareness within  
yourself."**_

_ **" It is extremely hard to rest undistracted in the nature of mind, even  
for a moment, let alone to self-liberate a single thought or emotion as it  
rises. We often assume that simply because we understand something  
intellectually, - or think we do - we have actually realised it. This is a  
great delusion. It requires the maturity that only years of listening,  
contemplation, reflection, meditation, and sustained practice can ripen."**_

A wise old Zen master, very near death, lay quietly on his mat with his eyes  
closed, all his disciples gathered around. Kneeling closest to him was his  
number one disciple, a longtime practitioner who would succeed the old man as  
head of the monastery. At one point the old master opened his eyes, and  
lovingly gazed at each and every one of his disciples assembled in the crowded  
room. Finally his glance rested on his successor, and he managed to speak his  
last words to the man: ?Ah, my son, you have a very thorough knowledge of the  
teachings and scriptures, and you have shown great discipline in keeping the  
precepts. Your behavior has, in fact, been flawless. Yet there is one more  
thing remaining to be cleared up: you still reek and stink of ?Zen?!?

Dear Sri Graham,   
I wish you a very happy New Year 2010, with continued abundance   
of Bhagavan's Grace. I had been at T'malai from 28th Dec. 2009   
to today, 1st Jan 2010, (upto 2.30 PM). Bhagavan's Jayanti was   
celebrated with joy and happiness, with Ekadasa Rudram and other   
songs. And it is the day of Smt. T.R. Kanakkamal's liberation and   
merger in Bhagavan's lotus feet. I was in the Samadhi Hall, at   
around 9 am., when that devotee had just entered the Samadhi Hall   
and within a minute or so, she merged with Bhagavan Ramana. It is   
Smt. Kanakammal, who has written a separate chapter on Bhagavan's   
humour, in one of her reminscences.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear I,   
Its a sad news at at the same time a good news, that you shared with us. I  
keep reading Smt. Kanakammal's Cherished Memories always, its an outpour of  
her love to he beloved Guru, Sri Ramana Maharshi. And what a perfect ending to  
her body? Its really a great miracle, that she should step inside the Samadhi  
Hall and merge with Sri Ramana Maharshi Himself. I was getting goosebumps as I  
read the news from your post. I was feeling really sad, for a great devotee  
has left this world, more appropriately left the physical memory of her in me.  
But She is ever here, along with Sri Ramana Maharshi.   
She was graced by Nayana Dheeksha from Sri Bhagawan. Its such an extraordinary  
experience to read her experience, right from her young days, when she had an  
intense desire to move to Sri Ramanashramam, how she stayed there, and how she  
had to struggle to convince her father who wanted her to lead a normal life.   
She was so close to Sri Bhagawan and ever is here!   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
Thanks. I think it was Bhagavan Ramana's best Jayanti Gift to   
that great lady. She had learnt Bhagavan Ramana's works from   
Muruganar directly, by attending classes in the Asramam. She   
had no notes with her. Several years later, she put them into   
2 volume book, in nice simple Tamil, covering the complete works   
of Bhagavan Ramana. The English translation of the first volume   
had been recently published. I do not know whether she had completed  
preparation of Volume 2. Once her parents went to   
Kanchi Sri Chandrasekara (Maha Swami) and told him that she   
preferred Sri Ramanasramam than to Kanchi Math. Mahaswami   
had said: "If she is there or here, what difference does it make?   
Both are one and the same." Then Mahaswami smiled at   
Kanakammal and said: Ekanda Vasam, Swayam baham, Anma   
Vicharam, living alone, cooking for herself and self enquiry!   
She did exactly that and got the prize of liberation on Bhagavan's   
Jayanti Day, 2010.   
Arunachala Siva.
