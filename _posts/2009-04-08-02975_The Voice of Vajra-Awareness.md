## The Voice of Vajra-Awareness

Inspired by Skrudai I would like to start this topic based on Mipham Jampel  
Dorjes Text...   
Mipham was an inspired Dzogchen Yogi who lived from 1846-1912, this text is  
designed to clarify doubts and to make available a direct expereince of  
nondual awereness called Rigpa in dzogchen jargon....   
I was fortunate to sit with Keith Dowman who was translator of the text and  
gave a wonderfull 3 day teaching based on the verses....so I do this to deepen  
my understanding and to give access to my understanding of the text...do not  
take it as a real teaching as my understanding of primordial yoga is very  
limited but anyway I hope you get some goods from it....I will more or less  
repeat the teachings of Keith Dowman as much as possible, as he is one of the  
most important western adepts and dzogchen yogis of our times...his root lama  
was dudjom rinpoche whos realisation may be seen on fotographs like the  
following: http://www.bodisatva.org/img/dudjom.jpg   
lets start with the first verse: With the sugatas and bodhisattvas of boundless space and all time,   
embodying primal awareness in the mode of nonduality,   
in the space of sameness wich is Manjusrikumara,   
let there be perfect spontaniety in nonaction.   
this verse verse could be seen as the essence of refuge in dzogchen buddhism,  
here the sugatas (the ones who reached "suchness") bodhisattvas are shown in  
there nondual essence....wich is the space of manjusrikumara (manjusri was the  
heart son of the garab dorje the first and most important dzogchen master who  
brought the teachings form india to tibet)   
so the refuge is not like usual buddha, dharma and sangha...in dzogchen you  
take refuge to the nature of mind...or the great perfection...or to your own  
nondual awereness   
this first verses embody this way of direct refuge....   
the last sentence:  **" let there be perfect spontaneity in nonaction"**   
summerises the actual unteachable dzogchen meditation...it points to the  
nature of this meditation wich is a nonactive meditation, a  
nonmeditation....where the mind is solely fixed on the spontaneusly arising  
moment...not even this, it is not actually "fixed" on the moment....keith  
always said let your mind hang loosely...do not fix it on something....as it  
is indicated here mind is in a state of nonaction....   
another beautiful picture for this nonactive meditation is fuond in  
longchenpas "treasury of natural perfection"..it goes like this: "like an old man basking in the sun" this points to nature of this non  
activity...wich you will find again and again in the scriptures

the next verse is about the indentity of the guru and the importance of guru  
and lineage:  **Through devotion that beholds the glorious teacher, the primordial guide,   
as identical to the sameness of the dharmakaya,   
let the grace of intuition of ultimate meaning move in the heart,   
bestowing the magnificent empowerment of creative gnosis**   
the dzogchen guru is identical to the dharmakaya (the body of thruth) all of  
his movements and words should be seen as expressions of the natural  
perfection and as identical with oneself, as soon as you see the guru outside  
you are on the wrong way....   
again it is stated clearly that the actual dzogchen meditaiton and realisation  
is not "do-able" or fabricated, it is not some technique to gain  
enlightment....it is an intuition, an empowerment that will occur only in the  
presence of an authorized teacher...   
keith dowman also used a very tough example for the nature of the teacher:  chögjam trungpa clearly told the sangha who will be his successor, the  
dharmaholder.   
after his passing away... this man became the dharmaholder, after sometime it  
was known that this man had sex with young boys in the knowledge that he  
himself was HIV positiv...he had aids..   
now there was a split in the community of course on one side the people who  
made a judgement out of there moral conditioning, on the other hand the people  
who saw his behaviour as expression of the nature of mind...   
a very tough example and I want give my own opinion here

and the last verse for today:  **It always abides within us, dependant upon neither exertion   
nor any special faculty or quality-   
through the magic of the teachers precepts   
let us recognise the incredible simple secret of the mind**   
again it is stated that we cannot practice dzogchen meditation, it is not  
something to be "learned" or "understood" we do not need anything special or  
any power to do this, keith said that the natural pefection is our  
birthright...   
it is inborn, so no dzogchen yogi is better then the other or superior to the  
so called "ordinary" person..because it is inborn and not a special new power  
or insight or state....   
the birthright of every beeing even of rocks....maybe one of the biggest  
differences between the expereince of an insect and a human is the experience  
of samsara...our experience of samsara is much more refined much more  
sophisticated, more aspects etc...   
the last two sentences give another very important teaching:  **through the magic of the teachers precepts   
let us recognise the incredible simple secret of the mind**   
on one side the teacher is important to point out the way and "method" of  
dzogchen (a paradox of course) and in the last sentence this paradox finds it  
way into the verse....   
it indicates clearly that we need to recognise it for ourselfes, and that this  
is not a big deal, it is totally simple and easy...it is incredible simple,  
because it is the natural state...not something new or better or superior to  
any other experience or state that our mind makes...

Dear matthias,   
Nice. As the third verse says: "The guru teaches only the nature   
of the mind." Mind is a bundle of thoughts. Mind cannot live on   
its own. It is called Suskhuma Sarira. The mind lives with the   
thoughts. When the nature of the mind is known, half the way to   
self-realization is crossed.   
Arunachala Siva.

yes indeed when the nature of mind is realized the mind is transcended...   
you should note that nature of mind is more or less identical with the "Iam"  
of bhagawan

let us continue with the fourth verse:  **Discursive tought merely increases the neurosis;   
aggressive goal-orientation just causes fatigue;   
and referential meditation locks us tighly in a cage: let all plaguing fixations crumble from within.**   
thi shows clearly the radical approach of genuine dzogchen, keith dowman uses  
this metaphor for it: in dzogchen one is simply thrown into the ocean, the  
view itself does not care if the person can swim or not   
the first line talking about the neurosis superimposed on reality....we want  
to grasp and understand what this moment is, what reality is, but this  
thinking and philospical discurs just covers the natural understanding that is  
inherent in every thinking process...the more we search the self or nature of  
mind in our thoughts the more we are identified with them, the stronger the  
neurosis...   
the next line talks about goal orientation, and is concluded in hte third  
line...to "fight" for the self or realistaion causes fatigue...it can be  
helpfull in the beginning, and the greatest sages show an incredible longing,  
a longing that is far deeper then anything we know...but this longing alone  
will not cause realisation...it is indeed a great hurdle, not to think one  
becomes stuck there for the rest of his life, I guess he//she would commit  
suizide (also a metaphor that is used in the srciptures alot, when one is  
exhausted from the seeking one may attain realisation or die).....   
goal orientation or referential meditation lock in a cage says the third line,  
it is meant that if we sit down to attain enlightment we will fail, as  
enlightment is unattainable, it is no goal, it is the absence of goal and path  
...   
it may dawn if we stop to think enlightment is something we will atain if we  
meditate or do good deeds...   
because this will lock is in a cage, the cage of meditation, as long as  
enlightment is our goal we will not attain it...because attaining is not part  
of enlightment, you cannot become what you are, one cannot create reality, one  
cannot become what he allready is....   
so meditaiotn with a goal, or a reference (a mantra, a picture of god, even if  
you choose your own self as object for the meditation the meditaiton will lock  
you into a cage, because you cannot be the object of your own self....this  
creates a duality where there is non)   
so his advice is the last sentence:  **let all plaguing fixations crumble from within**   
in dzogchen you get a transmission, not unlike shaktipath, you are introduced  
to your true nature, this beeing a nondual awereness flame, that deconstructs  
all wrong notions and in the end deconstructs even itself....   
sounds like atma vichara for me....

Dear matthias,   
The word Saktinipadham, you have used, if I am correct. In all   
sects of Hinduism, the male principle and the female principle   
are always worshipped together. I do not think there is any female   
godhead in any other religion, possibly Jainism which depicts a female   
form, (they call it Saraswati!). The female principle, is the seamless   
conduit which takes the devotee to the male principle. There is no   
Narayana without Lakshmi. She is said to reside in His right chest!   
(Ramana!). It is she who guides the devotee to Narayana. There is   
no Siva without Uma. Uma resides on the entire left side of Siva. It is she  
who guides the devotee to Siva. You may call them really "the   
better half"! What are they? They are the Self and the Grace. Grace is  
always feminine. Even in Christianity, girls are named Grace!   
The Grace of the female principle, is Saktinipadham. There is one   
name in Sri Ramana Ashottaram: Om Maha Sakti Nipatena Prabhuddhaya Namah!  
Salutations to the One who woke up with the grace of Maha Sakti! This Sakti  
Nipadam or grace of Maha Sakti, is "the touch of the untouch", if one can use  
the Zen phraseology.   
Arunachala Siva.

so the power of the lineage or transmission is always the feminin aspect? that  
is an interessting view....   
yes it is true in a way even zin they say "shin" to indicate the realisation  
shin equals heart-mind or better big heart big mind   
big mind beeing presence, unchangeing, ungrasping totally holistic presence  
wheres big heart is also this presence but has the ability to be  
compassionate, it is the active part of presence   
they also say that bigmind is wisdome and big heart is compassion...but one is  
not possible without the other...   
is there also a link here?   
so grace and transmission or saktipath (I do not know the correct sansjrit  
rendering in english, a siddha yoga thing) is the female aspect....the aspect  
of compassion...wheress contemplation is the male atribute...   
please clear my doubts and missunderstandings   
matthias

Dear matthias,   
You are correct. Sakti is the grace of divine power which descends   
on a fit devotee, to guid him to Godhead. She represents heart,   
the seat of compassion, Maha Karuna. God or Siva is Maha Prajna,   
the great Wisdom. Both constitute Sat-Chit-Anandam. It is, yes,   
a Sanskrit word, used more by Saiva Siddhantis. Even Chinese   
have got some twin words, to represent male and female principles.   
In Jainism, Saraswati the goddess confers knowledge to the devotee to place  
him with the Godhead.   
Arunachala Siva.

verse number 5   
Inconcievable, inexpressible, there is nothing to see   
and nothing remaining to be seen;   
with conviction in the nature of mind, the only true meaning,   
let us realize what is so difficult to be shown to us.**   
a wonderfull verse the first two lines say us clearly: you cannot see it,  
there is nothing really! But what are we doing in our meditaiton? we try to  
focus on something (the I-thought for example, or hte feeling of  
beeing)...this is not pure meditation....because we think that the "I-thought"  
or the "beeingness" is a something...an object and we use our willpower to  
concentrate on it...   
so we try to make the subject that sees a something that we can see.   
But actually listen: **Inconcievable, inexpressible, there is nothing to see   
and nothing remaining to be seen;   
so why use willpower to see something when there is nothing to be seen? just  
rest and relaxe into the natural here and now...no concentration, no technique  
neccessary...this is dzogchen..a big AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH and let go into  
what allready is our condition...   
then we need **conviction in the nature of mind** \--> we need to know what  
the "self" is, or the nature of mind in dzogchen terminology....when we have  
understood what it is, when we had first insights and expereinces...when we  
have the knowledge we can relaxe, we know what we search, we know how it  
feels, we know it more and more...and we know that it is EVER PRESENT....so we  
need not look for it and use tonns of psychic energy to "reach" it....quiete  
the contrary is the way: be natural, just relaxe into your own state of mind  
with the knowledge that this state of mind is allready genuine nondual  
awereness...   
everything superimposed over the natural state will melt away.....   
the last sentence is clear I think:  **let us realize what is so difficult to be shown to us.**
