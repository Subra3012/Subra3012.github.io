Atmavichar,   
Right from my childhood days,I have always been fascinated by his deep  
resonant voice and glorious singing of oothukaadu venkata subbier's songs on  
Lord Sri Krishna.Just the other day I was watching the recording of his live  
video:http://www.pithukulimurugadas.com/listen.html with the vibrant  
accompaniment by his wife with the cymbals.Just how devoted she was-she  
married him only to serve him and this can be witnessed in this video,how  
lovingly she feeds him a quick bite amidst his performance.   
'paadavithaay naan paaduginrene'\- is a wonderful song."You made me sing and I  
am singing'.   
Namaskar

Chadaiya Nayanar -   
Date of liberation to Siva's feet - Margazhi, Ardra Star Day.   
Chadaiya Nayanar was the father of the renowned devotee who gave the great  
Tiruth Thondath Thokai   
and considered himself the slave of the slaves of Lord Siva. If we see that  
many admirable qualities of Sundarar like his excellent love for the Lord was  
inherited from his father Chadaiya Nayanar how   
much of praise will be sufficient to say about him ! Tiruk Kural says the duty  
of the father is to make   
the son to be front runner in the assembly of wise. This father has made his  
son celebrated not in a small assembly of people, but to be praised across the  
centuries. That father who had the softer than patal feet of God in him and  
the son was in the God will be remembered with reverence by the true devotees.   
Let the love of Chadaiya Nayanar for the Lord of Love stay in the mind.   
Arunachala Siva.

Friends,   
Warmly recommend this Hanuman Chalisa by the child sooryagayatri: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANk4fmRNyuE   
The Chanting of Hanuman Chalisa has been recommended by all great ones as a  
specific for curing all ills and bestowing Grace.Today is Hanuman Jayanthi as  
per the Tamil calendar.   
Swami Vivekananda always goaded the youth to look upto Lord Hanuman as the  
perfect ideal: You have now to make the character of Mahavira your ideal. See how at the  
command of Ramachandra he crossed the ocean. He had no care for life or death!  
He was a perfect master of his senses and wonderfully sagacious. You have now  
to build your life on his great ideal of personal service. Through that, all  
the other ideals will gradually manifest in life. Obedience to Guru without  
questioning, and strict observance of Brahmacharya - this is the secret of  
success. As on the one hand Hanuman represents the ideal of service, so on the  
other he represents leonine courage, striking the whole world with awe. He has  
not the least hesitation in sacrificing his life for the good of Rama. A  
supreme indifference to everything except the service of Rama, even to the  
attainment of the status of Brahma and Shiva, the great World-Gods! Only the  
carrying out of Shri Rama's best is the one vow of this life! such whole-  
hearted devotion is wanted.   
For a neat transliteration and word for word translation of this wonderful  
Hymn please check here: http://maharajji.com/Hanuman-Chalisa/hanuman-chalisa-transliteration.html   
http://maharajji.com/Hanuman-Chalisa/hanuman-chalisa-word-by-word.html   
Namaskar.

Dear Sri Ravi   
Thanks for sharing the links related to Sri Hanuman Chalisa. Yesterday Only I  
downloaded the text of Sri Hanuman Pancharatnam by Adi Shankara for chanting  
today being Hanuman Jayanthi. The Hanuman Chalisa is also a great Hymn very  
popular in North India and during my visit to Rishikesh, I participate every  
evening in the Ganga Aarathi of Sri Paramath Niketan and this is the first  
Song that is sung there and I hope to include Hanuman Chalisa also in my  
Parayanam today. Thanks for sharing the links.

Chakkiya Naynar: Date of Liberation: Margazhi - Pooradam: The Lord whom the people following all the six religions associated with  
SanAthana dharma reach finally, that Siva had one of the 63 great devotees  
from one other religion, namely Budhdhism (Chakkiyam). The people who seek the  
real truth, whatever be the religion they belong to if they do an impartial  
analysis of Saivism, explore that it is the path of worshipping Siva that is  
ultimate.   
In the place Thiruchchanga Mangai where people had the generous mind like the  
mother earth, Nayanar was born in a family which had agriculture as their  
profession. He learnt lots of philosaphy, not for useless debating or grazing  
to boast as a scholar, but to find out the truth. Hence he had love for all  
the creatures in this world. He was determined to come out of the birth-death  
cycle. (reincarnation). He reached the city Kanchi, which had lots of  
scholars and was synonymous with knowledge, out of his quest for the truth. He  
accepted the path of Buddhism. There he had the opportunity to explore the  
principles of Buddhism and other religions. He read the scriptures of his  
religion and other religions analysed them with unbiased thirst for truth. Our  
Lord always leads people in the correct way if they are truthful and have  
quest for Him. By His grace he established for himself that it is the path of  
Siva that is the ultimate truth.   
He found out, "There are four basic elements. The deed, doer, its effect and  
the controller of the effect. Only Saivam has this excellent principle, and  
others don't. And Siva is the Truth". His conclusion was based on his  
analysis. It was beyond doubts. It was the fact explored. He was sure,  
"Whatever be one's state, whatever be the form and outside appearance the  
right thing to do is not forgetting the holy feet of Sankara. " So he didn't  
change his appearance of a Buddhist monk, but was always enjoying the sweet  
feet of Lord Siva in his heart. It is only the people who do not realize or do  
not wish to realize that Omnipresent Almighty Isha is the God, blaspheme due  
to their dependence on other religions. But our Nayanar flowed in the path of  
love for the God whom he found out to be the right.   
Common for the invisible formlessness and the visible different forms is the  
symbol of the Lord called Sivalingam (symbol of Siva). That stands for both  
form and formless. Sivalingam appeared when Vishnu and four headed brahma  
tried to find out the head and feet of the God. It is the symbol of that  
immeasurable unique in-explainable Almighty. Realizing these concepts he  
everyday went to see the Sivalingam, and when seen he forgot the world, became  
the wax that saw the fire, his heart blossomed, eyes expanded in bliss, tears  
of joy appeared as pearls. He didn't know what to do. He took a stone and  
threw it on the Lord without the knowledge of what he is doing but with great  
devotion. The Lord was happy with the deed of His devotee, like the kid that  
feels good when the elders out of the love violently embrace it. In his  
routine he arrived the next day as well. He then remembered that he had thrown  
a stone on the Lord. Thinking that that happened only as a blessing of the  
Lord he took that as his service to that Easily pleased. That day on wards  
everyday he throws a stone at the Sivalingam and worship the God in the  
saffron cloth of the Buddhist monks.   
Is it right to throw stone on the Lord and worship ? Won't it lead to  
misinterpretations ? How did the Lord then accept such a worship ? It was not  
the stones themselves the Lord accepted. It was the devotion behind that deed  
he accepted. So one can not argue that, "I too will throw stones and call it  
worship". Whether it is the stone throwing of Chakkiya Nayanar or Kannappa  
Nayanar's putting the footwear on the Sivalingam's head, it was not the  
actions but the unimaginable peaks of love that was accepted by the Lord as  
flawless. Others see only the stones, but the hara takes that as flower.   
One day he forgot to do his duty of stone worship and went to have his food.  
That time he realized, "Oh! How did I forget my Love ? How can I go ahead with  
my food without worshipping Him ?". He rushed to the three eyed Lord's abode  
with flood like love and speed. He took a stone and offered it to the feet of  
God. To bless the devotee who forgot his food, rushed in anxiety to do the  
service he undertook without any break, the eight armed sugarcane - Sambu -  
appeared in the horizon on the holy Bull with the Goddess who has the best  
knowledge of the Agamas. The devotee prostrated, praised the Lord with the  
folded hands on his head. God offered him the coveted post of being His slave  
in the Sivaloka. Let the quest for the Absolute and the love that is beyond  
explanation stay in the mind.   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian,   
May I request you to post stories of nayanmars in a separate thread or in the  
rough notebook thread.This thread is to provide news,events,articles,etc that  
devotees can readily refer to.It will help if this sort of organized  
presentation is maintained in a Forum to facilitate this sort of a reference.   
Namaskar

Balaji,   
Yes,truly gifted and the credit should go to her mentor Sri Kuldeep pai who I  
understand frequents talks of Nochur Sri Venkatraman.He sang at one of the  
recent talks in English on Akshara Mana Malai by Sri Venkatraman at Sri  
Ramanasramam.   
There is such a purity and joi de vivre in the singing of little  
sooryagayatri-how easily her voice soars in the high register and at the same  
time full of Bhava and devotion.What a diction to top it all!   
you will also enjoy her excellent rendering of mudakaratha modakam,Bhagyada  
lakshmi baramma and harivarasanam.Pls refer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9FekdPOs1M

Thanks Balaji for sharing the info on the death of Soolamangalam Jeyalakshmi  
and it is a not a normal coincidence but a divine coincidence that she passed  
on the day of Sashti. If today Skanda Sasahti Kavacham and Skanda Guru  
Kavacham are popular then the credit definitely goes to Soolamangalam Sisters  
.

Friends,   
Warmly recommend this wonderful talk on the life of Tapovanam maharaj(guru of  
swami chinmayananda): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LSKOf-EBLg   
Sadhu sangha is one of the best ways to orient ourselves to the spiritual path  
amidst our busy workaday schedules...there is no substitute for such a  
satsangh.   
Swami Tapovanam maharaj's autobiography 'Iswara darshan' is a wonderful  
account. ..it should be available for purchase from Chinmaya Mission.   
Swami Tapovan maharaj's 'Wandering in the Himalayas' is another excellent  
account of how a jivanmukta views his rambles in the himalayas...how  
everything is Brahman alone.   
Warmly recommend these two wonderful books.

Friends,   
Moksha Gita by Swami Sivananda is a simple book that gives an easy grounding  
into the Fundamentals of Advaita Vedanta -the Philosophy and the  
Practice....The Commentary by Swami Krishnananda is quite lucid and easily  
assimilable...There is also a neat glossary at the end.   
This is available as a PDF download: http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/moksha/Moksha_Gita.pdf   
Warmly Recommended.

Death of Rukku, elephant at Arunachaleswarar Temple   
Rukku was brought to Arunachaleswarar Temple at the very young age of 3 years.  
She remained alone and in service at the Temple for 27 years after she had  
been given to the Temple by the Tamil Nadu Government   
Her death is believed to have occurred as a result of injuries sustained when  
she was being walked on her way to her enclosure. While walking through the  
Temple's fifth prakaram a pack of dogs barked and ran towards it. Rukku tried  
to run away and hit a barricade. The mahout and a few others managed to calm  
her and gave her water. After a while, she was taken to her shed. However,  
Rukku panicked when a dog ran towards it. When she tried to run away, she hit  
a tin sheet and sustained multiple injuries.   
Temple authorities engaged a veterinarian, however Rukku died within two hours  
of the accident. 15 days before her 30th birthday   
She was laid to rest near Anjeneyar Temple (Vada Othavadai Street) in the  
afternoon after a team of six veterinarians performed a postmortem.   
A senior forest department official said they had collected samples of vital  
organs for a detailed analysis to ascertain the cause of the death. It will  
take two week to get the report, added the official.   
Hundreds of devotees and residents of Tiruvannamalai paid homage to their  
beloved elephant whom they called Rukku. One of the priests in the temple said  
Rukku was gentle. The sudden death of the elephant disturbs us. We offered  
special prayers.

Today (10th April 2018) is the Aradhanai day of Sadhu Om Swamigal, a great  
disciple of Bagavan Sri Ramana Maharishi. He ia a great example for Guru  
Bakthi and being a gifted poet his Prarthanai slogams and songs on his Guru  
Ramana Maharishi, would melt anyone.s heart. Let us recollect him in our  
memory on this day and pray for his blessings. For those who have not heard  
about him let this brief be useful.   
Sri Sadhu Om (1922 ‒ 1985)   
Sri Sadhu Om, sometimes called Sri Sadhu Om Swamigal by his friends and  
admirers, was a poet, author, and direct disciple of Ramana Maharshi. Other  
direct disciples of Ramana regarded him as an authority on Ramana's teachings,  
and his book on Self-enquiry is often taken as the definitive textbook on that  
practice. He was Muruganar's literary executor and has translated and edited a  
number of works in collaboration with Michael James.   
Biography   
Sri Sadhu Om was born in Thanjavur District in Tamil Nadu, India, in 1922. He  
first heard of Ramana in 1943 when he read Suddhananda Bharati's book Sri  
Ramana Vijayam, a Tamil biography of Ramana. Two years later he went to see  
Ramana for the first time. He later described his arrival: When I entered the hall I wanted to see Bhagavan [Ramana] but I only saw a  
sofa and no one sitting on it. I was surprised to see, however, that everyone  
else was doing namaskarams towards that sofa. When I was hesitating whether to  
do namaskarams, I began to notice the vague outline of a human figure sitting  
on the sofa. At once I prostrated. When I got up, I saw that vague figure  
slowly solidifying and becoming clear. Then only was I able to recognize it as  
Sri Bhagavan.   
Sri Sadhu Om's association with Ramana Maharshi lasted four years from July  
1946 until Ramana's death in April 1950.   
Sri Muruganar, often regarded as Ramana's foremost disciple, designated Sri  
Sadhu Om as his literary executor because, according to David Godman, he was  
the only person who fully understood his works.   
Sadhu Om's Works   
Hard copies of Sadhu Om's writings are published in Tamil and English by  
Arunachala Ramana Book Trust which is located in Tiruvannamalai, India.   
Some of Sadhu Om's writings are published in digital form and distributed free  
by Michael James, his literary collaborator and friend.

and his book on Self-enquiry is often taken as the definitive textbook on that  
practice. He was Muruganar's literary executor and has translated and edited a  
number of works in collaboration with Michael James.   
Biography   
Sri Sadhu Om was born in Thanjavur District in Tamil Nadu, India, in 1922. He  
first heard of Ramana in 1943 when he read Suddhananda Bharati's book Sri  
Ramana Vijayam, a Tamil biography of Ramana. Two years later he went to see  
Ramana for the first time. He later described his arrival: When I entered the hall I wanted to see Bhagavan [Ramana] but I only saw a  
sofa and no one sitting on it. I was surprised to see, however, that everyone  
else was doing namaskarams towards that sofa. When I was hesitating whether to  
do namaskarams, I began to notice the vague outline of a human figure sitting  
on the sofa. At once I prostrated. When I got up, I saw that vague figure  
slowly solidifying and becoming clear. Then only was I able to recognize it as  
Sri Bhagavan.   
Sri Sadhu Om's association with Ramana Maharshi lasted four years from July  
1946 until Ramana's death in April 1950.   
Sri Muruganar, often regarded as Ramana's foremost disciple, designated Sri  
Sadhu Om as his literary executor because, according to David Godman, he was  
the only person who fully understood his works.   
Sadhu Om's Works   
Hard copies of Sadhu Om's writings are published in Tamil and English by  
Arunachala Ramana Book Trust which is located in Tiruvannamalai, India.   
Some of Sadhu Om's writings are published in digital form and distributed free  
by Michael James, his literary collaborator and friend.

Dear Sri Balaji,   
The situation in Europe is very bad. They said on the news that people are  
going away from Paris in big numbers. I have family members in Paris, they're  
frightened. In Italy is even worse. More than 300 died today. In Serbia is  
not so bad right now,but not so good also. No deaths so far,but we expect that  
to change. Our relatives are all over the Europe,and they are expected to come  
in April. That will be big problem for Serbia,since it is small country. We  
have police hours from 8pm till 5am. People older than 65 are not allowed to  
go out at all.   
We can only pray and stay disciplined and responsible.   
P.S. I wish to apologize to all my friends for not coming regularly. It will  
be more than a year that I am in the village,not having good connection here.  
I can read posts,but not being able to post since I can catch signal only in  
one part of the house. Waiting for the spring to get out of the house and  
post more.   
With love and prayers,

Dear Jewell Sir   
People must have a small attestation to show to police, when they are outside.  
Groceries shop -40 minutes queue in the open air to enter to avoid  
stampede.Police control the entry.

Our government is tomorrow morning closing the border completely. 103  
infected,no deaths so far. But they said that the real number is: infected  
officially *10. That should be actual number.   
In Italy 427 deaths today. It is horrible.   
I hope India will learn from the mistakes European countries made.

Dear friends,   
180 infected,one death in Serbia. Citizens younger than 65 are allowed to make  
be around freely only between 5am and 5pm,and it seems that will change to no  
moving at all (police hours), since people are so irresponsible. I truly can't  
understand that kind of irresponsibility. So Manny people will lose their jobs  
because of such people.   
The only measures are the severe ones. Not socializing at all! If you have at  
home older people,mother's,fathers, grandparents,see not to come in contact  
with them. Children are somehow more resistant,but they seem to speed the  
virus very quickly. No coffees,teas, seating with neighbors or friends. It  
seems only staying at home,alone,can stop this spread. I am living alone with  
my grandfather,and because of irresponsibility and stupidity of some people,I  
needed to lock our gate and release his aggressive dog,to keep the neighbors  
out. He is 84 years old and can be easily infected.   
Yesterday,in Italy died 800 people. If the virus speeds through the hospitals,  
medical system breaks down,and it is over. People are left to die alone.   
Sure,I am against panicking,it cannot bring anything good. But being  
responsible and careful is a must!   
Please don't socialize,and stay at home if you can.   
With love,
