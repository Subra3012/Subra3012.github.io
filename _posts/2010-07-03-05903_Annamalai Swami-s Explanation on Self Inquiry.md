Thanks to Subramanianji, I could get hold of Annamalai Swamiji's CD. Here is a  
brief explanation of Self Inquiry by Annamalai Swami: You are a man [or a woman]. .. you have conviction on it. You do not have to  
remind yourself that you are a man [or a woman]. But suppose you start to  
think you are some animal or something, you have to tell yourself that you are  
a man and not an animal. It is like that.   
Again he says : You are not the body or the mind. You are the Self.   
In other words, whenever we think we are body or the mind, we have to remind  
ourselves that we are not the body or the mind, but the Self. This is Self  
inquiry.   
At one stage when the disciple asked "I do not understand", annamalai swami  
says "who does not understand, mind or Self". He replied "Mind" and Annamalai  
Swami says "You are not the mind"   
Same thing everywhere. "I want to do this or do that". .. who wants? "mind",   
"You are not the mind"   
Holding onto the conviction that i am Consciousness [Self]... ignoring mind  
and mental demands is Self inquiry.   
Treating the mind and body as not me. .. that is self inquiry.   
i do not strive for comforts of body or the comforts of mind. mental demands  
need not be pacified. this is self inquiry.   
its mentally rejecting i am the mind or the body until the conviction is  
permanent and as clear as the conviction that i am a man and not an animal.   
just as we never, even unconsciously, take ourselves to be an animal. .. so  
too. .. once we never take ourselves to be body or mind. once we stop  
projecting the states of body or mind onto ourselves. ... then Self inquiry is  
complete.   
as long as there are projections of states of body and mind onto Self, as long  
as we take the state of mind and call it our state. .. self inquiry is to  
practice rejecting / ignoring mind.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear srkudai,   
Very true. Brahmasri Nochur Venkataraman says in his sat-sangh: "Please do not take notes. Do not try to remember everything   
through mental process of memory. Just listen, attentively.   
It will go into your Heart."   
Listening attentively, is Self-attention.   
Arunachala Siva.
