What made the great Sankara to choose only certain deities, namely Siva,  
Vishnu, Surya, Devi, Ganesha and later Skanda.   
What made the later philosophers lik Ramanuja to praise Vishnu.   
Does they exist any doctrine that praise siva alone.   
Does Sankara praise siva as supreme lord.

Dear karthikeyan. M   
Sri Sankara professed the doctrine of Advaita, where Brahman,   
Non dual and formless alone is real. But he knew that this   
would be too tough for commoners to assimilate and so he should   
come down for the sake of devotees, to eulogize bhakti. He wrote   
splendid hymns on Siva in Sivananda Lahari and on Sakti in Sri   
Soundarya Lahari. He wrote commentary on Sri Vishnu Sahasranamam, where  
Vishnu is extolled. He wrote many small   
hymns on Ganesa, Skanda, Rama and Krishna, Lalita, Lakshmi and   
others.   
Sri Ramanuja is basically a doctrine finder. He found qualified   
non dualism, where the seeker should remain with godhead till   
the end of aeon and then merge with the godhead. There is no   
Jeevanmukti concept in qualified non dualism. But he did a great   
error of saying that the qualifed non dual goal is Vishnu. Then   
philosophy and religion got mixed up and created hell.   
Saiva Siddhanta is also a doctrine which is qualfied non dualism,   
where Siva is Brahman. But Saiva Siddhantis accept the concept of jeevan  
mukti and liberation while leaving the body and no waiting till the end of  
aeon.   
For a scientific modern mind, Non dualism is found quite acceptable. Because,  
as Gaudapada said in Maandukya Upanishad Karika, 'we have no quarrel with  
anyone.' Christians and Muslims and Buddhists can also accept a non dual  
Source and call it Jesus Christ or Allah   
and Sunya.   
Arunachala Siva.

One great work of 100 verses is Sivananda Lahari. This composition is   
full of bhakti. While Sri Soundarya Lahari is full of mantras, Sivananda  
Lahari is full of devotion. He has also written Sri   
Dakshinamoorthy Stotram. Both have been praised by Bhagavan   
Ramana. He has chosen about 10 verses and given to devotees   
who wanted best verses. He has written equal Tamil verses of   
Sri Dakshinamoorthy Stotram. He wanted to write a detailed advaita   
exposition on Sri Dakshinamoorthy Stotram, which of course, did not   
take place. Sri Sankara has also written Siva Panchakshara Storam, explaining  
every letter of Namsivaya. He has written in Sivananada   
Lahari: O the god of gods! When I look for the husk of various gods,   
you remain there as only grain in the heap of husk. What more do you want  
about Sankara's praise for Siva. But he himself is Siva, no doubt. But he  
has praised himself as Bhagavan used to sing Himself   
the Ramana Ashottaram!   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks for the posts.   
I did a rough search on the internet on vedas, all the three vedas Rigveda,  
Yajurveda, Samaveda praise God Vishnu.   
My question is that from where does Siva comes, Siva is interpreted as a pure  
form of Vishnu by Sankara but apart from the vedas does Siva emerges  
separately.   
What made me to ask this question is because being a south indian, a tamilian  
and most of the temples in South are of siva.   
Does it means that the vedas which are aryan in orgin are more of Vishnu and  
that being aryan merging to india account siva along side of the vishnu.   
I'm not anti-vishnu but just curious to know why does vedas speak more of  
vishnu.   
You said Sri Ramanuja did a great error of saying that the qualifed non dual  
goal is Vishnu, please can you explain in depth.   
Thanks

Dear karthikeyan. M   
Some of the internet information is full of mistakes. Do not trust   
them. Read books instead. Vedas praise all gods, after first praising   
natural elements, Agni, Vayu, Varuna, Bhoomi, and the Space. Later,   
the Vedas praise all gods. Usually Agni is identified with Siva. Vishnu   
estoerically mean One that is spread out everywhere. As already told,   
Yajur Veda eulogizes Siva in Sri Rudaram.   
Most of the (not all of the) Tamil Nadu temples are Siva's because,   
there were many kings who prayed to Siva. Pandyas, Chozhas, and   
a few Cheras prayed only to Siva. Later Pallavas, Chalukyas and Hoysalas  
prayed to both Vishnu and Siva. Sri Rangam is a classic   
case of Sri Vaishnava Temple. In fact, Skanda or Muruga is the god   
of Tamil Nadu. There are 216 Muruga temples, both big and small in   
Tamil Nadu. Muruga is praised even in old Tamil poetry of 2nd Centrury AD.  
Because Rama and Krishna were born in North India, it does not mean that they  
were Aryan gods and Siva is a Dravidian god. In fact, the Arya Dravida theory  
itslef is a myth. For that matter, the first Avatara of Vishnu, viz., the  
Fish was born in Dravida Desa!   
Sri Ramanuja said that qualified non dualism, that is Brahman is non dual, but  
the individual souls can merge with Brahman, only at the end of the aeon and  
not immediately. Till such time, they should only be serving the godhead. He  
must have stopped with that. Instead he said that Brahman is nondual and till  
such time the final merger takes place, Brahman as Vishnu stays in Vaikuntam  
and the liberated souls should stay there till the end of aeon. This caused  
mix up of philosophy and religion sometime around 11th Century AD. If this is  
so, there cannot be any Jeevanmuktas in Sri Vaishnva concept!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear munagala,   
Yes. Siva is Consciousness. Vishnu is omnipresent. Sankara   
uses the word Vishnu in Atma bodha in the sense that it is   
present everywhere. Like gold in all gold oranments.   
Arunachala Siva.
