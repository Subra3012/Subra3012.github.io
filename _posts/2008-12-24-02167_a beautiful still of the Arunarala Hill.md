this still was taken yesterday not by a man, but by Graham's web-cam service  
'arunachala-live" (many thanks to Graham for it!)

Dear Vladmir,   
Thank for your photograph from webacam. I think this was on the   
evening of 23rd Dec. If you could re-project the photographs of   
11th Dec to 21st Dec., the period for which the light was burning   
on the Hills, we would be equally grateful too. I saw it on 20th   
and 21st evening upto 9 PM, with my eyes, at Tiruvannamalai.   
It was a mind-stopping experience!   
Arunachala Siva.

Thank you - however, the webcam service **arunachala-live.com** is the  
creation of two long-time USA visitor/residents to Tiruvannamalai, I only  
maintain their website for them.   
The archive of images is overwritten automatically every minute throughout the  
day, so only today's images are available from the archive - totally 1412 per  
day.   
I have uploaded 80 new, very clear photographs of Arunachala taken this year  
with a high-resolution digital camera - more to follow. You can see them at: http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/arunachala/arunachala_girivalam.htm

I've had this photo as background on my computer screen for a month or so -- a  
couple of things struck me the other day, one is a chorus from a song written  
years ago: Quote  
"I'd be high on some green mountain, high above the raging sea,   
I'd be blest by salt sea breezes -- Speckled Bird, sing for me!"  
The other is that the halo above the green mountain is looks much like a most  
spectacular display of the elusive and rarely seen, "green glimpse". However,  
the green glimpse is seen only for a brief moment (less than a second) during  
the sunset or -rise -- did I understand correctly that this was seen in  
connection with a moonrise and for a longer period, on consecutive nights?
