The next thing is about Asram books. The first one is Guru Vachaka   
Kovai, English translation and commentary by David Godman. This   
book is priced at Rs 150 in India and is a treasure of meaning and   
references to Bhagavan's life and teachings on many verses. David   
has covered all the verses, with cross references to various Tamil   
books (Siddhanta and poems) and Bhagavan Ramana's works. I   
should say that this great book is very lowly priced even for an Indian  
reader. It is priced at Rs 1200, USD 25 for Western readers. This   
is better than Swaminathan's translation in English because unlike   
Swaminathan's, this book covers ALL the verses. There are numerous   
sub-stories about Bhagavan Ramana. This is in English unlike Sri   
Sadhu Om's commentary which is in classic tough Tamil. The other   
books are two beautiful small biographies of Muruganar and Kavya   
Kanta in Tamil. More exhaustive than Telugu and English versions.   
There is one more nice Tamil book, Sri Ramana Mathuranubhavam,   
giving the reminscences of Desur Akilandamma-Mastan and Balarama   
Reddy. There are numerous small books priced between Rs 10 to Rs 25.   
I could buy only for about Rs 800 totally, with my wife's perusasion   
not buy too many. I also bought the new Calendar and Diary.   
Robert Butler's SRI GURU RAMANA PRASADAM, is expected in Jan 2009.   
Bhagavan Ramana's Jayanti falls on 11th Jan 2009. Those who can   
afford to brave the crowd and the heat of Tiruvannamalai can visit.   
Finally, once again about Maha Deepam. This Light stills your mind.   
It makes you to contemplate more within. This Light makes you   
remain in Peace. This Light brings poetry within you.   
I could meet Mani and Ramanan and some more devotees whom I know.   
I could not meet Graham Boyd. I missed David Godman by a few   
minutes in the book shop.   
The Boundless Ocean of Sat-Chit-Ananda,   
All the worlds are waves in His wings,   
Steady, Deep-delving in the Heart-Cave,   
Ramana with non-vacillating mind, I contemplate   
You in the Heart!   
Arunachala Siva.

## Arunachala Pilgirmage - Dec. 20-22 2008  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: December 23, 2008, 06:19:18 AM

I went to Tiruvannamalai on the early morning of 20th, Saturday,   
and reached the Asram around 9.45 AM. I was allotted a guest   
house in Morvi, M-37. The stay and darshan were excellent regardless   
of the heat and the crowd, which has not fully melted after Maha   
Deepam. The crowd in the Asram was not very thick but was   
definitely more than a normal day. Thr food was as usual very nice.   
The most important thing. The darshan of the Great Light on the Hills!   
We could see the Light right from 6 PM to 9 PM, really "live", without   
the help of webcam or media like TV and newspaper. The Light was   
visible even from my room window, the light that had attracted 20   
lacs people on the Maha Deepam day. The darshan of the Light from   
Seshadri Swami Asram, right in front of Dakshinamoorthy was a   
glorious experience.   
About people. I could meet three noteworthy persons this time.   
The first, one Shian, an Israeli girl in her twenties, who spoke ravishingly   
about Bhagavan Ramana. She had chance to go through Bhagavan   
Ramana's books through her friend about 6 months back. She became   
interested and the fire caught on! She said to me that she is able   
to feel the 'effervescence', (the exact word that she used) in the   
Heart! Like the brimming soda water! She has come with plans to   
stay for three months. She was happy to see us and said she came   
from Jordan to Bombay and from their to Chennai and from Chennai   
to T'malai in a cab. We were talking about Golda Meir, Moshe Dayan   
and the Sinai desert.   
The other is one Srinivas from Hyderabad. He is an IRS, working in   
Secunderabad. He is a great Shirdi Sai Bhakta and he had been to   
Shirdi, where some one had told him about Bhagavan Ramana and   
he decided to come to T'malai and has come. He says that he will   
dwell more and more in Ramana and read his books and visit T'malai   
more often in future.   
The third one is an old Kannada lady from Hoskote, a town near   
Bangalore. Her son Ambarish was working as in charge of Virpakshi   
Cave, had a shoulder knee problem. He has undergone surgery   
in Bangalore and is resting at home. Doctors have told him not   
to work for 3 months. Asram has given the mother adequate   
money for medical treatment and has promised to reinstate the   
son when he gets well in Virpakshi Cave supervision! This lady   
was shedding tears to speak about Bhagavan Ramana and said   
that she keeps His photo at home and read the Kannanda books   
on Bhagavan from the Asram.   
To me, the meanest flower that blooms,   
Can give thoughts that lie too deep for tears!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Vladmir,   
Thank for your photograph from webacam. I think this was on the   
evening of 23rd Dec. If you could re-project the photographs of   
11th Dec to 21st Dec., the period for which the light was burning   
on the Hills, we would be equally grateful too. I saw it on 20th   
and 21st evening upto 9 PM, with my eyes, at Tiruvannamalai.   
It was a mind-stopping experience!   
Arunachala Siva.

Thank you - however, the webcam service **arunachala-live.com** is the  
creation of two long-time USA visitor/residents to Tiruvannamalai, I only  
maintain their website for them.   
The archive of images is overwritten automatically every minute throughout the  
day, so only today's images are available from the archive - totally 1412 per  
day.   
I have uploaded 80 new, very clear photographs of Arunachala taken this year  
with a high-resolution digital camera - more to follow. You can see them at: http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/arunachala/arunachala_girivalam.htm

I've had this photo as background on my computer screen for a month or so -- a  
couple of things struck me the other day, one is a chorus from a song written  
years ago: Quote  
"I'd be high on some green mountain, high above the raging sea,   
I'd be blest by salt sea breezes -- Speckled Bird, sing for me!"  
The other is that the halo above the green mountain is looks much like a most  
spectacular display of the elusive and rarely seen, "green glimpse". However,  
the green glimpse is seen only for a brief moment (less than a second) during  
the sunset or -rise -- did I understand correctly that this was seen in  
connection with a moonrise and for a longer period, on consecutive nights?
