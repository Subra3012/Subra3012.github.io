My name is Greg. I've been studying yoga meditation for years. I am very  
interested in having Satsang with Ramana devotees in Melbourne Australia. I  
dont even know if there are any. If you are out there please get in touch with  
me if you wish to have conversations concerning self enquiry (a subject I find  
fascinating). Thank you for your attention. Greg

## Devotees in London  
Author: Paintbrush          Date: May 06, 2010, 03:00:08 PM

Hi,   
I have rarely visited group meditations, but had a powerful but grounded  
experience with family who attend a weekly session with a teacher in Mauritius  
(Yogi Tambe).   
Are there any groups in London that devotees of Bhagwan attend?   
Thanks   
PB
