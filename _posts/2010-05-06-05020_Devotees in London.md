## Who is afraid of death?

There was a concentration camp and there were prisoners during   
World War II. The prisoners were quite happy, playing cards,   
carrom and chess and laughing and giggling. One journalist came   
to interview them. He became aghast seeing the happy nature   
of the prisoners. He asked them: How come you are all extremely   
joyful. You are going to be executed in a month's time. Are you   
not afraid of the impending death?   
One prisoner looked at the journalist and said: At least our dates   
of execution are known to us in advance. But what about your case?   
You may even be shot dead tomorrow. Why should we worry about   
death at all? It may happen or it may not happen. Either way,   
we don't care. We are happy today. That is all.   
One Sanskrit pandit quoted a sloka from a scripture and said   
that we are not afraid of death because of our ajnana, ignorance.   
Bhagavan Ramana said: "Oye! It is not due to that. It is due   
to the truth that in our intuitive knowledge, we are deathless.   
That is our real state. If this intuitive knowledge becomes, the   
experiential truth, then we shall fully understand that our intuitive   
knowledge is the truth.   
Arunachala Siva.

My name is Greg. I've been studying yoga meditation for years. I am very  
interested in having Satsang with Ramana devotees in Melbourne Australia. I  
dont even know if there are any. If you are out there please get in touch with  
me if you wish to have conversations concerning self enquiry (a subject I find  
fascinating). Thank you for your attention. Greg

## Devotees in London  
Author: Paintbrush          Date: May 06, 2010, 03:00:08 PM

Hi,   
I have rarely visited group meditations, but had a powerful but grounded  
experience with family who attend a weekly session with a teacher in Mauritius  
(Yogi Tambe).   
Are there any groups in London that devotees of Bhagwan attend?   
Thanks   
PB
