## True Bhakthi

What is true bhakthi? Does it come on its own? Or we should cultivate? Does it  
come like a samskara?   
For some people it is like a passion. If so is it good? Then it would not be a  
true bhakthi? Does true bhakthi expect any thing like to mingle with God?   
(All from the mind come up.... )

Dear Ramanaduli,   
No doubt samskara plays a part. But the efforts are also necessary.   
Bhagavan Ramana tells M. Sivaprakasam Pillai: The one who sacrifices himself to the Swarupam inside and remains   
ever as Atma Nishtaparan is a true bhakata. The problem is our lack of  
efforts towards sacrificing our ego to the Swarupam within.   
Sirthuondar and Kannappar only displayed this highest bhakti.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
In the same Who am I?, Bhagavan tells M. Sivaprakasam Pillai: " Whatever burdens are thrown on God, He bears them. Since   
the supreme power of God makes all things move, why should we,   
without submitting ourselves to it, constantly worry with thoughts   
as to what should be done and how and what should not be done   
and how not? We know that the train carries all loads, so after   
getting on it, why should we carry our small luggage on our head,   
to our discomfort, instead of putting it down in the train and feeling at  
ease?"   
This attitude is true bhakti. ELLAM AVAN SEYAL.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji,   
Yes. We should have full surrender and faith on God. It may be lots of  
vasanas, and expecting always good result.   
At starting point first we surrender and put all the things on train and sit.  
Some times the train meet an accident and only our compartment will get  
derailed. It is hard to accept our destiny. All philosophy, atma vicharam will  
drown for some times. It is like snake and ladder game. That shows there is  
lack of true bhakti and surrender.   
To have such type of bhakti, we need His grace.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Bhagavan Ramana has said: Grace is always there. There is no   
niggardliness in Grace. But you should have no niggardliness in   
the vessel that you bring. The vessel means devotion. Our devotion should be  
large enough [or intense enough] to obtain the full   
Grace.   
Arunachala Siva.
