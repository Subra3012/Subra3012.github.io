## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri RamaKrishna suggests How a householder should live in the world  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: April 21, 2010, 09:02:55 AM  
---  
**A householder should take care of his children, but at the same time he  
should think of them as Baby Krishna, or as children of God. Serve your father  
as God, and your mother as Divine Mother.** After realizing God, if a man  
lives with his wife, he has no physical relation with her. Both live like  
Bhaktas or true devotees.   
They talk of spiritual subjects and spend their time in thinking of God and in  
caring for His Bhaktas. They serve God who dwells in all beings. Householder: But, Revered Sir, we do not find any such husbands and wives.   
Ramakrishna: Yes, there are some, but they are very rare. Worldly people do  
not easily recognize them. But in order to live like this both must he  
spiritual. If both enjoy Divine Love, then such a life is possible; otherwise  
there will be no harmony, but discord and trouble between husband and wife.   
_Perhaps the wife will complain, saying: "Why did I marry this man! What  
pleasure does he give me? He simply sits quietly and thinks of God. He is  
losing his mind." A devotee: These are some of the obstacles; but there may be  
others. The children may be disobedient or may be diseased. _   
Then, Revered Sir, what is to be done? Ramakrishna: It is very difficult for a  
householder to practise devotion. There are many obstacles. You all know them  
very well,--disease, sorrow, poverty, disharmony with the wife, disobedience  
and evil tendencies in the children; but there is a way out of it. **One  
should occasionally live in solitude and pray and struggle hard to attain to  
God.**   
A householder: Revered Sir, is it necessary to leave one's home? Ramakrishna: **Not for good; but occasionally when you find opportunity, for a day or two,  
leaving behind responsibility, care and anxiety. But during this time you  
should not mix with worldly people or think of worldly affairs. Either live  
alone, or in the company of some saint or holy man.[p. 77 & 78]**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri RamaKrishna suggests How to recognize a saint

Householder: Revered Sir, how can we know or recognize a saint?   
 **Ramakrishna: He is a saint whose heart, soul, and inner nature have turned  
towards God; he who has renounced woman and wealth. A saint does not look at  
women with the eye of desire; if he comes near a woman, he sees the Divine  
Mother in her and worships her.** His thoughts are always on God and his words  
are of Him.   
He sees God everywhere and knows that by serving others, he serves Him. These  
are some of the outward signs of a saint. **Householder: Revered Sir, is it  
necessary to remain long in solitude? Ramakrishna: Until right discrimination  
is acquired.[p. 77 & 78]**

**Live in the world like a dead leaf. As a dead leaf is carried by the wind  
into a house or on the roadside and has no choice of its own, so let the wind  
of Divine Will blow you wherever it chooses. Now it has placed you in the  
world, be contented. Again when it will carry you to a better place, be  
equally resigned.**   
The Lord has kept you in the world, what can you do? Resign everything to Him,  
even your own dear self; then all trouble will be over. You will see then that  
He is doing everything; everywhere is the will of Rama [**] (God).

Bhagavan: Whatever work is done for the good of others is absolutely free from  
fault.   
 **He who performs good works through love, without seeking results, attains  
to God.** But he who works for name, fame or any other selfish purpose remains  
bound. Further, I may say that you have already become Siddha (perfected).   
Vidyasagar: Sir, how is that?   
Bhagavan: You know that Siddha, or well-boiled potato, becomes soft and  
tender. Have you not become tender-hearted by your compassion for all?   
Vidyasagar: But the paste of Kalai (a kind of pulse) when boiled (Siddha)  
becomes harder. Is it not so? **[Book-learned Pandits like vultures.]**   
Bhagavan, laughing: Yes, but you are not like that. **Mere book-learned  
Pandits (scholars) are hard-hearted. They do good neither to themselves nor to  
others.** They are like vultures who soar high in the sky, but always search  
after carrion-pits. **They may talk about Divine truths, but their minds are  
attached to woman and wealth.**   
Their attachment is to worldly things (Avidya). **Compassion, Devotion  
(Bhakti), Dispassion (Vairagya)--these are the manifestations of Vidya.**   
Vidyasagar was listening to the words of wisdom with whole attention, while  
the eyes of other gentlemen present were fixed upon the blissful face of  
Ramakrishna radiant with Divine glory. [p. 104]   
The Bhagavan continued: The Absolute Brahman is beyond the reach of Vidya  
(knowledge) as well as of Avidya (ignorance), which keeps one away from the  
realization of the Absolute. The absolute Brahman is beyond the reach of Maya,  
while Maya is either Vidya or Avidya. Vidya-Maya and Avidya-Maya both exist in  
this world.   
**As there are knowledge (Jnana) and Devotion (Bhakti), so also there are lust  
and greed for wealth. Good and evil, virtue and vice, are to be found in this  
world of relativity; but Brahman is unaffected by them.** They exist in  
relation to Jiva (individual ego), but cannot touch the Absolute Brahman. [p.  
105]

Subramanian Garu,   
You are right. We can take recent example of Fraud Nityananda for "only book  
learned pandits" category.   
Though he talks some divine truths his mind is attached to women and wealth.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says "bhakti leni jnanam kuntidi" means jnana  
without bhakthi is lame.

There is nothing like a "Book Learned"   
Nithyananda, if you read his books and lectures, you shall see that he is  
saying that liberation is possible through patanjali yoga type of system. We  
know that breath control etc only calms the mind, does not release the person!   
Their main concentration is on mano-laya. prolonged mano-laya will lead only  
to more mano-laya. japa and other methods also, without understanding of Truth  
will not lead to liberation.   
Please see. .. He himself talks of "States of Consciousness"! how can  
consciousness have states?   
Consciousness is Every Free, mind has states!   
This sort of talk shows he knows nothing. .. even the book learning is wrong.  
do we understand this?   
which sampradaya or system are they following? they are clearly not following  
Sankara's sampradaya, coz sankara says consciousness is changeless.. . there  
are no states of consciousness. states are of mind! and then again, he does  
not talk sankara's way either. but he talks some kind of "Advaita". ..  
ultimately he says "all is one"... if u ask him why, he will say he has  
experienced it! There is nothing like an experience of Advaita... Every  
Experience is to be understood as Advaitic.   
there is no special experience which will reveal truth. ..   
truth will reveal that all experiences are experiences of Truth!   
People are trapped coz they do not know Truth abt Advaita. they are taken by  
tehse pseudo intellectuals.   
Love!

Dear prasanth, srkudai,   
I met one Mr. Ashok, in the Asramam during my 19th April - 21st   
April 2010. He is from Kerala, past mid-30s who has been staying   
in Ramanasramam guest house / room rented for the past 9 months.   
He was going to all sorts of places including to Bidadi where N   
was there. He was initially impressed with N. This is the trap   
in which all of us fall. We get flabbergasted by the man's book   
learning. But Ashok did not understand Tamil. N spoke only in   
Tamil and a little of broken Indian English. N said: Go and learn   
Tamil properly and come back. Then only you can understand me   
fully. Ashok left Bidadi and then went to North. He went to Rishikesh and N  
was there. Next day he went to Hardwar and N was there. It is was on that  
day, the news broke out.   
A close friend of N who was in the car, when N and a couple of   
others were travelling, had telephoned to Ashok later (secretly): "Man! All the news must be true. The fellow broke down in the   
car. He was perspiring and nervous. He was restless and was   
talking to all sorts of people through is cell phone. Then, he advised his  
driver to take a return drive to Rishilkesh and he landed   
in Himachal Pradesh."   
The arrest warrant was issued on the day he landed in Himachal   
Pradesh. Through the simcard of one of his assistants, Karnataka   
Police zeroed in at Himachala Pradesh.   
I did not want to write this episode while writing about my visit   
to T'malai. I carefully avoided it. But today, N's name came up   
and I had to write it.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear amiatall,   
 Even if its taken that they use the word consciousness to mean mind, they are still mistaken, coz that means they are consider self realization to be a mental state or mental experience.   
The problem is lack of clarity. they do not understand the truth. .. they are  
speculating it from the scriptures, the little they studied.   
they lack clarity as to what self realization is all about, what pranayama  
does or what japa does. each has its place. .. but they are totally confused  
over that!   
Love!

Robert Adams has said: The word "consciousness" is somewhat confusing. There are   
words like "subconsciousness" and "super-consciousness". The   
devotees are bewildered. Hence AWARENESS is to be used.   
Awareness is only the Self-Reaization. "Consciousness" means   
sometimes mental consciousness. When someone swoons, we   
in the normal parlance, use the words "he has lost consciousness"   
Whereas Awareness is ever there. So long as the mind spreads   
its dust over it, the Awareness is not realized, experienced.   
Arunachala Siva.

to T'malai. I carefully avoided it. But today, N's name came up   
and I had to write it.

Dear amiatall,   
 Even if its taken that they use the word consciousness to mean mind, they are still mistaken, coz that means they are consider self realization to be a mental state or mental experience.   
The problem is lack of clarity. they do not understand the truth. .. they are  
speculating it from the scriptures, the little they studied.   
they lack clarity as to what self realization is all about, what pranayama  
does or what japa does. each has its place. .. but they are totally confused  
over that!   
Love!   
Silence

Robert Adams has said: The word "consciousness" is somewhat confusing. There are   
words like "subconsciousness" and "super-consciousness". The   
devotees are bewildered. Hence AWARENESS is to be used.   
Awareness is only the Self-Reaization. "Consciousness" means   
sometimes mental consciousness. When someone swoons, we   
in the normal parlance, use the words "he has lost consciousness"   
Whereas Awareness is ever there. So long as the mind spreads   
its dust over it, the Awareness is not realized, experienced.
