April 14 1950.   
The silence is favourable for two reasons, as impress of piety for this day,  
also for our peace. **April 14**, a moment of silence, contemplation and  
gratitude.

I was born in March 1946, and whenever I think that Bhagavan,   
has shed the body on 14th April 1950 at 8.47 PM, and why I was not   
born in and about 1916, so that, if my karma willing, I might have   
spent 15 to 20 years of my prime life, with Bhagavan and famous   
personalities like Ramanatha Brahmachari, Echammal and Keerai   
Patti.

Dear Subramanian Garu,   
Today i came to know that you are 64 yrs old.   
Its really amazing seeing your dedication in this age.   
My elder relatives more or less born around 1940s still are not comfortable in  
operating computers :-)   
On behalf of forum we would like to thank you for all the support you have  
given to forum members sir.

April 14 1950.   
The silence is favourable for two reasons, as impress of piety for this day,  
also for our peace. **April 14**, a moment of silence, contemplation and  
gratitude.

I was born in March 1946, and whenever I think that Bhagavan,   
has shed the body on 14th April 1950 at 8.47 PM, and why I was not   
born in and about 1916, so that, if my karma willing, I might have   
spent 15 to 20 years of my prime life, with Bhagavan and famous   
personalities like Ramanatha Brahmachari, Echammal and Keerai   
Patti.

Dear Subramanian Garu,   
Today i came to know that you are 64 yrs old.   
Its really amazing seeing your dedication in this age.   
My elder relatives more or less born around 1940s still are not comfortable in  
operating computers :-)   
On behalf of forum we would like to thank you for all the support you have  
given to forum members sir.

I would add to that, Subramanian you have excellent knowledge, and always take  
the time to reply to questions. The forum would be a little empty without you,  
and the service you do.
