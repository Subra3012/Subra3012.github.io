Michael James in his "Happiness and the Art of Being" sums   
up the verses 5,6 and 7 as under: Our perception of any world is dependent upon our imagining ourself   
to be a body in the world, which in turn, is dependent upon our mind,   
the finite consciousness that imagines itself to be the body. Bhagavan   
Ramana begins Verse 5 by saying that our body is a form composed   
of five sheaths, and that all these five sheaths are therefore included   
in the word 'body.' The Verse 22 of Upadesa Undiyar also describes   
the same idea. These five sheaths or adjuncts appear to obscure   
our natural consciousness of our real Self because, we imagine ourself   
to be one or more of them in each of our three usual states of   
consciousness.   
In Verse 6, He points out the obvious truth that everything that   
we call 'the world' is just a combination of five types of perception,   
which we experience through the medium of our five sense organs.   
However, that which actually experiences these five types of sense   
perception is only our mind. So Bhagavan asks: "Since our mind   
alone cognises the world through these five sense organs, say,   
without our mind, is there any such thing as the world."   
The appearance of any world depends not only upon our body,   
through the five senses of which we perceive it, but also upon   
our mind, which is the consciousness that actually knows it. This   
dependence of the appearance of any world upon our mind, is further   
emphasized by Bhagavan in Verse 7, in which He says, "Though   
the world and our mind rise and subside together, the world shines   
by our mind."   
That reality is our own real self - our essential non dual consciousness of  
our own being, which we always experience as   
"I am". In both waking and dream states, our mind appears along   
with a world, whereas in deep sleep, our mind and all worlds disappear.  
However, in all these three states, we continue to experience as "I am".   
Bhagavan calls this "I am" as the Poonram and PoruL. The Complete   
Substance.   
Just as a rope appears to be a snake without ever ceasing to be   
a rope, so our non dual consciousness "I am" which is the one   
absolute reality, appears as our mind and all the duality experienced   
by our mind without ceasing to be what it really is.   
Bhagavan has said in many conversations: "There is no such thing   
as mind." What does it mean? It is the Self which appears as the   
mind, without ceasing to be the Self. When the mind (appearance   
of snake) is overcome, then there is only the Self - I am (the rope)   
which is Real.   
Arunachala Siva.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Ramana Maharshi recalls incident where he suffered with toothache  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: April 30, 2010, 09:37:23 AM  
---  
**22-11-45 Morning**   
After Bhagavan returned from his morning stroll about 8 a.m., some visitor  
prostrating himself seems to have spilled out his entire stock  a good  
quantity  of snuff. Attendant Krishnaswami noticed it and collected the snuff  
and threw it out.   
This reminded Bhagavan of some incidents in his life.   
He said,Tobacco is a germicide. When I was in Virupakshi Cave, one day I  
suddenly found one tooth gave sharp pain when the cold rice came in contact  
with it and I could eat no more. I stopped eating and thought I would have to  
die of starvation. Vasudeva Sastri was then living with me. He had gone out at  
the time.   
When he returned to the cave I told him of my toothache. He said it was  
nothing and that a little tobacco would cure it, killing the germs. As we had  
no tobacco with us, somebody who had snuff with him gave me a little snuff and  
advised me to press it against the tooth and it gave immediate relief, so much  
so that I was able to eat my next meal. When I examined the tooth there  
appeared to be something like a dot on it. Gradually it became a hole.   
Later on a gentleman who was a District Munsiff at Tirukoilur and visiting me  
came to know of it, and sent a dentist from Madras. The dentist came, stayed  
here three days, charging Rs.300-0-0 for his stay and did nothing substantial,  
except cleaning my teeth, pulling out one tooth and a part of another.

## Part 1 - Devikalottara Translated by T. K. Jayaraman  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: April 30, 2010, 01:44:38 PM  
---  
Devi : 1\. O Lord of all celestial beings! I yearn to know that path of supreme  
wisdom and the code of conduct by adopting which one can get liberation, so  
that all humanity may attain salvation. I request you to enlighten me on them,  
out of your grace.   
Ishwara : 2\. O Queen among women! So that everyone may attain knowledge, I shall  
clearly explain to you today the highest knowledge and the discipline to be  
followed by which   
discerning seekers will attain liberation, which is free from any blemish and  
is difficult to describe.   
3\. O Lady with fair countenance! Understand that one who is not able to  
realise the Truth in his Heart by this knowledge of spiritual wisdom known as  
Kala Jnana, can   
never attain it even by studying countless crores of sastras (scriptures)  
spread out like the sky.   
4\. Therefore cast aside all fears (on following this path) and shed all  
doubts. **Giving up attachment or desire for anything,** be ardent in seeking  
the ultimate knowledge with wholehearted devotion and with a clear mind  
(without any trace of confusion).   
 **5\. Claiming nothing as 'mine', filled with compassion**,giving protection  
to all living beings so that no creature fears you, yearning for liberation,  
absorbed in yoga (union of jiva and Para, fusion of individual self with the  
universal Self),study this work Devikalottara and follow wholeheartedly and  
steadfastly the single path shown therein.   
6-7. If one is to describe the person who can bring under control his mind,  
which is restless and turbulent like a whirlwind, and maintain it in a  
tranquil state, he is verily Brahma (the God that does the creation), Siva  
(the saviour who shows the path to salvation) and Vishnu (the sustainer of the  
world); he is Indra, King of the devas, and Lord Subrahmanya (chief commander  
of all the celestial forces);he is Brihaspati, the guru of all devas; he is a  
supreme yogi, and one who has achieved the result of performing all  
austerities; he is a great scholar (who has mastered all the   
Vedas and sastras), and an outstanding man; he is one who has achieved the  
true spiritual goal.   
8-9. The means by which this mind, which is restless and moves about quicker  
than the wind, can be brought under control, is indeed the means to obtain  
liberation; it indeed is what is good for those who seek the permanent  
Reality; it itself is Pure Consciousness and the state of firmness; moreover,  
it alone is the righteous duty to be followed by discerning aspirants; it  
alone is the pilgrimage to holy waters;   
it alone is charity; it alone is austerities. Know that there is no doubt  
about this.   
 **10\. When the mind moves even a little, that is samsara (worldly bondage);  
when the mind abides firmly and motionlessly (in the state of Self), that is  
mukti (liberation). This is certain.** Therefore know that the wise man must  
hold his mind firm by supreme Self-awareness.   
11\. The happiness attained in this aloneness is the highest,boundless bliss.  
Which learned persons will not revel in that Supreme Reality, in which there  
is absolutely no action? Tell me.   
12\. Being rid of the worldly knowledge, the great hero who has acquired pure  
wisdom, in which there are no sense objects, and which is all pervading and  
without any form,will attain immutable moksha without fail, even though he may  
have no desire to attain liberation.   
13\. The consciousness (chaitanya) associated with the aspect 'am' is called  
Sakti. The universe shines by its light.The entire creation is Sakti's  
sankalpa (thought). **The state (of mind) which is completely devoid of all  
attachment is the pure (wisdom) to be attained.**   
14\. The void which is the infinite and all-encompassing one whole without a  
second, which is just the effulgence of pure wisdom, which is completely  
devoid of visible phenomena and which consists of the aspect 'I' is the seed  
which fructifies as liberation, bestowing salvation by enabling one to unite  
with the Supreme.   
15\. Instead of following this direct path, do not ever contemplate even in  
the least upon chakras (located in six adharas, centres in the body), nadis  
(subtle nerves that produce the ten divine sounds such as Pranava), the  
deities associated with the lotus seats (in the adhara chakras, beginning with  
Vinayaka), the mantraksharas (potent sound syllables for the worship of these  
deities) and the diverse mandala murtis (the God-aspects, starting from those  
controlling the sun, Surya Mandala, the moon, Chandra Mandala, and fire, Agni  
mandala).   
 **16\. Those who seek everlasting liberation need not endeavour to practise  
repetition and countless verse mantras (repeating potent scriptural words or  
texts to gain various ends), and methods of yoga such as breath-control  
(pranayama), breath retention (kumbhaka) and concentration**.   
17\. There is no room for performing puja (worship of deities), namaskaram  
(paying homage like prostration), japa (incantation), dhyana (contemplation)  
and so on. Hear from me that the highest truth acclaimed in the Vedas can be  
known only through jnana; hence, there is absolutely no need to know anything  
outside of oneself.   
 **18\. For those whose minds are constantly expanding, clinging to external  
objects, factors will always arise causing increasing bondage. If the outward-  
wandering mind is turned inwards to stay in its natural state, know that one  
will not undergo any suffering in the world.**   
19\. Unite with that one totality, which is all-pervasive,which has no inside  
or outside, which is bereft of all (concept of) directions such as above,  
below and in between, which assumes all the forms in creation and yet is  
itself formless,which can be known only by itself, and which is self-luminous.   
 **20\. People perform their actions having their own aims in mind, and they  
accordingly reap the consequences of their actions by attaining those aims.  
Therefore do not engage in such actions which are not free from flaws (leading  
to bondage). Turn the attention completely away from external objects and  
concentrate only upon that (the Self) which cannot be seen.**   
21\. In our natural state, actions, cause and result of such actions, and all  
the various other theories propounded (in the scriptures) do not exist. In  
fact, even the diverse world does not exist. As such even the worldly  
individual who is attached to (the various attractions of) the world is also  
nonexistent.   
22\. This entire universe is nothing but the niralamba (the reality which  
exists without any support). Further, it shines being illumined by the  
niralamba. The yogi (with his mind turned inward) merges with this whole one  
by making every object in this world one with it. Know this.   
 **23\. If any person does not meditate on this great allpervading void, which  
is the space of consciousness (chidakasa), he will be a samsari (a worldly  
individual) forever in bondage to worldly attachments, like the silkworm in  
its self made cocoon. Understand this.**   
24\. All living beings, of whatever genus, undergo great misery over and over  
again. Hear from me. In order to avert all this suffering and sorrow, meditate  
on the great void constantly without any break.   
25\. Good actions and good conduct have been prescribed only to guide the  
seeker towards the path of acquiring knowledge. Therefore, giving up even  
salamba yoga in which an object (such as a mantra or a form of God) is  
meditated upon in the mind, stay steadfast in your real state (sahaja  
swarupa), where the outside world is not perceived.   
Note: Actions prescribed include worship of Siva in one's mind as well as  
outside. The various ceremonies prescribed in Agama Sastras for worshipping  
Siva in saguna form in a temple are covered in good conduct.   
26\. One who can destroy all the tattvas (principles) from patalaloka (the  
nethermost world) to Sakti (one of the highest tattvas), which are all  
interdependent, by the arrow of sunyabhava is a man of great valour. He has  
attained supreme wisdom which is beyond matter.   
Note: ln sunyabhava the individual is only aware of his conscious being while  
everything else is like a void (sunya) -- without existence.   
 **27\. The mind, hankering after things of the world, is more restless than a  
monkey. If one controls it from wandering after external things and holds it  
in the void of non-matter one will attain liberation directly.**   
28\. The full Consciousness (purna chit) which is not other than the true  
import of the word 'I', being non-different in all the principles (tattvas)  
and being other than the sense 'I am the body', is the all-pervading Reality.   
29\. This complete wholeness pervades inside and outside all creations like  
ether, merging with them, and is itself formless. Dear, those who are  
submerged in this supreme bliss become that supreme bliss themselves. See, how  
wonderful!   
 **30\. The expanding mind will attain peace, becoming still of its own  
accord, if it is deprived of something to hold on,just as fire gets  
extinguished gradually if not fed with fuel.**   
31\. You must realise that the four states of infatuation,delusion, swoon (due  
to shock) and dreaming, as also sleeping and waking, are all to be dispelled.   
32\. If one meditates that the one Consciousness (chit) is different from the  
prana (life-force), which has subtly attached itself to this gross body, from  
the mind, from the intellect and from the ego, one will become established in  
that Consciousness.   
 **33\. Due to sleep and due to thoughts the mind always loses its sharpness,  
its foolishness increases, and it goes to ruin. Awakening this mind with  
effort, and without allowing it to wander, establish it in the state of Self.  
Persevere in this effort by fixing the mind again and again in its natural  
state.   
34\. When once the mind becomes steady, it should not be disturbed in any way.  
There is no need to think even in the least of anything else, entertaining any  
doubts. Fixing the mind firmly in that state (of Self-awareness), keep it  
still.   
35\. Make the mind, which always clings to some support (attaching itself to  
sense-objects), devoid of all such supports. Making the mind, which is  
restless in clinging to external supports, motionless, do not disturb that  
tranquillity even a little.**   
36\. Meditate on the peerless Self which pervades all the various forms, yet  
remains without any blemish (being unaffected by them), just as ether,  
pervading all the creations made up of the five elements, remains unsullied at  
the time of their dissolution.   
 **37\. When one adopts the practice (sadhana) by means of which one 's mind,  
which is restless like the wind, is made still perpetually, then the purpose  
of taking birth as a human being is fulfilled. That is also the mark of a true  
scholar.**   
38\. Do not practise meditation by fixing the mind on the six adhara chakras,  
the ones that are up or down or in the middle, or anywhere else. Giving up all  
such meditations, make the mind always devoid of any support (either inside or  
outside).   
 **39\. If the mind falls asleep, awaken it. Then if it starts wandering, make  
it quiet. If you reach the state where there is neither sleep nor movement of  
mind, stay still in that, the natural (real) state.**   
40\. The state in which the mind is bereft of any support to cling to, ever  
faultless and pure, and devoid of worldly attachments, is the nature of  
liberation attained through knowledge. Keep this firmly in mind.

remains without any blemish (being unaffected by them), just as ether,  
pervading all the creations made up of the five elements, remains unsullied at  
the time of their dissolution.   
 **37\. When one adopts the practice (sadhana) by means of which one 's mind,  
which is restless like the wind, is made still perpetually, then the purpose  
of taking birth as a human being is fulfilled. That is also the mark of a true  
scholar.**   
38\. Do not practise meditation by fixing the mind on the six adhara chakras,  
the ones that are up or down or in the middle, or anywhere else. Giving up all  
such meditations, make the mind always devoid of any support (either inside or  
outside).   
 **39\. If the mind falls asleep, awaken it. Then if it starts wandering, make  
it quiet. If you reach the state where there is neither sleep nor movement of  
mind, stay still in that, the natural (real) state.**   
40\. The state in which the mind is bereft of any support to cling to, ever  
faultless and pure, and devoid of worldly attachments, is the nature of  
liberation attained through knowledge. Keep this firmly in mind.   
.. To Be Continued

## Final Part - Devikalottara Translated by T. K. Jayaraman  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: April 30, 2010, 01:46:03 PM

41\. Dispelling all attachments completely, and fixing that mind in the Heart  
firmly, persist in your practice always in order to strengthen the awareness,  
which then shines forth with great effulgence and clarity.   
42\. Know that whoever meditates on that supreme void,and becomes established  
in it by virtue of constant practice,will definitely attain the great state  
which is beyond birth and death.   
43\. Gods and goddesses, merits, demerits and their fruits, which are likewise  
anya (other than oneself), objects of attachment and the knowledge of those  
objects â all these will lead one to bondage in mighty samsara.   
 **44\. All objects of attachments are said to be pairs of opposites  
(happiness and misery, good and bad, profit and loss, victory and defeat, and  
so on). When one rises above those pairs of opposites, one realises the  
Supreme. Such a yogi is a jivanmukta, liberated from bondage. On discarding  
the body, he becomes a videhamukta.   
45\. A wise man should not give up the body out of aversion to it. Know that  
when once the prarabdha karma (result of accumulated actions) which was  
responsible for the creation of the body ceases, the bodily burden will  
automatically fall off.**   
46\. The Consciousness which shines as âIâ in the Heartlotus is pure  
(flawless) and perfectly steady (without a trace of movement). By destroying  
the ego, which rises (from that Consciousness), that Consciousness itself  
bestows the supreme joy of liberation. Be sure about it.   
47\. With great devotion meditating constantly that âI am that Siva the form  
of the one Consciousness that is always unsullied by any adjunct,â dispel  
all your attachments.   
48\. Giving up all notions about country, caste, blemishless community, asrama  
(status as a bachelor, family man, ascetic or one who has renounced the world)  
and associated matters, hold on to and practise always meditation upon the  
Self, your own natural state.   
49\. I alone am. No one belongs to me; nor do I belong to anyone else. I can  
see no one who can call me his; neither can I see anyone who is mine. I am all  
alone.   
50\. Know that the person who experiences the firm conviction, âI am the  
Supreme Brahman, I am the Master and Lord of the Universe!â is the real  
mukta (one who has attained liberation), and that the one following  
conflicting paths is in bondage.   
 **51\. The day one is able to see oneself with his inner eye as not the body,  
all his desires vanish, and he experiences perfect peace.**   
52\. He who is described in the scriptures as the unborn and Lord, I am He,  
the Atman (Self), who is forever without form or qualities. There is  
absolutely no doubt about it.   
53\. I am pure Awareness, immaculate, perfectly liberated;and forever present  
everywhere. I am indeterminable. No one can grasp me or leave me. I am free  
from sorrow. I am always brahmamayam (of the nature of Brahman).   
54\. I am the Self which is Consciousness, absolute completeness, deathless  
and self-established, and which is other than this insentient body, limited  
between the top of the head and the sole of the foot, and which, beginning  
with the antahkaranas (the inner instruments such as mind and intellect) is  
bounded by the covering of the skin.   
55\. Thinking, âI am the Lord of all creations, moving or stationary, I  
remain as father, mother and fatherâs father for the universeâ, aspirants  
for mukti contemplate with concentration and ardour only upon Me, who am that  
great turiya state (the substratum of the waking, dream and sleep states).   
56\. I am the one who is worshipped through sacrifices and penances by all  
celestial beings beginning with Brahma (the Creator), the heavenly damsels who  
are themselves sought after, humans, yakshas, gandharvas, nagas and other  
groups of superhuman beings, and also by many others. Know that everyone  
worships only Me.   
57\. By many kinds of rare austerities and charities,everyone worships only  
Me. Know that this vast creation, moving and stationary, and all objects, are  
nothing but Me,   
the Infinite One.   
58\. I am not the gross body, nor am I the subtle body. I am also not the  
causal body. I am the kinsman of the universe. I am the One who is of the  
nature of transcendental knowledge. I am moreover the eternal One, the Lord,  
the taintless One,the One who is devoid of the states (of waking, dream and  
sleep), the One who is devoid of the universe.   
59\. The beginningless Consciousness is unborn, whole and, residing forever in  
its natural home of the Heart-cave, is without form, world or impurity. It is  
beyond comparison and completely unattached. It cannot be comprehended by the  
mind nor can it be seen or felt by the senses.   
60\. Repeatedly see thus: âI am He, the eternal, omnipresent Reality which  
is Brahmanâ. Meditating thus for a long time,whoever abides imperturbably  
will become the Supreme Brahman, thereby attaining immortality.   
61\. Having thus explained the nature of knowledge to enable everyone to  
attain liberation, which is always available, I shall now proceed to describe  
the conduct to be adopted by seekers. Noble Lady, listen to them calmly.   
 **62\. O Queen among women! Know that bathing in holy waters, repeating holy  
names or words (mantras), performing daily homa (sacred offering in specially  
prepared fire),worship, other oblations in lustrous fire, or any other means  
(sadhana) to be followed after great study, are never required for him (the  
earnest aspirant seeking liberation).   
63\. Niyamas (strict rules of conduct such as what to eat,when to eat, how to  
eat, what to wear, where to sit and so on),worship of deities in sacred  
places, nama archanas (worship of deities by reciting sacred names), pitru  
karmas (oblations,etc., carried out for the sake of forefathers to help them  
reach a high state), pilgrimage to holy places which have come forth on earth,  
and observance of great vows, are all not for him (the earnest aspirant), if  
considered deeply.**   
64\. He does not reap the fruit of actions, good or bad. Important dates and  
special observances zealously followed by the world are not for him. Give up  
all actions and all kinds of worldly codes of conduct.   
65\. Renounce completely all religious edicts and disciplines. Since all kinds  
of action result in bondage, give up all action plans, mental conflicts, and  
attachment to oneâs caste duties.   
66\. Even if the aspirant acquires many kinds of supernatural powers and  
magical powers such as visualising what is buried underneath the earth, and  
can demonstrate   
them before the world, he should give up mental attachment to them.   
67\. All these (powers) are only bondages to the individual soul. Further they  
drag one to follow a low path. The supreme joy of liberation does not lie in  
any of them, but only in the Infinite Consciousness.   
68\. One must engage unfailingly in yoga (the practice of Self-abidance) in  
all conditions, without allowing any special event to affect one adversely.  
If, due to doubts, delusion arises in the form of attraction to worship in  
holy places and temples (on account of past practices and vasanas), reject it  
immediately.   
 **69\. Listen to me, Lady! Know that only the wise man who never does  
anything which leads to the destruction of any form of life, such as insects,  
worms, birds or plants, is a person who is seeking true knowledge.   
70\. He (the true aspirant) should not pull out tender roots (of fragrant  
plants, which is often done for worship); he should not even pluck the leaves;  
he should not harm any living thing out of anger; he should not heartlessly  
pluck even flowers.   
71-72. He should worship Lord Siva using only flowers that have fallen  
naturally.** He should not indulge in vile practices such as marana (causing  
destruction through the use of certain mantras) uchadana (driving one out with  
the force of mantras), vidveshana (causing mutual hatred between friends), the  
well known sthambana (freezing oneâs capabilities), causing fever, putting  
into action evil spirits,causing agitation, wrongly taking control of others,  
attracting and infatuating others, and so on. Abandon the worship of stones,  
wooden objects and similar articles.   
73\. Having relinquished the great mudras which are adopted in order to fix  
the mind on the devatas (deities) residing in holy places and temples, and the  
associated   
sacrifices, get rid of the vasanas also which may have accumulated on account  
of such practices in the past, and cling only to the Self, the all-pervading  
real Consciousness.   
74\. Maintain a neutral attitude towards all things; do not get infatuated  
with anything; maintain equanimity whether in happiness or suffering; be the  
same to friends and enemies; treat alike a broken piece of mud pot and a piece  
of gold.   
 **75\. Know that a flawless yogi is one who does not ever allow himself to be  
swayed by desire for the pleasures of the senses, who frees himself at heart  
from mamakara (treating things as âmineâ), who has a steadfast mind, who  
is free from desires and fear, and who always revels in the Self.   
76\. Being unaffected by either praise or slander, treating alike all  
creatures, he should always unfailingly maintain an equality of vision (sama  
drishti), considering all living beings in the world as himself.   
77\. Avoid unnecessary arguments and worldly associations.** Do not create  
misunderstanding among others.Do not join religious bodies well versed in many  
scriptures (sastras). Give up both words of abuse and words of praise.   
78\. Gradually and completely get rid of jealousy, slander,pomp, passion,  
consequent hatred, desire, anger, fear and sorrow.   
79\. If a man is free from all the pairs of opposites and always lives in  
Solitude (established in himself alone), he gains perfect wisdom even while in  
the present body and shines forth with great effulgence.   
80\. Liberation is attained only by knowledge (jnana). By other powers  
(siddhis) such a fruit is unattainable. However, aspirants become enchanted  
with blemishful worldly   
enjoyments and thaumaturgic powers (siddhis) and go after them with desire.   
81\. Know that the pure flawless person will experience that blemishless Lord  
(the Supreme Brahman) and positively attain liberation whether attended by the  
supernatural powers or not.   
82\. The body is a form constituted of the five elements (earth, water, fire,  
air and ether). The one all-pervading Siva is also nicely seated there. Hence  
the entire universe,right from the indivisible all-pervading Sivam (the  
highest and most abstract tattva or principle) to this world, is the form of  
Shankara.   
83-84. My dearest, earnest seekers who see the enlightened one and worship him  
with all the three instruments (mind, speech and body) in unison, offering him  
with heart-melting love, sweet-smelling sandal paste, fruits,flowers, incense,  
good water to bathe, clothes and food, will thus attain liberation. Know that  
those who worship that jnani reap the fruit of his righteous deeds and those  
who slander him reap the result of his sins.   
85\. I have revealed the truth about knowledge and the conduct pertaining  
thereto, as you have asked. This entire path is indeed Kalottara Jnana (the  
knowledge to be revealed at the final stage of maturity). Tell me, O Lady, if  
you want to ask anything more.

## dear sadhaks whats with your body?  
Author: matthias            Date: April 30, 2010, 10:27:04 AM

what I have read is that the idea "iam the body" is the main root of  
suffering.   
but I also witnessed this idea totally perverted or not? I would like to talk  
with you about the fact that there seems to be body for us, and waht this  
means, how is our relationship with it? or are we already beyond body  
conciousness? who knows?   
anyway I think this is a very challenging topic, and we should take some time  
to talk about it, I have some doubts here and maybe they can be cleared.  
besides the doubts I also dont like what I see in some meditators, they seem  
to use meditation to kill the body, make it like a piece of would "totally in  
control"....its horrible to witness. so maybe we can find a way to use the  
body for sadhana instead of torture it till we die?   
hope some people will join me here.   
my first input would be this, if you like try it out.....   
you know this photo of bhagawan: please look at it for some time, first thing you will recognize are his  
incredible eyes of course, they seem to talk with the deepest core of your  
beeing but I would like you to focus on another part of his face.   
please look at the muscles arround his eyes, what do they say? you see how  
relaxed (totally relaxed) they are?   
now recognize his face, its totally realxed.....not the slightest bit of fear  
or personality are in the muscles...can you feel what this means, con you feel  
how your face muscles try to answer what ramanas muscles say?   
now use you awereness to look at your own face, use ramana as a mirror...what  
do you feel, can you feel tension some where?   
switch back and forth betwenn youself and what the face of ramana  
suggests...its like a quiete reminder how it feels to drop the idea "iam the  
body"...   
most meditators run in the exact opposite direction...and complain "why do I  
not feel bliss during my sadhana"?   
I would answer relax you body completely during your meditation and during hte  
day, and tell me how it feels....the mind becomes very silent and the body  
very blissfull..   
I feel like I sometimes put on a harnish, or a whole armor build up from  
muscle tension to face the world....   
to harden this harnish, that your body is like the non-moving, ever-present  
atman...you know....I think this is the wrong direciton...   
my dzogchen teacher said that abidence in the nature of mind (Self) is  
developed through relaxation.   
its a very deep sentence when you think about...but one need to understand  
"relax" in the right way.   
its about relaxation into your true nature, into the inherent perfection of  
htis moment, its relaxation of your energies, your body and thoughts...

Body remains as body for non seekers but it remains an effulgence   
for Jnanis. Bhagavan Ramana said that the body and the world   
would still be there, but all bodies would appear as Arunachala   
Swarupam and all the world would appear as Swarupam. Bhagavan   
Ramana saw the old, dark complexioned, labourers, with sweating   
body and tattered clothes in the Hill, as Arunachala Swarupam.   
This is what the verse 5 of Sri Arunachala Pancharatnam also says.   
Arunachala Siva.

thank you for the replies so far.   
what is interessting for me is: how does it feel to be conciousness "embodied"  
if you like...if this body is god, how does it feel when you actually  
surrender your body to god?   
I guess the "experience" that Iam the self, is some how beyond body  
conciousness, but there is no shortcut for most sadhaks, they have to go  
through the body...not sneak arorund it or jump over it in an fearless act of  
faith...for me I have to be the body in order to let it go...Iam not in hte  
position to simply drop it, or forget it..because I would supress it, and  
ignore it though my mind...and eventually end moving arround like a robot...   
through kum nye (a part of tsa lung, an form of yogic exerices from tibet) and  
dzogchen meditation, my body and the knots and blocked energies seem to loosen  
up, its almost like my body is salt in a glass of water, and through the  
sadhana it slowly melts into the water... but this is something "I" feel  
happening..its part of maya of course, no doubt about it, but its an acutal  
feeling not just an idea. and it feels wonderfull to be here right now, and  
because we talked about bliss, I have to say that experiencing the body is  
blissfull, when the body is not surpressed or ingnored or whatever...its not  
ultimate bliss but a kind of bliss that is naturally given in any wakefull  
moment...and you can feel and measure your happiness with the sensations of  
your body not with the mind...the body "feels" the fruits of your sadhana not  
the head...   
I would like to know if someone can relate to what I say, or if Iam running in  
the wrong direction....could be, I dont know   
sarva mangalam

You are not different from body. You and Body are a Whole.   
Why the difference is perceived? why does the mind want to stick to ideas  
about the body, the 'I'   
Its analysis about body is but itself, its analysis about the eternal I is  
again but itself. You, O entity analysing, rest in peace as the eternal Self,  
as it is, there is nothing to change or understand or become or attain!

dear nagaraj   
your answer is the highest teaching one can recieve, and I have recieved it,  
and you see here Iam still carring a name and doing sadhana   
...why? I dont know   
anyway it is the truth what you say so Iam thankfull for reminding me.   
\   
dear amiatall   
if you drop an concept it will always happen in an instant like everything  
arises spontaniously the concepts will arise and drop dead without someone who  
is in charge of it...it is just happening...   
I think (I dont know) that as long as I percieve myself as matthias and you as  
amiatall I have to practice, its as simple as that...all is in gods hands   
so how is this energy, this "iam" how does it feel, and how does it resonate  
with my body?   
is it a running away from my body if I rest as "iamness" or is it a "sinking"  
or "opening" of my body when I rest as awereness......for me its more an  
sinking deeper into my body...I feel my aliveness, and fromt hat feeling I can  
touch the aliveness of everything...the whole universe....when I run away from  
my body and think Iam contemplating hte "Iam" then Iam contemplating about my  
head   
really it feels like that for me, the energy moves upwards and my head is very  
tense, my chest and neck also...   
I remember the talks, a gentleman said ramana he is experiencing the same  
during sadhana, and he asked what this is..and ramana said its the ego...   
aqnd I gues shtis is a crucial point, because one can alway repeat "Iam the  
self", " all that arises is the self" and still life mostly in the head not in  
the heart

Dear matthias,   
I give below the anecdote taken from an article on Sat Darsanam,   
in the recent issue (April-June 2010) of Mountain Path, the Asramam   
magazine. The anecdote is self revealing: Lord Buddha's directives to his disciples was: "Be light unto yourself."   
King Prasenajit came to see the Buddh. He saw a large number of   
bhikkus bowing to him, saying Buddham saranam gacchami..(I surrender to the  
feet of Buddha). Prasenajit found a contradiction   
in this. He asked the Buddha: "Master! You tell the people, "Be light unto  
yourself". But even after this, when they surrender to you, and touch your  
feet, you do not prevent them. If you say, "Be   
light unto yourself", there is no need to surrender to anybody else*. So why  
should theyn fall at your feet?   
The Buddha, the enlightened laughed and said: "These are not my feet*. They  
are not surrendering to me, because there is nobody inside me* as the ego who  
can claim surrender. The disciples are   
simply surrendering. It is not surrender to me. Since they are not   
fully evolved* yet, they are not capable of simple surrender, without an  
excuse. My feet are just an excuse. I, as a person, do not exist!"   
(* According to my interpretation, these refer to egofull and egoless states  
of a devotee and a Brahma Jnani. For the former there is   
still a body, for later there is neither body, nor ego, no mind, he is   
the Self, the Effulgence., the Light unto Himself..)   
Arunachala Siva.

and you see here Iam still carring a name and doing sadhana   
...why? I dont know   
anyway it is the truth what you say so Iam thankfull for reminding me.   
Dear I,   
What you have raised though is a very thought provoking enquiry. But the only  
thing on can do is to remain at peace with awareness about the awareness of  
"...why? I dont know"   
Just become aware of every reaction the mind has to offer and simply remain  
aware about it. What we try and do is to try adding a little bit of kerosene,  
petrol or diesel,. .. analyse what the mind has got to offer. But you sure  
know that whatever mind perceives and thinks, gets desperate, you are not  
going to get nearer to the truth, for you yourself are verily the Truth  
itself.   
The Mind simply gets impatient.   
Just remain aware. Be aware about all the mind has got to offer and simply  
remain, ignore the calls of mind, just be.   
At most what one can do is to just become aware of the fact of our own  
ignorance. The Mind tries to ascertain itself, but of no avail!   
Be aware, just be   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Quote  
I feel my aliveness, and fromt hat feeling I can touch the aliveness of  
everything...the whole universe....when I run away from my body and think Iam  
contemplating hte "Iam" then Iam contemplating about my head  
This is a good point. Through my liveliness I feel the liveliness of the  
whole.   
I think different people restate this point in different ways. Some like to  
call it "liveliness of the whole" and eliminate "my liveliness" altogether  
either because: \- during meditation the "I" starts fading and there appears to be a single  
continuity of liveliness, or   
\- from words of saints learnt that there is a single continuum of  
consciousness, therefore ignore whatever "I" is felt   
\- actually feel that the liveliness is the actual reality and body is part of  
it   
Quote  
really it feels like that for me, the energy moves upwards and my head is very  
tense, my chest and neck also...  
This is also common in meditation. Energy moves upwards towards the head. The  
tenseness fades if the origin of the energy is the heart space. So even if  
there are sensations in the head, the essential awareness is in the heart  
space. (I hope by energy you mean the energy of consciousness.)   
Two good indications are: \- bliss   
\- anahat (unstruck sound)   
I can also relate to your other descriptions like: Quote  
my body and the knots and blocked energies seem to loosen up,  
if blocked energies are loosened, the gross body consciousness seem to melt in  
the inner body consciousness which is more subtle...to a point that "body  
consciousness" appears to be nearing "consciousness" itself.

no i meant the misstake that one thinks meditaion is "strong conentration"  
then the body energy moves to the head and it is very exhausting ot  
meditate...I made this mistakes for at least 1 year and it is still happening  
from time to time...

so many stories of the self. ..... so little time. ..... lol   
we were taught from birth by our parents and others the story of the self.   
you are david, you are susan, you are the one who did this or did that, you  
are good, you are bad. .. over and over until you said " yes, i am david,   
or i am susan", you BELIEVED the story you were told. this story of the self  
is the main belief thata all other beliefs are only a part of, the story that  
all things are compared to and filtered through. who you really are is what  
is UNCHANGED before and after all the stories of the self come and go,   
awareness itself, truth. you are ALREADY truth, you have only to STOP  
BELIEVING you are not. suffering comes from the minds attempt to avoid the  
truth of who we really are. truth is not a thing. the mind can only concieve  
of things, and so to the mind this nothingness is death, to be avoided at  
all cost. truth is simple and CANNOT be practiced. .. suffering is complex  
and REQUIRES much practice.

yes that was a very straightforward advaita answer.....but Iam wondering if it  
was a neoadvaitic answer or one that is really honest?   
anyway you can use talk like this for any topic of life, but you know what: this truth that you are presenting is still there even if you answer the  
questions that where raised from your own sources of knowledge and experience,  
from your whole organism, wich may be an illusion (I dont know hte scriptures  
say so)...but anyway its much more fun...and ramana maharshi also cooked, you  
see, he showed annamalai swami how to make plaster and encouraged him when he  
feeled depressed (when I udnerstood the stories right, maybe he didnt do this)   
anyway: for luminaries like ramana maharshi there is no development....Not at all.   
even for gautama siddharta was development till he realized, so   
if I tell you now with all my honesty IAM BRAHMAN will you believe me?   
or do I need to say YOU ARE BRAHMAN, will you believe me then without any  
further doubt?   
if yes, then what are you doing here? if you dont believe, then what is with  
the body dear sadhaka?   
after all IAM BRAHMAN is the truth, but it is truthfull to speak from the  
"personal" heart...that would be honest you know, also not a bad thing....   
to make my point more clear: if I ask you: "do you like icecream" and you say "drop your body mind and  
realize the immortal atman within"   
then you know...I would think about talking with you twice, the next  
time...because I allready know what kind of answer will come...   
"you like pizza also?" answer: "you are that!"...   
this is not meant to offend you, you see Iam curious about this, I also dont  
try to steal away your realisation if you are allready awake(how could I?), I  
just ask this simple question...what is with the body dear sadhak?   
may it be virtuous

Neo advaita makes it simple but it is not workable. What Beloved   
Abstract posted is not neo advaita, but simple Ajata Vada. Bhagavan   
Ramana was not realized until He reached 16 and then the advaitic   
realization came through death experience, which lasted for about   
15 to 20 minutes. In fact, for sometime, He was thinking that it was a  
pleasant disease! He says this in Sri Arunachala Ashtakam, Verse 1. The  
feeling of maruL, that is the feeling that it was a pleasant disease,  
disappeared when He 'saw' Arunachala. He says "How   
can I say, I saw. There is no 'seer' but only the non-moving Self.   
If I could not say 'I saw', how can I also say 'I could not see'? Who   
can explain this right from the beginning? You have explained this   
by your state of non-movement?   
We are all the Self. But it takes efforts, a lot of them, to realize that we  
are the Self. We are for long long time struggling with the   
various manifestations of non-Self. The Buddha attained it at the   
age of 50 or so. Bhagavan Ramana attained it at the age of 16.   
The devotional history in Tamil says only Tiru Jnana Sambandha attained at the  
age of 3.   
Well written Beloved Abstract.   
Arunachala Siva.

## dear sadhaks whats with your body?  
Author: matthias            Date: April 30, 2010, 10:27:04 AM

what I have read is that the idea "iam the body" is the main root of  
suffering.   
but I also witnessed this idea totally perverted or not? I would like to talk  
with you about the fact that there seems to be body for us, and waht this  
means, how is our relationship with it? or are we already beyond body  
conciousness? who knows?   
anyway I think this is a very challenging topic, and we should take some time  
to talk about it, I have some doubts here and maybe they can be cleared.  
besides the doubts I also dont like what I see in some meditators, they seem  
to use meditation to kill the body, make it like a piece of would "totally in  
control"....its horrible to witness. so maybe we can find a way to use the  
body for sadhana instead of torture it till we die?   
hope some people will join me here.   
my first input would be this, if you like try it out.....   
you know this photo of bhagawan: please look at it for some time, first thing you will recognize are his  
incredible eyes of course, they seem to talk with the deepest core of your  
beeing but I would like you to focus on another part of his face.   
please look at the muscles arround his eyes, what do they say? you see how  
relaxed (totally relaxed) they are?   
now recognize his face, its totally realxed.....not the slightest bit of fear  
or personality are in the muscles...can you feel what this means, con you feel  
how your face muscles try to answer what ramanas muscles say?   
now use you awereness to look at your own face, use ramana as a mirror...what  
do you feel, can you feel tension some where?   
switch back and forth betwenn youself and what the face of ramana  
suggests...its like a quiete reminder how it feels to drop the idea "iam the  
body"...   
most meditators run in the exact opposite direction...and complain "why do I  
not feel bliss during my sadhana"?   
I would answer relax you body completely during your meditation and during hte  
day, and tell me how it feels....the mind becomes very silent and the body  
very blissfull..   
I feel like I sometimes put on a harnish, or a whole armor build up from  
muscle tension to face the world....   
to harden this harnish, that your body is like the non-moving, ever-present  
atman...you know....I think this is the wrong direciton...   
my dzogchen teacher said that abidence in the nature of mind (Self) is  
developed through relaxation.   
its a very deep sentence when you think about...but one need to understand  
"relax" in the right way.   
its about relaxation into your true nature, into the inherent perfection of  
htis moment, its relaxation of your energies, your body and thoughts...

Body remains as body for non seekers but it remains an effulgence   
for Jnanis. Bhagavan Ramana said that the body and the world   
would still be there, but all bodies would appear as Arunachala   
Swarupam and all the world would appear as Swarupam. Bhagavan   
Ramana saw the old, dark complexioned, labourers, with sweating   
body and tattered clothes in the Hill, as Arunachala Swarupam.   
This is what the verse 5 of Sri Arunachala Pancharatnam also says.   
Arunachala Siva.

thank you for the replies so far.   
what is interessting for me is: how does it feel to be conciousness "embodied"  
if you like...if this body is god, how does it feel when you actually  
surrender your body to god?   
I guess the "experience" that Iam the self, is some how beyond body  
conciousness, but there is no shortcut for most sadhaks, they have to go  
through the body...not sneak arorund it or jump over it in an fearless act of  
faith...for me I have to be the body in order to let it go...Iam not in hte  
position to simply drop it, or forget it..because I would supress it, and  
ignore it though my mind...and eventually end moving arround like a robot...   
through kum nye (a part of tsa lung, an form of yogic exerices from tibet) and  
dzogchen meditation, my body and the knots and blocked energies seem to loosen  
up, its almost like my body is salt in a glass of water, and through the  
sadhana it slowly melts into the water... but this is something "I" feel  
happening..its part of maya of course, no doubt about it, but its an acutal  
feeling not just an idea. and it feels wonderfull to be here right now, and  
because we talked about bliss, I have to say that experiencing the body is  
blissfull, when the body is not surpressed or ingnored or whatever...its not  
ultimate bliss but a kind of bliss that is naturally given in any wakefull  
moment...and you can feel and measure your happiness with the sensations of  
your body not with the mind...the body "feels" the fruits of your sadhana not  
the head...   
I would like to know if someone can relate to what I say, or if Iam running in  
the wrong direction....could be, I dont know   
sarva mangalam

You are not different from body. You and Body are a Whole.   
Why the difference is perceived? why does the mind want to stick to ideas  
about the body, the 'I'   
Its analysis about body is but itself, its analysis about the eternal I is  
again but itself. You, O entity analysing, rest in peace as the eternal Self,  
as it is, there is nothing to change or understand or become or attain!

dear nagaraj   
your answer is the highest teaching one can recieve, and I have recieved it,  
and you see here Iam still carring a name and doing sadhana   
...why? I dont know   
anyway it is the truth what you say so Iam thankfull for reminding me.   
\   
dear amiatall   
if you drop an concept it will always happen in an instant like everything  
arises spontaniously the concepts will arise and drop dead without someone who  
is in charge of it...it is just happening...   
I think (I dont know) that as long as I percieve myself as matthias and you as  
amiatall I have to practice, its as simple as that...all is in gods hands   
so how is this energy, this "iam" how does it feel, and how does it resonate  
with my body?   
is it a running away from my body if I rest as "iamness" or is it a "sinking"  
or "opening" of my body when I rest as awereness......for me its more an  
sinking deeper into my body...I feel my aliveness, and fromt hat feeling I can  
touch the aliveness of everything...the whole universe....when I run away from  
my body and think Iam contemplating hte "Iam" then Iam contemplating about my  
head   
really it feels like that for me, the energy moves upwards and my head is very  
tense, my chest and neck also...   
I remember the talks, a gentleman said ramana he is experiencing the same  
during sadhana, and he asked what this is..and ramana said its the ego...   
aqnd I gues shtis is a crucial point, because one can alway repeat "Iam the  
self", " all that arises is the self" and still life mostly in the head not in  
the heart

Dear matthias,   
I give below the anecdote taken from an article on Sat Darsanam,   
in the recent issue (April-June 2010) of Mountain Path, the Asramam   
magazine. The anecdote is self revealing: Lord Buddha's directives to his disciples was: "Be light unto yourself."   
King Prasenajit came to see the Buddh. He saw a large number of   
bhikkus bowing to him, saying Buddham saranam gacchami..(I surrender to the  
feet of Buddha). Prasenajit found a contradiction   
in this. He asked the Buddha: "Master! You tell the people, "Be light unto  
yourself". But even after this, when they surrender to you, and touch your  
feet, you do not prevent them. If you say, "Be   
light unto yourself", there is no need to surrender to anybody else*. So why  
should theyn fall at your feet?   
The Buddha, the enlightened laughed and said: "These are not my feet*. They  
are not surrendering to me, because there is nobody inside me* as the ego who  
can claim surrender. The disciples are   
simply surrendering. It is not surrender to me. Since they are not   
fully evolved* yet, they are not capable of simple surrender, without an  
excuse. My feet are just an excuse. I, as a person, do not exist!"   
(* According to my interpretation, these refer to egofull and egoless states  
of a devotee and a Brahma Jnani. For the former there is   
still a body, for later there is neither body, nor ego, no mind, he is   
the Self, the Effulgence., the Light unto Himself..)   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear I,   
What you have raised though is a very thought provoking enquiry. But the only  
thing on can do is to remain at peace with awareness about the awareness of  
"...why? I dont know"   
Just become aware of every reaction the mind has to offer and simply remain  
aware about it. What we try and do is to try adding a little bit of kerosene,  
petrol or diesel,. .. analyse what the mind has got to offer. But you sure  
know that whatever mind perceives and thinks, gets desperate, you are not  
going to get nearer to the truth, for you yourself are verily the Truth  
itself.   
The Mind simply gets impatient.   
Just remain aware. Be aware about all the mind has got to offer and simply  
remain, ignore the calls of mind, just be.   
At most what one can do is to just become aware of the fact of our own  
ignorance. The Mind tries to ascertain itself, but of no avail!   
Be aware, just be   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

This is also common in meditation. Energy moves upwards towards the head. The  
tenseness fades if the origin of the energy is the heart space. So even if  
there are sensations in the head, the essential awareness is in the heart  
space. (I hope by energy you mean the energy of consciousness.)   
Two good indications are: \- bliss   
\- anahat (unstruck sound)_   
no i meant the misstake that one thinks meditaion is "strong conentration"  
then the body energy moves to the head and it is very exhausting ot  
meditate...I made this mistakes for at least 1 year and it is still happening  
from time to time...   
the rest of your answer filled me with you

so many stories of the self. ..... so little time. ..... lol   
we were taught from birth by our parents and others the story of the self.   
you are david, you are susan, you are the one who did this or did that, you  
are good, you are bad. .. over and over until you said " yes, i am david,   
or i am susan", you BELIEVED the story you were told. this story of the self  
is the main belief thata all other beliefs are only a part of, the story that  
all things are compared to and filtered through. who you really are is what  
is UNCHANGED before and after all the stories of the self come and go,   
awareness itself, truth. you are ALREADY truth, you have only to STOP  
BELIEVING you are not. suffering comes from the minds attempt to avoid the  
truth of who we really are. truth is not a thing. the mind can only concieve  
of things, and so to the mind this nothingness is death, to be avoided at  
all cost. truth is simple and CANNOT be practiced. .. suffering is complex  
and REQUIRES much practice.

yes that was a very straightforward advaita answer.....but Iam wondering if it  
was a neoadvaitic answer or one that is really honest?   
anyway you can use talk like this for any topic of life, but you know what: this truth that you are presenting is still there even if you answer the  
questions that where raised from your own sources of knowledge and experience,  
from your whole organism, wich may be an illusion (I dont know hte scriptures  
say so)...but anyway its much more fun...and ramana maharshi also cooked, you  
see, he showed annamalai swami how to make plaster and encouraged him when he  
feeled depressed (when I udnerstood the stories right, maybe he didnt do this)   
anyway: for luminaries like ramana maharshi there is no development....Not at all.   
even for gautama siddharta was development till he realized, so   
if I tell you now with all my honesty IAM BRAHMAN will you believe me?   
or do I need to say YOU ARE BRAHMAN, will you believe me then without any  
further doubt?   
if yes, then what are you doing here? if you dont believe, then what is with  
the body dear sadhaka?   
after all IAM BRAHMAN is the truth, but it is truthfull to speak from the  
"personal" heart...that would be honest you know, also not a bad thing....   
to make my point more clear: if I ask you: "do you like icecream" and you say "drop your body mind and  
realize the immortal atman within"   
then you know...I would think about talking with you twice, the next  
time...because I allready know what kind of answer will come...   
"you like pizza also?" answer: "you are that!"...   
this is not meant to offend you, you see Iam curious about this, I also dont  
try to steal away your realisation if you are allready awake(how could I?), I  
just ask this simple question...what is with the body dear sadhak?   
may it be virtuous

Neo advaita makes it simple but it is not workable. What Beloved   
Abstract posted is not neo advaita, but simple Ajata Vada. Bhagavan   
Ramana was not realized until He reached 16 and then the advaitic   
realization came through death experience, which lasted for about   
15 to 20 minutes. In fact, for sometime, He was thinking that it was a  
pleasant disease! He says this in Sri Arunachala Ashtakam, Verse 1. The  
feeling of maruL, that is the feeling that it was a pleasant disease,  
disappeared when He 'saw' Arunachala. He says "How   
can I say, I saw. There is no 'seer' but only the non-moving Self.   
If I could not say 'I saw', how can I also say 'I could not see'? Who   
can explain this right from the beginning? You have explained this   
by your state of non-movement?   
We are all the Self. But it takes efforts, a lot of them, to realize that we  
are the Self. We are for long long time struggling with the   
various manifestations of non-Self. The Buddha attained it at the   
age of 50 or so. Bhagavan Ramana attained it at the age of 16.   
The devotional history in Tamil says only Tiru Jnana Sambandha attained at the  
age of 3.   
Well written Beloved Abstract.   
Arunachala Siva.
