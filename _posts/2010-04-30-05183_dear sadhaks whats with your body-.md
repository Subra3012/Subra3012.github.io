## dear sadhaks whats with your body?  
Author: matthias            Date: April 30, 2010, 10:27:04 AM

what I have read is that the idea "iam the body" is the main root of  
suffering.   
but I also witnessed this idea totally perverted or not? I would like to talk  
with you about the fact that there seems to be body for us, and waht this  
means, how is our relationship with it? or are we already beyond body  
conciousness? who knows?   
anyway I think this is a very challenging topic, and we should take some time  
to talk about it, I have some doubts here and maybe they can be cleared.  
besides the doubts I also dont like what I see in some meditators, they seem  
to use meditation to kill the body, make it like a piece of would "totally in  
control"....its horrible to witness. so maybe we can find a way to use the  
body for sadhana instead of torture it till we die?   
hope some people will join me here.   
my first input would be this, if you like try it out.....   
you know this photo of bhagawan: please look at it for some time, first thing you will recognize are his  
incredible eyes of course, they seem to talk with the deepest core of your  
beeing but I would like you to focus on another part of his face.   
please look at the muscles arround his eyes, what do they say? you see how  
relaxed (totally relaxed) they are?   
now recognize his face, its totally realxed.....not the slightest bit of fear  
or personality are in the muscles...can you feel what this means, con you feel  
how your face muscles try to answer what ramanas muscles say?   
now use you awereness to look at your own face, use ramana as a mirror...what  
do you feel, can you feel tension some where?   
switch back and forth betwenn youself and what the face of ramana  
suggests...its like a quiete reminder how it feels to drop the idea "iam the  
body"...   
most meditators run in the exact opposite direction...and complain "why do I  
not feel bliss during my sadhana"?   
I would answer relax you body completely during your meditation and during hte  
day, and tell me how it feels....the mind becomes very silent and the body  
very blissfull..   
I feel like I sometimes put on a harnish, or a whole armor build up from  
muscle tension to face the world....   
to harden this harnish, that your body is like the non-moving, ever-present  
atman...you know....I think this is the wrong direciton...   
my dzogchen teacher said that abidence in the nature of mind (Self) is  
developed through relaxation.   
its a very deep sentence when you think about...but one need to understand  
"relax" in the right way.   
its about relaxation into your true nature, into the inherent perfection of  
htis moment, its relaxation of your energies, your body and thoughts...

Body remains as body for non seekers but it remains an effulgence   
for Jnanis. Bhagavan Ramana said that the body and the world   
would still be there, but all bodies would appear as Arunachala   
Swarupam and all the world would appear as Swarupam. Bhagavan   
Ramana saw the old, dark complexioned, labourers, with sweating   
body and tattered clothes in the Hill, as Arunachala Swarupam.   
This is what the verse 5 of Sri Arunachala Pancharatnam also says.   
Arunachala Siva.

thank you for the replies so far.   
what is interessting for me is: how does it feel to be conciousness "embodied"  
if you like...if this body is god, how does it feel when you actually  
surrender your body to god?   
I guess the "experience" that Iam the self, is some how beyond body  
conciousness, but there is no shortcut for most sadhaks, they have to go  
through the body...not sneak arorund it or jump over it in an fearless act of  
faith...for me I have to be the body in order to let it go...Iam not in hte  
position to simply drop it, or forget it..because I would supress it, and  
ignore it though my mind...and eventually end moving arround like a robot...   
through kum nye (a part of tsa lung, an form of yogic exerices from tibet) and  
dzogchen meditation, my body and the knots and blocked energies seem to loosen  
up, its almost like my body is salt in a glass of water, and through the  
sadhana it slowly melts into the water... but this is something "I" feel  
happening..its part of maya of course, no doubt about it, but its an acutal  
feeling not just an idea. and it feels wonderfull to be here right now, and  
because we talked about bliss, I have to say that experiencing the body is  
blissfull, when the body is not surpressed or ingnored or whatever...its not  
ultimate bliss but a kind of bliss that is naturally given in any wakefull  
moment...and you can feel and measure your happiness with the sensations of  
your body not with the mind...the body "feels" the fruits of your sadhana not  
the head...   
I would like to know if someone can relate to what I say, or if Iam running in  
the wrong direction....could be, I dont know   
sarva mangalam

You are not different from body. You and Body are a Whole.   
Why the difference is perceived? why does the mind want to stick to ideas  
about the body, the 'I'   
Its analysis about body is but itself, its analysis about the eternal I is  
again but itself. You, O entity analysing, rest in peace as the eternal Self,  
as it is, there is nothing to change or understand or become or attain!

dear nagaraj   
your answer is the highest teaching one can recieve, and I have recieved it,  
and you see here Iam still carring a name and doing sadhana   
...why? I dont know   
anyway it is the truth what you say so Iam thankfull for reminding me.   
\   
dear amiatall   
if you drop an concept it will always happen in an instant like everything  
arises spontaniously the concepts will arise and drop dead without someone who  
is in charge of it...it is just happening...   
I think (I dont know) that as long as I percieve myself as matthias and you as  
amiatall I have to practice, its as simple as that...all is in gods hands   
so how is this energy, this "iam" how does it feel, and how does it resonate  
with my body?   
is it a running away from my body if I rest as "iamness" or is it a "sinking"  
or "opening" of my body when I rest as awereness......for me its more an  
sinking deeper into my body...I feel my aliveness, and fromt hat feeling I can  
touch the aliveness of everything...the whole universe....when I run away from  
my body and think Iam contemplating hte "Iam" then Iam contemplating about my  
head   
really it feels like that for me, the energy moves upwards and my head is very  
tense, my chest and neck also...   
I remember the talks, a gentleman said ramana he is experiencing the same  
during sadhana, and he asked what this is..and ramana said its the ego...   
aqnd I gues shtis is a crucial point, because one can alway repeat "Iam the  
self", " all that arises is the self" and still life mostly in the head not in  
the heart

Dear matthias,   
I give below the anecdote taken from an article on Sat Darsanam,   
in the recent issue (April-June 2010) of Mountain Path, the Asramam   
magazine. The anecdote is self revealing: Lord Buddha's directives to his disciples was: "Be light unto yourself."   
King Prasenajit came to see the Buddh. He saw a large number of   
bhikkus bowing to him, saying Buddham saranam gacchami..(I surrender to the  
feet of Buddha). Prasenajit found a contradiction   
in this. He asked the Buddha: "Master! You tell the people, "Be light unto  
yourself". But even after this, when they surrender to you, and touch your  
feet, you do not prevent them. If you say, "Be   
light unto yourself", there is no need to surrender to anybody else*. So why  
should theyn fall at your feet?   
The Buddha, the enlightened laughed and said: "These are not my feet*. They  
are not surrendering to me, because there is nobody inside me* as the ego who  
can claim surrender. The disciples are   
simply surrendering. It is not surrender to me. Since they are not   
fully evolved* yet, they are not capable of simple surrender, without an  
excuse. My feet are just an excuse. I, as a person, do not exist!"   
(* According to my interpretation, these refer to egofull and egoless states  
of a devotee and a Brahma Jnani. For the former there is   
still a body, for later there is neither body, nor ego, no mind, he is   
the Self, the Effulgence., the Light unto Himself..)   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear I,   
What you have raised though is a very thought provoking enquiry. But the only  
thing on can do is to remain at peace with awareness about the awareness of  
"...why? I dont know"   
Just become aware of every reaction the mind has to offer and simply remain  
aware about it. What we try and do is to try adding a little bit of kerosene,  
petrol or diesel,. .. analyse what the mind has got to offer. But you sure  
know that whatever mind perceives and thinks, gets desperate, you are not  
going to get nearer to the truth, for you yourself are verily the Truth  
itself.   
The Mind simply gets impatient.   
Just remain aware. Be aware about all the mind has got to offer and simply  
remain, ignore the calls of mind, just be.   
At most what one can do is to just become aware of the fact of our own  
ignorance. The Mind tries to ascertain itself, but of no avail!   
Be aware, just be   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

everything...the whole universe....when I run away from my body and think Iam  
contemplating hte "Iam" then Iam contemplating about my head  
This is a good point. Through my liveliness I feel the liveliness of the  
whole.   
I think different people restate this point in different ways. Some like to  
call it "liveliness of the whole" and eliminate "my liveliness" altogether  
either because: \- during meditation the "I" starts fading and there appears to be a single  
continuity of liveliness, or   
\- from words of saints learnt that there is a single continuum of  
consciousness, therefore ignore whatever "I" is felt   
\- actually feel that the liveliness is the actual reality and body is part of  
it   
Quote  
really it feels like that for me, the energy moves upwards and my head is very  
tense, my chest and neck also...  
This is also common in meditation. Energy moves upwards towards the head. The  
tenseness fades if the origin of the energy is the heart space. So even if  
there are sensations in the head, the essential awareness is in the heart  
space. (I hope by energy you mean the energy of consciousness.)   
Two good indications are: \- bliss   
\- anahat (unstruck sound)   
I can also relate to your other descriptions like: Quote  
my body and the knots and blocked energies seem to loosen up,  
if blocked energies are loosened, the gross body consciousness seem to melt in  
the inner body consciousness which is more subtle...to a point that "body  
consciousness" appears to be nearing "consciousness" itself.

no i meant the misstake that one thinks meditaion is "strong conentration"  
then the body energy moves to the head and it is very exhausting ot  
meditate...I made this mistakes for at least 1 year and it is still happening  
from time to time...   
the rest of your answer filled me with you

so many stories of the self. ..... so little time. ..... lol   
we were taught from birth by our parents and others the story of the self.   
you are david, you are susan, you are the one who did this or did that, you  
are good, you are bad. .. over and over until you said " yes, i am david,   
or i am susan", you BELIEVED the story you were told. this story of the self  
is the main belief thata all other beliefs are only a part of, the story that  
all things are compared to and filtered through. who you really are is what  
is UNCHANGED before and after all the stories of the self come and go,   
awareness itself, truth. you are ALREADY truth, you have only to STOP  
BELIEVING you are not. suffering comes from the minds attempt to avoid the  
truth of who we really are. truth is not a thing. the mind can only concieve  
of things, and so to the mind this nothingness is death, to be avoided at  
all cost. truth is simple and CANNOT be practiced. .. suffering is complex  
and REQUIRES much practice.

yes that was a very straightforward advaita answer.....but Iam wondering if it  
was a neoadvaitic answer or one that is really honest?   
anyway you can use talk like this for any topic of life, but you know what: this truth that you are presenting is still there even if you answer the  
questions that where raised from your own sources of knowledge and experience,  
from your whole organism, wich may be an illusion (I dont know hte scriptures  
say so)...but anyway its much more fun...and ramana maharshi also cooked, you  
see, he showed annamalai swami how to make plaster and encouraged him when he  
feeled depressed (when I udnerstood the stories right, maybe he didnt do this)   
anyway: for luminaries like ramana maharshi there is no development....Not at all.   
even for gautama siddharta was development till he realized, so   
if I tell you now with all my honesty IAM BRAHMAN will you believe me?   
or do I need to say YOU ARE BRAHMAN, will you believe me then without any  
further doubt?   
if yes, then what are you doing here? if you dont believe, then what is with  
the body dear sadhaka?   
after all IAM BRAHMAN is the truth, but it is truthfull to speak from the  
"personal" heart...that would be honest you know, also not a bad thing....   
to make my point more clear: if I ask you: "do you like icecream" and you say "drop your body mind and  
realize the immortal atman within"   
then you know...I would think about talking with you twice, the next  
time...because I allready know what kind of answer will come...   
"you like pizza also?" answer: "you are that!"...   
this is not meant to offend you, you see Iam curious about this, I also dont  
try to steal away your realisation if you are allready awake(how could I?), I  
just ask this simple question...what is with the body dear sadhak?   
may it be virtuous

Neo advaita makes it simple but it is not workable. What Beloved   
Abstract posted is not neo advaita, but simple Ajata Vada. Bhagavan   
Ramana was not realized until He reached 16 and then the advaitic   
realization came through death experience, which lasted for about   
15 to 20 minutes. In fact, for sometime, He was thinking that it was a  
pleasant disease! He says this in Sri Arunachala Ashtakam, Verse 1. The  
feeling of maruL, that is the feeling that it was a pleasant disease,  
disappeared when He 'saw' Arunachala. He says "How   
can I say, I saw. There is no 'seer' but only the non-moving Self.   
If I could not say 'I saw', how can I also say 'I could not see'? Who   
can explain this right from the beginning? You have explained this   
by your state of non-movement?   
We are all the Self. But it takes efforts, a lot of them, to realize that we  
are the Self. We are for long long time struggling with the   
various manifestations of non-Self. The Buddha attained it at the   
age of 50 or so. Bhagavan Ramana attained it at the age of 16.   
The devotional history in Tamil says only Tiru Jnana Sambandha attained at the  
age of 3.   
Well written Beloved Abstract.   
Arunachala Siva.
