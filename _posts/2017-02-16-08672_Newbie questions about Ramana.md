## Newbie questions about Ramana  
Author: kripa44             Date: February 16, 2017, 12:57:54 AM

Namaste All,   
I have been studying Advaita Vedanta for quite some time now and I have come  
across so many great testimonials about Ramana Maharshi. I have been able to  
get the gist of his teachings but several doubts still linger. I hope to get  
them clarified.   
My first query is : Did Ramana practice and preach Advaita. I know he didn't  
pro actively preach anything but can his teachings be called Advaita. I got  
this doubt because the Wikipedia page on Ramana Maharshi says his teachings  
are different from Advaita Vedanta.   
Second : I have read 'I am that' by Nisargadatta Maharaj. Can I reconcile  
Ramana's teachings with that of Nisargadatta Maharaj.   
Third : can Ramana Maharshi be seen as a liberal alternative to the rigid  
caste-conscious traditional Vedantins?   
Thanks

Dear kripa44,   
Namaste!   
Welcome to the forum.   
About Bhagavan's teachings,well,in philosophical therms,His main teaching is  
certainly 'Nothing ever happened'. This is,sure,seen ans spoken from the  
perspective of the Self realized Sage. But,Bhagavan preached differently  
according to temperaments of many different seekers who came to Him searching  
for the Truth.   
His ultimate teaching is certainly only Silence.   
Yes,i could say He certainly preached Advaita Vedanta. But,i also saw aspects  
of all other philosophies and teachings in His words. So,for me,it is very  
hard to put Him in any category.   
And there lies His Greatness actually. In every sense His teachings are much  
more than Advaita,Dvaita,and such. They are based on the Truth,and they  
incorporate all philosophies. The reason is everything about Bhagavan; His  
unique temperament,His beautiful nature,His way of approach to devotees,to all  
aound Him,to the world in general. And,most important,His way of approach to  
the Self. So to say. And there lies His liberality,how You call it. It is the  
same Truth,but the Truth preached from the mouth of one beautiful man,in every  
sense of this word. Of the One who spoke only from the highest state,from Love  
Itself.   
So,'the Sage' is the right word to describe Bhgavan. Or how many call Him,the  
Silent Sage of Arunachala.   
Advaita Vedanta or not, i find these classifications truly non important. And  
i could never make one. I feel,it would make everything about Bhagavan rigid  
and placed it in some category,when He is above all categories. Simply,the  
beauty would be lost.   
In fact,that can be said for many Great Sages. They always preached the  
highest Truth,but gave it names only for our sake.   
Regarding Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj,i find His teachings to be same as  
Bhagavan's. Leading to the same Self,same Truth and Reality. They only differ  
in temperament and style. Someone preferes Bhagavan,someone Maharaj,but  
again,it only depends on the temperament of each seeker.   
With love and prayers,

Thanks for the welcome Jewell.   
I must say, I am quite satisfied by your answer. When I thought of Ramana as a  
'liberal alternative to the traditional Vedanta', I was thinking within the  
Advaitic framework. But you have correctly pointed out that, he transcends  
even philosophical categorisations.   
Another thing I'd like to add about Nisargadatta is that, I found his  
teachings to be very similar to Ramana. Owing to Ramana's silent nature, many  
think that Ramana's teachings are only for the advanced seekers whereas  
newbies like me find Nisargadatta's teachings to be more detailed compared to  
Ramana's. Hence I wanted to know if there are any subtle variations or  
differences among the two.   
I thank you again for your kind response.

OM Namo Bhagavate Sri Arunchala Ramanaya   
Dear Kripa,   
Welcome to this forum.   
Most Vedantic teachers today talks about Sravana, Manana and Nidhidhyasan of  
Maha Vakyams. This results in the mind thinking / imagining about Brahman and  
tries hard to claim that I am Brahman. The outcome faced by most who followed  
this process is thus confusion.   
One of the works of Bhagavan (Ulladhu Narpathu) : Do we say continuously man  
to claim that I am man.   
For a Vedantic student who wants to start understanding Bhagavan's teachings,  
I would suggest the book: Tamil book: Ramana Vazhi by Sadhu OM. Available for purchase at Sri  
Ramanasramam Book store (one can buy online from their online store too)   
English translation of this book (The Path of Ramana) is also available  
(http://www.happinessofbeing.com/path_ramana.html)   
Wish you all the best in your quest.   
Ramesh

Thanks for the valuable suggestion Ramesh.   
One thing I have observed among Ramana's disciples/followers is that there is  
no unanimity with regards to Ramana's original teachings. Hence I'd like to  
ask you this : who is the best authority in all matters concerning Ramana?   
Further, I'd like to know your thoughts on the similarity and difference  
between Vedanta and Ramana's teachings. Whether the philosophy is same but  
approach is different or both are different or both are same. From your  
response, it appears that the philosophy is same but approach is different.  
Please help me resolve this doubt.   
Regards   
Kripa

Trying to understand any philosophy (inc Vedanta) will not take one anywhere.  
Pl read the book suggested.

Dear Kripa   
I don't know what book will help you... close everything and just go to  
ramanasramam once...sit in silence...   
that surrender will reveal peace and courage for sadhana...   
bhagavan has acknowledged traditional readings of ribhu gita, yoga vashishta  
etc.   
he has also read out from bhaktha vijayam tamil edition book ( devotional  
lives of marati and saiva saints) during his lifetime.   
Bhagavan ultimate Truth is no creation or ajata... constant thinking of  
aruncahala hill, bhagavan ramana form will slowly eradicate vasanas...   
Bhagavan also advocated repetition of shiva, shiva to some devotees.   
Bhagavan maintained that constant practice ( japa or self enquiry) until the  
final moment of self realization is required...   
the individual personality is a obstacle for realization...   
endless philosophical questions need not be considered by our already heated  
brains   
let Bhagavan give peace to you and all
