## The names and forms in life.  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 09, 2009, 07:52:10 AM  
---  
During my visits to Tiruvannamalai, a thought has always struck me,   
that the names of the children in any town, are after the deity of the   
place or after the Sage who lived there. I find "Annamalai", in every  
household of Tiruvannamalai. The girls are named "Unnamulai."   
Similarly, devotees of Bhagavan Ramana named their children 'Ramana', 'Ramana  
Sundari' or 'Azhagamma'.   
In Madurai, you find every girl to be Meenakshi. In Srivilliputtur,   
the girls are invariably AndaL. In Kanchipuram, they are either   
Kamakshi or Varadarajan. Ekambaram and Alamelu are on the   
backstage. In Chidambaram, every boy or girl is either Natarajan or   
Sivakami.   
In Karnataka, they are Nanjunda (Siva of Nanjangud) or Raghavendra. In  
Andhra, they are Venkateswara Raos. In Kerala,   
in everyhousehold, you find Ayyappas and Krishanas. There are   
Ayyappa Panikkar, Ayyappan Nairs, Ayyappa Menons, Guruvayur   
Krishnan Nambudris. In Maharashtra, you find Vittal Raos, Ekanaths.   
There are unfortunately no Godses, because of the negative impact of that name  
after Gandhi's murder.

## The Child is the Father of the Man!  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 09, 2009, 07:30:52 AM  
---  
In a recent wedding, at a relative of my wife, almost all the guests   
were new to me and were known to my wife only. To each every,   
inquisitive guest, I had to keep on telling that I was so and so.   
I almost lost my patience. To some guest, who asked looking at me: "You..?" Then I am told him, "I am married to Geetha, so I am her   
husband!" That guest was still not fully satisfied. "But she is S. Geetha?"  
he continued. (My wife is called 'S.Geetha' because there are so many Geethas  
in the family.)   
Still, the inquisitive guest could not satisfy himself. Then I thought   
I should give a final reply. "Yes. Her father is Subramania Iyer.   
I am also Subramanian (Iyer). So, she continues to remain as S.   
Geetha..."   
The Child is Father of the Man!

## Eyes open or closed ?  
Author: mikroth             Date: March 10, 2009, 05:44:05 PM

Practising Who am I? with eyes closed tends, for me, to bring more challenges  
in I-thoughts.   
Practising Who am I? with eyes open, for me, brings more rest of the sight and  
fewer I-thoughts..   
Is there any recommendation or instruction that is given as a general  
guideline ?

Hi Mikroth   
I believe that Sri Ramana practiced for many years with eyes closed, but in  
his later years with eyes open.   
(Not that I've read of any prescriptions, in this respect.)   
Best wishes   
Paul

Dear Mikrioth,   
Bhagawan always said Self is your Guru. As your Self is Bhagawan himself.  
Listen to your InnerSelf. It will always guide you correctly!

Dear milkroth and Nagaraj,   
For mature practisers, either way is okay. But for beginners,   
Bhagavan Ramana told, when an identical question was asked   
by Annamalai Swami: "Keeping eyes closed, is like hitting a ball, standing close to the   
wall. The ball will come back, with equal force and hit you back.   
You have to throw it to the wall from a distance, so that it may   
not rebound with much force. Similarly, beginners should practise   
meditation/self enquiry, with eyes open, because the mind will   
not disturb you with much force. With eyes closed, the mind's mischief/force  
will be more."   
 \- Annamalai Swami - Final Talks.   
The mind becomes more active, because the eyes are closed. This   
we experience, while going to bed for sleep. With lights off, and body   
at rest, the mind plays havoc, and one does not get sleep, unless   
one clears up the mind, from thoughts.   
Bhagavan Ramana kept His eyes closed in Patala Lingam, and other   
places, till He came to Virupaksha Cave, more because, He did not   
want to 'see' anyone. If any one sees His with eyes open, he will   
come and ask questions, and hence He avoided such disturbances   
by closing His eyes.   
Arunachala Siva.

## "Hello! Watson, can you hear me?"  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 11, 2009, 10:00:53 AM  
---  
Thomas Alva Edison has got 100 inventions in his name. After hard   
work, he invented the telephone. He arranged the wires and asked   
his friend Watson, to try to hear him when he spoke. Watson heard   
him saying: "Hello! Watson, can you hear me?" He came to Edison   
running and said that he heard Edison's words. Watson was jumping   
with joy. After sometime, he asked Edison: "Are you not immensely happy with  
this?" Edison said: "Of course. But I am more happy   
when we understand that the all-powerful God can also hear my   
prayers here from the earth, in the Heavens!"   
A seeker's words will always be heard by Guru or God. It need not   
be loud prayers. It should be full of devotion and sincerity. That is   
all. When Gajendra, the elephant called "O Adimoolam!", Vishnu, it   
is said came running to the river. He did not even wait for the vehicle   
Garuda. He did not even bother about his falling uppercloth. Srimad   
Bhagavatam says, He came in such a hurry and pierced the crocodile   
with His disc!   
When the child-saint Tiru Jnana Sambandhar was crying on bank of   
the tank in Sirkazhi, when he could not see his father, Siva and Uma,   
came swiftly and Uma gave Him the breast-milk. Then only the child-   
saint sang His first song!   
Arunachala Siva.
