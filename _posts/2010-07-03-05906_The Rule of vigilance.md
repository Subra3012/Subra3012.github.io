Dear devotees,   
 I came across an interesting article in the internet titled "The Rule Of Vigilance" by Dr. Sarada who is a staunch devotee of Bhagavan Ramana.The article appears in the web site <http://rmclb.tripod.com/jan99.htm#first>.It is a very practical article on Self Enquiry and it clears all the doubts which may arise to practitioner of self enquiry.Every sadhaka especially new sadhaka should go through this article.
