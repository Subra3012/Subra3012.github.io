## Pure awareness--Ego awareness and Self-inquiry.

Suppose on a plain paper we mark a zero with a pencil,we feel   
that zero mark is really zero.If we carefully observe even when we think that  
mark of pencil indicates zero with no value   
its background is plain paper which is there even before marking zero by the  
pencil and it will be there even after   
erasing the pencil mark of zero.   
Similarly on the screen of awareness for functional purpose   
awareness mind is created whose essential nature is nothingness.That mind  
gives direction to the awareness   
so that awareness can function in the fleeting phenomenal reality.Mind has an  
utilitarian value in the phenomenal reality   
because awareness acts through it,just like pencil mark of zero on the plain  
paper has utilitarian value.Noe if we want   
have only plain paper we have to erase the pencil mark of zero.Similarly if we  
want to know the nature of awareness   
which is the background of mind,first we must know the   
nature of mind which is nothingness.Once we know that   
a gestalt in our attitude happens and we observe the   
nature of awareness which is the background of the mind.   
We direct our attention towards the source of mind   
which is awareness.The real can be known only through the false, so the ego is  
a must. One has to pass through it. It is a discipline. The real can be known  
only through the illusion. You cannot know the truth directly. First you have  
to know that which is not true. First you have to encounter the untrue.  
Through that encounter you become capable of knowing the truth. If you know  
the false as the false, truth will dawn upon you. So you have two centers. One  
center you come with, which is given by existence itself. That is the self.  
And the other center, which is created by the society, is the ego. It is a  
false thing - and it is a very great trick. Through the ego the society is  
controlling you. You have to behave in a certain way, because only then does  
the society appreciate you. You have to walk in a certain way; you have to  
laugh in a certain way; you have to follow certain manners, a morality, a  
code. Only then will the society appreciate you, and if it doesn't, you ego  
will be shaken. And when the ego is shaken, you don't know where you are, who  
you are.   
The others have given you the idea. That idea is the ego.   
That which is given by the existence is the screen of awareness.That which is  
written on your screen by the   
society is the false center of awareness or ego.If we are   
aware that our essential nature is screen of awareness   
that which is written on the screen will not affect us.   
Suppose there is news paper,we can see the letters on it   
and forget for the time being that writing and reading of   
letters are possible only because paper is there to write   
or read something on it.If we are aware of the fact then   
gestalt happens and we recognize that paper is the background of all these  
letters.Just as letters written with   
white chalk piece on a black board are very clear,we can see   
the contents of the mind,its thoughts,feelings with the background of  
awareness which is possible in Self-inquiry.   
The ego is not individual. Ego is a social phenomenon - it is society, its not  
you. But it gives you a function in the society, a hierarchy in the society.  
And if you remain satisfied with it, you will miss the whole opportunity of  
finding the self.   
And that's why you are so miserable. Try to understand it as deeply as  
possible, because this has to be thrown. And unless you throw it you will  
never be able to attain to the self. Because you are addicted to the center,  
you cannot move, and you cannot look at the self. This throwing is possible  
only through Self-inquiry.

## The nature of consciousness,mind and the need for Self-inquiry.  
Author: DRPVSSNRAJU         Date: June 23, 2010, 03:09:37 PM

Mind is consciousness in movement.When that movement stops minding  
stops.Suppose we are walking   
and if stop walking legs will be there but the process,the function of walking  
stops.It is like pedalling a   
cycle.As long as you pedal the cycle moves,if you stop pedalling the cycle  
stops moving but cycle will be   
there.So when minding stops consciousness remains as a silent pool of energy.   
You are that consciousness.   
Minding is a function of consciousness but your nature is not the minding.   
The nature of minding is movement.If that movement is stopped due to any  
reason there is nothing like   
mind.Thought is the mind.If there is stilling of thought due to any reason  
there is no entity like   
mind(naiva manasam).   
In such a state we encounter static aspect of consciousness in full senses.   
The nature of such static consciousness is existence,Self-  
knowledge(awareness),bliss   
(Tranquility,peace).   
You think you are the mind. This fallacy that you are the mind gives the mind  
total freedom, because   
then there is no one to master it, to control it. There is no one! Mind itself  
becomes the master. It may   
become the master, but that mastery is just seemingly so. Try once and you can  
break that mastery  it   
is false.This breaking up of process of minding is possible in Self-  
inquiry.Then you will know for yourself   
about   
what is the nature of static aspect of consciousness and what is the nature of  
the minding which is just   
the dynamic function of consciousness.There is nothing wrong in minding but  
identity with that minding   
and thinking that minding as the me(thinker) is the wrong state of  
affairs.Then we go on minding   
(thinking) whether it is   
required or not.Self-inquiry stops that pathological minding,(thinking)   
and we develop mastery over the minding(thinking).If we master the  
minding(thinking) it is one of the   
best servant.But at   
present mind is behaving like a master   
without any control bringing so much disaster,disorder,chaos to the individual  
and society at   
large.Through Self-inquiry we develop the capacity to allow minding(thinking)  
when it is necessary and   
stop   
minding(thinking) where it has no role to play.For example thought i.e  
minding(thinking) has no role to   
play in human relation   
but we are relating with the other through thought only which definitely  
brings conflict,strife in the   
relationship.Then if we can posit in   
static aspect of consciousness during relating with the other,the relating   
is based on present moment and we have a healthy relationship.   
In science,technology we require minding and we should allow minding  
there.Once that task is over we   
should not go on minding but we should be back to our natural center of static  
aspect of consciousness   
and enjoy the serenity,tranquility,peace,bliss of it.This is possible through  
Self-inquiry.   
Then we become the master of our own mind which is superior than being   
emperor of the whole world.Existence feels fulfilled through us by becoming   
master of the mind.This is the purpose for which we are born on earth but   
we are preoccupied with doing all sorts of silly things which takes us no  
where   
from the present state of highly disordered life.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Part 1 - Few Teachings Of Ramana Maharshi  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 27, 2010, 08:27:13 AM  
---  
"Glory to Sri Ramana the Sage,   
Who firmly established in devotion   
to the Lotus-feet of Arunachaleswara,   
can undo the evil of the world and   
the misery of those who take refuge   
in Him. Glory to Ramana,   
glowing with merciful love for all."   
"Bhagavan Sri Ramana's Realization is unique   
and unparalleled in the annals of history.   
He realised in his boyhood the Eternal Truth,   
the Self Supreme, without the aid of initiation   
by any external Guru, without the need for   
theoretical knowledge and without any study   
of the Scriptures, and without having resorted   
to any ritualistic form of worship.....other than   
his spontaneous realization of the eternal nature   
of the "I", the Self Supreme."   
 **The sense of body is a thought;   
the thought is of the mind,   
The mind rises after the "I"-thought,   
the "I"-thought is the root-thought.   
If that is held,   
the other thoughts will disappear.   
There will be no body,   
no mind, not even the ego;   
only the Self in all its purity.**   
To remain as the Self   
is not difficult.   
 **Why should one think of birth and death?   
Are you really born?   
....all these are only of the mind.   
So long as the body is considered,   
birth is real. But the body is not "I".   
The Self is not born, nor does it die.   
There is nothing new.   
The Sages see everything as being   
in and of the Self;   
there is no diversity in it,   
Therefore, there is neither birth nor death.**   
The soul remains always uncontaminated.   
It is the substratum funning through these three states:  **Wakefulness passes off, I Am   
the dream state passes off, I Am;   
the sleep states passes off, I Am;   
They repeat themselves,   
and yet "I Am" remains.   
They are like pictures   
moving on a screen at the cinema show.   
They do not affect the screen.   
"I Am" remains unaffected...**   
Any new appearances are bound to disappear.   
Anything created will certainly be destroyed.   
The eternal is not born nor does it die.   
We are now confounding appearances with reality.   
Appearance carries its end in itself.   
What is it that appears newly?   
If you cannot find it, surrender unreservedly   
to the substratum of appearances;   
then, the reality remains as residue.   
Engage yourself in the living present.   
The future will take care of itself.   
Do not worry about the future.   
Doubts cease when the confusion is surpassed.   
Engage in self-investigation,   
then the non-self will disappear.   
The Self will be left over.   
This is self-investigation of the Self.   
The one word "Self"   
is equivalent to the mind,   
body, man, individual,   
the Supreme and all else.   
The Real is That what is;   
the others are only appearances.   
Diversity is not its nature.   
 **We are reading the printed characters   
on paper, but ignore the paper   
which is the background.   
Similarly, you are taken up by the manifestations   
of the mind, and let go the background.   
Whose fault is it?**   
Is there a difference between the   
individual soul and the Self?   
That is what IS.   
The mind obstructs the innate peace.   
Our investigation is only in the mind.   
Investigate the mind;   
then it will disappear.   
There is no entity by the name "mind."   
Because of the emergence of thoughts,   
we surmise something from which they start;   
that we term "mind."   
When we probe to see what it is,   
there is nothing of the sort.   
After it has vanished,   
Peace will be found to remain eternal.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Part 1- Reality In Forty Verses (Ulladu Narpadu) : Supplement

Reality in Forty Verses: Supplement   
 **Invocation**   
That which is the Support, the Soul, the Source, the Purpose and the Power of  
all this world, the Reality behind all this Appearance, That indeed exists.  
Let That, the Truth, abide in our Heart. (Yoga Vasishta, 8, v.12)   
 **The Text**   
 **1\. In the company of sages, attachment vanishes; and with attachment,  
illusion. Freed from illusion, one attains stability, and thence liberation  
while yet alive. Seek therefore the company of sages. (from Bhajagovindam, the  
Mohamudagaram Hymn, by Shankaracharya)**   
 **2\. Not by listening to preachers, nor by study of books,not by meritorious  
deeds nor by any other means can one attain that Supreme State, which is  
attainable only through association with the sages and the clear quest of the  
Self.(a verse from the Yoga Vasishta, 5 - 12 - v.17)**   
 **3\. When one has learned to love the company of sages,wherefore all these  
rules of discipline? When a pleasant, cool southern breeze is blowing, what  
need is there for a fan? (a verse from the Yoga Vasishta)**   
4\. Fever is overcome by the cool light of the moon;want, by the good wish-  
yielding tree; and sin by the Holy Ganges. Those three  fever and want and  
sin  all flee at   
the august sight of the peerless sage. (Subhashita Ratna Bhandargara, chapt.  
3, v. 6)   
5\. Holy rivers, which are only water, and idols, which are made of stone and  
clay, are not as mighty as the sages.For while they make one pure in course of  
countless days, the sages eyes by a mere glance purify at once. (from Srimad  
Bhagavatam, chapt. 48, v. 31, tenth canto)   
6\. Disciple: Who is God?   
Master: He who knows the mind.   
D: My Self, the Spirit, knows my mind.   
M: Therefore you are God; and also the sruti declares   
that there is only one God, the Knower.   
 **7\. M: By what light do you see?   
D: The sun by day, the lamp by night.   
M: By what light do you see these lights?   
D: The eye.   
M: By what light do you see the eye?   
D: The mind.   
M: By what light do you know the mind?   
D: My Self.   
M: You then are the Light of Lights.   
D: Yes, That I am.   
(from Ekasloki, by Shankaracharya)**   
8\. In the centre of the Heart-Cave there shines alone the one Brahman as the  
I, I, the Atman. Reach the Heart by diving deep in quest of the Self, or by  
controlling the mind with the breath, and stay established in the Atman.   
 **9\. In the lotus of the Heart is pure and changeless Consciousness in the  
form of the Self. When the ego is removed, this Consciousness of Self bestows  
liberation   
of soul. (Devikalottaram, v. 46)**   
 **10\. The body is like an earthen pot, inert. Because it has no  
consciousness of I, and because daily in bodiless sleep we touch our real  
nature, the body is not I. Then who is this I? Where is this I? In the  
Heart-cave of those that question thus,there shineth forth as I, Himself,  
the Lord Siva of Arunachala.**   
11\. Who is born? It is only he who asks Whence am I born? that is truly  
born in Brahman, the Prime Source. He indeed is born eternally; He is the Lord  
of saints; He is the ever-new. (On celebrating Sri Bhagavans jayanti))   
12\. Cast off the notion, This vile flesh am I, and seek the ceaseless bliss  
of Self. To seek the Self while cherishing this perishing flesh is like trying  
to cross a stream by clinging to a crocodile.   
13\. The way of charity, penance, sacrifice, dharma, yoga and bhakti; and the  
Goal of Heaven, Reality, Peace, Truth,Grace, Silence, Stability, Deathless  
Death, Knowledge,   
Renunciation, Liberation, Bliss  all this is only ceasing to think that the  
body is the Self.   
14\. What is action, or devotion, or union, or knowledge? It is to inquire,  
Whose is this action, or indifference, or separateness, or ignorance?  
Inquiring thus, the ego vanishes.To abide as the Self, wherein these eight  
have never been, this is True existence.   
15\. Not realizing that they themselves are moved by an energy not their own,  
some fools are busy seeking miraculous powers. Their antics are like the  
boasting of a cripple who says to his friends: If you raise me to my feet,  
these enemies are nothing before me.   
16\. Since the stilling of the mind is true liberation and miraculous powers  
are unattainable without an act of the mind,how can they whose mind is set on  
such powers enter the bliss of liberation which is the ending of all activity  
of the mind?   
 **17\. While God sustains the burden of the world, the spurious ego assumes  
its burden, grimacing like an image on a tower, seeming to support it. If the  
traveller in a carriage,which can carry any weight, does not lay his luggage  
down but carries it painfully on his head, whose is the fault?**   
18\. Between the two paps, below the chest, above the stomach, there are six  
organs of various colours. Of these,one, looking like a lily bud, is the  
Heart, at two digits distance to the right of the centre. (from Ashtanga  
Hridayam,Malayalam)   
19\. Its mouth is closed. Within its cavity is seated a heavy darkness, filled  
with all desires; all the great nerves are centred there; the home it is of  
breath, mind, light of knowledge. (from Ashtanga Hridayam, Malayalam)

## Re:[1] Part 1- Reality In Forty Verses (Ulladu Narpadu) : Supplement

Dear prasanth,   
Apart from quoting the Verse 17 of Anubandam in his Padamalai,   
Muruganar has written the following verses on the Verse 17 of the   
ULLadu Narpadu Anubandam: Verse 1706: The hearts of those who have not united with the state of  
omnipotent Lord, which is grace, will never attain fullness.   
Verse 235: Padam [God] questions: 'When the burden of this   
world, created by myself, is for me alone, why should you have   
thought?   
Verse 904: It is God who manages and protects the many worlds.   
The imagining Jivas, who are just a multitude of reflections,   
that they are bearing the burden of the world is farce.   
Bhagavan Ramana also gives these ideas in Who am I? and there,   
He tells about the steam-engine train and the traveller with a load example.   
Verse 231: Banish even the thought 'I am a fit instrument for Him'   
and remain still [summa iru].   
{Because even that thought is a burden for you.]   
Arunachala Siva.
