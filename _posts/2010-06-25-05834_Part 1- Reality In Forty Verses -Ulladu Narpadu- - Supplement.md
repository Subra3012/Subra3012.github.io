Reality in Forty Verses: Supplement   
 **Invocation**   
That which is the Support, the Soul, the Source, the Purpose and the Power of  
all this world, the Reality behind all this Appearance, That indeed exists.  
Let That, the Truth, abide in our Heart. (Yoga Vasishta, 8, v.12)   
 **The Text**   
 **1\. In the company of sages, attachment vanishes; and with attachment,  
illusion. Freed from illusion, one attains stability, and thence liberation  
while yet alive. Seek therefore the company of sages. (from Bhajagovindam, the  
Mohamudagaram Hymn, by Shankaracharya)**   
 **2\. Not by listening to preachers, nor by study of books,not by meritorious  
deeds nor by any other means can one attain that Supreme State, which is  
attainable only through association with the sages and the clear quest of the  
Self.(a verse from the Yoga Vasishta, 5 - 12 - v.17)**   
 **3\. When one has learned to love the company of sages,wherefore all these  
rules of discipline? When a pleasant, cool southern breeze is blowing, what  
need is there for a fan? (a verse from the Yoga Vasishta)**   
4\. Fever is overcome by the cool light of the moon;want, by the good wish-  
yielding tree; and sin by the Holy Ganges. Those three  fever and want and  
sin  all flee at   
the august sight of the peerless sage. (Subhashita Ratna Bhandargara, chapt.  
3, v. 6)   
5\. Holy rivers, which are only water, and idols, which are made of stone and  
clay, are not as mighty as the sages.For while they make one pure in course of  
countless days, the sages eyes by a mere glance purify at once. (from Srimad  
Bhagavatam, chapt. 48, v. 31, tenth canto)   
6\. Disciple: Who is God?   
Master: He who knows the mind.   
D: My Self, the Spirit, knows my mind.   
M: Therefore you are God; and also the sruti declares   
that there is only one God, the Knower.   
 **7\. M: By what light do you see?   
D: The sun by day, the lamp by night.   
M: By what light do you see these lights?   
D: The eye.   
M: By what light do you see the eye?   
D: The mind.   
M: By what light do you know the mind?   
D: My Self.   
M: You then are the Light of Lights.   
D: Yes, That I am.   
(from Ekasloki, by Shankaracharya)**   
8\. In the centre of the Heart-Cave there shines alone the one Brahman as the  
I, I, the Atman. Reach the Heart by diving deep in quest of the Self, or by  
controlling the mind with the breath, and stay established in the Atman.   
 **9\. In the lotus of the Heart is pure and changeless Consciousness in the  
form of the Self. When the ego is removed, this Consciousness of Self bestows  
liberation   
of soul. (Devikalottaram, v. 46)**   
 **10\. The body is like an earthen pot, inert. Because it has no  
consciousness of I, and because daily in bodiless sleep we touch our real  
nature, the body is not I. Then who is this I? Where is this I? In the  
Heart-cave of those that question thus,there shineth forth as I, Himself,  
the Lord Siva of Arunachala.**   
11\. Who is born? It is only he who asks Whence am I born? that is truly  
born in Brahman, the Prime Source. He indeed is born eternally; He is the Lord  
of saints; He is the ever-new. (On celebrating Sri Bhagavans jayanti))   
12\. Cast off the notion, This vile flesh am I, and seek the ceaseless bliss  
of Self. To seek the Self while cherishing this perishing flesh is like trying  
to cross a stream by clinging to a crocodile.   
13\. The way of charity, penance, sacrifice, dharma, yoga and bhakti; and the  
Goal of Heaven, Reality, Peace, Truth,Grace, Silence, Stability, Deathless  
Death, Knowledge,   
Renunciation, Liberation, Bliss  all this is only ceasing to think that the  
body is the Self.   
14\. What is action, or devotion, or union, or knowledge? It is to inquire,  
Whose is this action, or indifference, or separateness, or ignorance?  
Inquiring thus, the ego vanishes.To abide as the Self, wherein these eight  
have never been, this is True existence.   
15\. Not realizing that they themselves are moved by an energy not their own,  
some fools are busy seeking miraculous powers. Their antics are like the  
boasting of a cripple who says to his friends: If you raise me to my feet,  
these enemies are nothing before me.   
16\. Since the stilling of the mind is true liberation and miraculous powers  
are unattainable without an act of the mind,how can they whose mind is set on  
such powers enter the bliss of liberation which is the ending of all activity  
of the mind?   
 **17\. While God sustains the burden of the world, the spurious ego assumes  
its burden, grimacing like an image on a tower, seeming to support it. If the  
traveller in a carriage,which can carry any weight, does not lay his luggage  
down but carries it painfully on his head, whose is the fault?**   
18\. Between the two paps, below the chest, above the stomach, there are six  
organs of various colours. Of these,one, looking like a lily bud, is the  
Heart, at two digits distance to the right of the centre. (from Ashtanga  
Hridayam,Malayalam)   
19\. Its mouth is closed. Within its cavity is seated a heavy darkness, filled  
with all desires; all the great nerves are centred there; the home it is of  
breath, mind, light of knowledge. (from Ashtanga Hridayam, Malayalam)

Dear prasanth,   
Apart from quoting the Verse 17 of Anubandam in his Padamalai,   
Muruganar has written the following verses on the Verse 17 of the   
ULLadu Narpadu Anubandam: Verse 1706: The hearts of those who have not united with the state of  
omnipotent Lord, which is grace, will never attain fullness.   
Verse 235: Padam [God] questions: 'When the burden of this   
world, created by myself, is for me alone, why should you have   
thought?   
Verse 904: It is God who manages and protects the many worlds.   
The imagining Jivas, who are just a multitude of reflections,   
that they are bearing the burden of the world is farce.   
Bhagavan Ramana also gives these ideas in Who am I? and there,   
He tells about the steam-engine train and the traveller with a load example.   
Verse 231: Banish even the thought 'I am a fit instrument for Him'   
and remain still [summa iru].   
{Because even that thought is a burden for you.]   
Arunachala Siva.
