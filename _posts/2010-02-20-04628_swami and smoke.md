## a light reflection....

I came across this from some website, and thought its worth posting it here,   
It is impossible to know the taste of tea without first drinking it.   
Studying tea will not help.   
Meditating on tea will not help.   
Listening to others talk about tea will not help.   
Reading sutras about tea will not help.   
Smelling the aroma of tea will not help.   
Sitting blissfully in samahdi around tea will not help.   
Seeking tea in exotic countries will not help.   
Having profound insights about tea will not help.   
Opening the heart in deep life-changing ways will not help.   
Going inside a tea shop will not help.   
All of these things are mere confusion and delaying tactics.   
To know the taste of tea you must drink it. There is no other way.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear SLakshmi,   
Yes. In the same way, I think, when a large volume of incense was   
burnt or when arti was shown, Bhagavan Ramana said: "Okay. Show   
these to to your heart's content. But why not to that Kallu Swami (the   
stone image, in front of Mother's Temple? It will not object." This   
was in 1946. It happened. Today we have only the Kallu Swami but   
not Bhagavan Ramana in body. His living Presence is however definitely   
there. The Asramam has seen to it that no arti is shown or no incense   
is burnt even before that stone image!   
Arunachala Siva.

Doopam normally refers to a small wick dipped in ghee and shown   
to God in the home altar before actual camphor lighting.   
Deepam is a regular lamp, with oil or ghee.   
Dasangam is the one which is called Sambrani, the powder which   
is burnt on a coal fire.   
The words, Dasangam and Doopam are of course interchangeably used.   
Arunachala Siva.
