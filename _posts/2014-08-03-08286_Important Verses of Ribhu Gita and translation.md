A WORD ABOUT GURU VACHAKA KOVAI: I was earlier reading David Godman's Guru Vachaka Kovai several times and this  
book contains apart from   
prose meaning of verses along with connected incidents in Sri Bhagavan's life.  
It also gives a list of Bhagavan's   
Verse and other stray verses of Bhagavan included in Guru Vachaka Kovai. Then  
I read the original Tamizh verses   
of Guru Vachaka Kovai and it delighted me more. The work is the summum bonum  
of Sri Bhagavan's teachings   
nicely versified by Muruganar.   
I thought of giving the Tamizh original verses (1254 + Bhagavan's verses) and  
also the translation in blank verse by   
Prof. K. Swaminathan.   
At the rate of about 15 verses per day and their English translation, it took  
me about 80+ days to post them. I am   
overjoyed in Bhagavan's Grace who made this task possible.   
All glory to Sri Bhagavan.   
All glory to His foremost devotee Sri Mugavaik KaNNa Muruganar.   
Arunachala Siva.

Verse 44.51. of Ribhu Gita: சத்திய ஞானானந்த சொரூபம் போற்றி   
 சகல பரி பூரணமாம் சொரூபம் போற்றி   
நித்திய ஞானானந்த சொரூபம் போற்றி   
 நிரஞ்சன நிர்க் குணமான சொரூபம் போற்றி   
இத்துவித லேசமிலா சொரூபம் போற்றி   
 ஏக சிதாகாய பர சொரூபம் போற்றி   
அத்துவித மான பர சொரூபம் போற்றி   
 அகண்டமதாம் பர சொரூபம் போற்றி.   
Arunachala Siva.

Verse 44.51. of Ribhu Gita: Glory to the Supreme Nature, which is Truth Knowledge Bliss,   
Glory to the Supreme Nature, which is complete and perfectly full,   
Glory to the Supreme Nature, which is eternal Knowledge Bliss,   
Glory to the Supreme Nature which is taint-less and attribute-less.   
Glory to the Supreme Nature, which is without a trace of duality.   
Glory to the Supreme Nature, which is one expanse of Consciousness.   
Glory to the Supreme Nature, which is non dual.   
Glory to the Supreme Nature, which is undivided.   
(Tr. Dr. H. Ramamoorthy)   
With this Ribhu Gita, condensed version of 122 verses concluded.   
Glory to Ulaganatha Swami who composed this treatise!   
Glory to Sri Bhagavan who recommended this treatise!   
Arunachala Siva.   
I am adding one more verse praising Siva Nataraja, (this praising is there at  
the end of every chapter, but I am   
giving only that in the last chapter.

This is the last verse of the treatise I am posting, additionally, which  
salutes the Lord Siva, who is consort of Ambika, Devi: Verse 44.52. of Ribhu Gita: தேசிகன் தெரிவித்த திறப் படி   
 தீரமாய் நிதித்தியாசம் புரிந்தால்   
ஈசன் நல் அருள் பெற்றவர் முத்தியை   
 எய்தலாம் என முன்பு விளம்பி மற்   
றேசிலா இந்த நூலின் மகத்துவம்   
 யாவும் ஓதி இதனை முடித்திடல்   
ஆசிலா ஆனந்த தாண்டவம் ஆடும் நம்   
 அம்பிகேசன் அகண்ட சொரூபமே.   
Arunachala Siva.
