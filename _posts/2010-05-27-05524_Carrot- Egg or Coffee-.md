**PRACTICAL VEDANTA PART II (Delivered in London, 12th November 1896)   
Give up the small for the Infinite, give up small enjoyments for infinite  
bliss.** It is all yours, for the Impersonal includes the Personal. So God is  
Personal and Impersonal at the same time.   
And Man, the Infinite, Impersonal Man, is manifesting Himself as person. We  
the infinite have limited ourselves, as it were, into small parts. The Vedanta  
says that Infinity is our true nature; it will never vanish, it will abide for  
ever. But we are limiting ourselves by our Karma, which like a chain round our  
necks has dragged us into this limitation. Break that chain and be free.  
Trample law under your feet. There is no law in human nature, there is no  
destiny, no fate. How can there be law in infinity? Freedom is its watchword.  
**Freedom is its nature, its birthright.** Be free, and then have any number  
of personalities you like. Then we will play like the actor who comes upon the  
stage and plays the part of a beggar. Contrast him with the actual beggar  
walking in the streets. The scene is, perhaps, the same in both cases, the  
words are, perhaps, the same, but yet what difference! The one enjoys his  
beggary while the other is suffering misery from it. And what makes this  
difference? The one is free and the other is bound.   
The actor knows his beggary is not true, but that he has assumed it for play,  
while the real beggar thinks that it is his too familiar state and that he has  
to bear it whether he wills it or not. This is the law. **So long as we have  
no knowledge of our real nature, we are beggars, jostled about by every force  
in nature; and made slaves of by everything in nature; we cry all over the  
world for help, but help never comes to us; we cry to imaginary beings, and  
yet it never comes.** But still we hope help will come, and thus in weeping,  
wailing, and hoping, one life is passed, and the same play goes on and on.   
So are our lives spent in hoping, hoping, hoping, which never comes to an end.  
**Give up hope, says the Vedanta. Why should you hope? You have everything,  
nay, you are everything. What are you hoping for? If a king goes mad, and runs  
about trying to find the king of his country, he will never find him, because  
he is the king himself. He may go through every village and city in his own  
country, seeking in every house, weeping and wailing, but he will never find  
him, because he is the king himself. It is better that we know we are God and  
give up this fool 's search after Him; and knowing that we are God we become  
happy and contented. Give up all these mad pursuits, and then play your part  
in the universe, as an actor on the stage.**

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Carrot, Egg or Coffee?

A young woman went to her mother and told her about her life and how things  
were so hard for her. She did not know how she was going to make it and wanted  
to give up. She was tired of fighting and struggling. It seemed as one problem  
was solved a new one arose.   
Her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water. In the  
first, she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs and the last she  
placed ground coffee beans. She let them sit and boil without saying a word.   
In about twenty minutes she turned off the burners. She fished the carrots out  
and placed them in a bowl. She pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl.  
Then she ladled the coffee out and placed it in a bowl. Turning to her  
daughter, she asked, "Tell me what do you see?"   
"Carrots, eggs, and coffee," she replied.   
She brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She did and noted  
that they got soft.She then asked her to take an egg and break it.   
After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg.   
Finally, she asked her to sip the coffee. The daughter smiled, as she tasted  
its rich aroma. The daughter then asked. "What's the point, mother?"   
Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same adversity--  
boiling water--but each reacted differently.   
The carrot went in strong, hard and unrelenting. However after being subjected  
to the boiling water, it softened and became weak. The egg had been fragile.  
Its thin outer shell had protected its liquid interior. But, after sitting  
through the boiling water, its inside became hardened.   
The ground coffee beans were unique, however. After they were in the boiling  
water they had changed the water.   
"Which are you?" she asked her daughter. "When adversity knocks on your door,  
how do you respond? Are you a carrot, an egg, or a coffee bean?"   
Think of this: Which am I?   
Am I the carrot that seems strong, but with pain and adversity, do I wilt and  
become soft and lose my strength?   
Am I the egg that starts with a malleable heart, but changes with the heat?  
Did I have a fluid spirit, but after a death, a breakup, a financial hardship  
or some other trial, have I become hardened and stiff?   
Does my shell look the same, but on the inside am I bitter and tough with a  
stiff spirit and a hardened heart?   
Or am I like the coffee bean? The bean actually changes the hot water, the  
very circumstance that brings the pain. When the water gets hot, it releases  
the fragrance and flavor. If you are like the bean, when things are at their  
worst, you get better and change the situation around you.   
When the hours are the darkest and trials are their greatest do you elevate to  
another level?   
 **How do you handle Adversity? ARE YOU A CARROT, AN EGG, OR A COFFEE BEAN?   
Don't tell GOD how big your storm is. Tell the storm how big your GOD is!**

Dear prasanth,   
Dwell in the flame of sorrow. The end will be wonderful. Do not   
grudge about adversities. Once there was a priest of Mathrubhuteswara Temple  
in the Asramam. His legs had some   
serious problem. And he could not move out of his bed. But he   
never grieved for it. Sri Ganesan went to see him. He said: "Mama (Uncle), You kaal (leg) has become like this. What a pity!"   
The priest replied: Ganesa! I am not worried, why are you worried?   
Only kaal (means also, one quarter) is bad but mukkaal (three quarters, mind  
and thoughts and meditation) is good. I am thankful to Bhagavan Ramana for  
this grace." This is the best form of surrender.   
Arunachala Siva.

Well said Subramanian Garu.   
Kamakshi,the daughter of the famous compiler of Talks, Munagala Venkatramaiah  
health deteriorated and she was diagonized to have bone cancer. On seeing her  
condition Sri V. Sundara Ramanan of the Asramam said with flowing tears: "O  
Auntie! why has Bhagavan let you down like this?" Eyes flashing and with  
sudden energy flowing Kamakshi responded: "How dare you say Bhagavan has at  
any time failed to take care of me?" She passed away after sometime.
