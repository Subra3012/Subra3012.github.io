## Ego and Cosmic Consciousness coexisting

Paramahansa Yogananda describes nirvikalpa samadhi as follows: In the most advanced state [of samadhi], nirvikalpa samadhi, the soul realizes  
itself and Spirit as one. The ego consciousness, the soul consciousness, and  
the ocean of Spirit are seen all existing together. It is the state of  
simultaneously watching the ocean of Spirit and the waves of creation. The  
individual no longer sees himself as a "John Smith" related to a particular  
environment; he realizes that the ocean of Spirit has become not only the wave  
of John Smith but also the waves of all other lives. In nirvikalpa the soul is  
simultaneously conscious of Spirit within and creation without. The divine man  
in the nirvikalpa state may even engage in performance of his material duties  
with no loss of inner God-union.   
[I was very happy to discover this saying.   
And then I discovered this wonderful poem by Yoganandaji]   
 **Samadhi**   
Vanished the veils of light and shade,   
Lifted every vapor of sorrow,   
Sailed away all dawns of fleeting joy,   
Gone the dim sensory mirage.   
Love, hate, health, disease, life, death,   
Perished these false shadows on the screen of duality.   
Waves of laughter, scyllas of sarcasm, melancholic whirlpools,   
Melting in the vast sea of bliss.   
The storm of maya stilled   
By magic wand of intuition deep.   
The universe, forgotten dream, subconsciously lurks,   
Ready to invade my newly wakened memory divine.   
I live without the cosmic shadow,   
But it is not, bereft of me;   
As the sea exists without the waves,   
But they breathe not without the sea.   
Dreams, wakings, states of deep turiya sleep,   
Present, past, future, no more for me,   
But ever-present, all-flowing I, I, everywhere.   
Planets, stars, stardust, earth,   
Volcanic bursts of doomsday cataclysms,   
Creation's molding furnace,   
Glaciers of silent x-rays, burning electron floods,   
Thoughts of all men, past, present, to come,   
Every blade of grass, myself, mankind,   
Each particle of universal dust,   
Anger, greed, good, bad, salvation, lust,   
I swallowed, transmuted all   
Into a vast ocean of blood of my own one Being!   
Smoldering joy, oft-puffed by meditation   
Blinding my tearful eyes,   
Burst into immortal flames of bliss,   
Consumed my tears, my frame, my all.   
Thou art I, I am Thou,   
Knowing, Knower, Known, as One!   
Tranquilled, unbroken thrill, eternally living, ever new peace!   
Enjoyable beyond imagination of expectancy, samadhi bliss!   
Not a mental chloroform   
Or unconscious state without wilful return,   
Samadhi but extends my conscious realm   
Beyond the limits of the mortal frame   
To farthest boundary of eternity   
 **Where I, the Cosmic Sea,   
Watch the little ego floating in me**.   
The sparrow, each grain of sand, fall not without my sight.   
All space like an iceberg floats within my mental sea.   
Colossal Container, I, of all things made.   
By deeper, longer, thirsty, guru-given meditation   
Comes this celestial samadhi   
Mobile murmurs of atoms are heard,   
The dark earth, mountains, vales, lo! molten liquid!   
Flowing seas change into vapors of nebulae!   
Aum blows upon the vapors, opening wondrously their veils,   
Oceans stand revealed, shining electrons,   
Till, at last sound of the cosmic drum,   
Vanish the grosser lights into eternal rays   
Of all-pervading bliss.   
 **From joy I came, for joy I live, in sacred joy I melt**.   
Ocean of mind, I drink all creation's waves.   
Four veils of solid, liquid, vapor, light,   
Lift aright.   
Myself, in everything, enters the Great Myself.   
Gone forever, fitful, flickering shadows of mortal memory.   
Spotless is my mental sky, below, ahead, and high above.   
Eternity and I, one united ray.   
A tiny bubble of laughter, I   
Am become the Sea of Mirth Itself.   
I was thrilled by reading this poem.   
Victory to Paramahansaji.   
And homage to the Innermost Bliss.   
Om Shanti...

## Re:[1]Cosmic Consciousness

Sri Aurobindo writes about the Cosmic Consciousness: The cosmic consciousness is that in which the limits of the ego, personal  
mind and body disappear and one becomes aware of a cosmic vastness which is or  
filled by a cosmic spirit and aware also of a direct play of cosmic forces,  
universal mind forces, universal life forces, universal energies of Matter,  
universal overmind forces. But one does not become aware of all these  
together; **the opening of the cosmic consciousness is usually progressive. It  
is not that the ego, the body, the personal mind disappear but one feels them  
as only a small part of oneself**. One begins to feel others too as part of  
oneself or varied repetitions of oneself, the same Self modified by Nature in  
other bodies. Or, at the least, as living in the larger universal self which  
is henceforth one's own greater reality. All things in fact begin to change  
their nature and appearance; one's whole experience of the world is radically  
different from that of those who are shut up in their personal selves. **One  
begins to know things by a different kind of experience, more direct, not  
depending on the external mind and the senses**. It is not that the  
possibility of errors disappears, for that cannot be so long as mind of any  
kind is one's instrument for transcribing knowledge, but their is a new, vast  
and new way of experiencing, seeing, knowing, contacting things; and the  
confines of knowledge can be rolled back to an almost unmeasurable degree. The  
thing one has to be in guard in cosmic consciousness is the play of a  
magnified ego, the vaster attacks of the hostile forces -- for they too are  
part of the cosmic consciousness -- and the attempt of the Cosmic Illusion to  
prevent the growth of the soul into the cosmic Truth. These are the things one  
has to learn from experience; mental teaching or explanation is quite  
insufficient. To enter safely into cosmic consciousness and to safely pass  
through it, it is necessary to have a strong central unegoistic sincerity and  
to have the psychic being, with its divination of truth and unfaltering  
orientation towards the Divine, already in front of the Nature.   
Om Shanti. ..

Dear silentgreen,   
One SRK Math explains the Cosmic Consciousness, by an   
incident in the life of Swami Vivekananada. On a night,   
Swami Vivekananda could not sleep and he was walking   
restless inside the Math. The disciples were wondering but   
could not ask him. Next morning, they asked him. Swami   
said: "There is something happening somewhere in the world.   
That is why I became restless, without sleep last night." The   
papers around 7 am brought the news that there was a   
severe earthquake in South America where thousands had   
perished!   
Arunachala Siva.
