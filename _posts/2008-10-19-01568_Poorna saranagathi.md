Once Bhagawan sat on the Siva side of Arunachala mountain and is in a state  
of self absorption with his eyes open.Some miscreants came over there   
to steal tamarind fruits from the tree which belongs to another person.They  
collected huge amounts of tamarind in a hurry and before going out one   
of them observed Bhagawan with his eyes open and he felt that Bhagawan is the  
only person to witness the theft and it is better to remove his eyes   
so that no body will trace their theft and he ordered one of his accomplice to  
destroy the eyes of Bhagawan.Bhagawan is aware of all these things but   
he did not react to the situation.The person who is expected to destroy  
Bhagawan's eyes came very near to Bhagawan and observed his eyes and he   
felt that Bhagawan is already blind because his eyes looked vacant like that  
of a blind man with no response to anything that is seeable and he reported  
the same   
to his friend.Then they ran away without harming Bhagawan.Bhagawan stood by  
his teaching that whatever is going to happen will happen to the body   
according to prarabdha and whatever is destained not to happen will not happen  
under any circumstances.Such strong conviction is possible only for those   
with Poorna saranagathi.

Dear Dr. Raju, Yes. I think, (whether it is in the same story or   
some other story), someone came to drop cactus milk into His   
eyes, to make Him blind. He did not move. Then they left without   
doing that evil thing.   
Arunachala Siva.
