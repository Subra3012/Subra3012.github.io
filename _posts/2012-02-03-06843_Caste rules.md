Why does Hinduism have castes?   
What did Bhagavan say about this?

Dear Jyoti,   
Caste systems are prevalent right from Vedic times. The original purpose of  
caste system is division of labor. Over a period of time,   
it came to one caste (brahmins) ruling over the other castes.   
Sri Bhagavan was above all caste differences. Self has no caste and so a Self  
realized Jnani.   
However, since the visitors / devotees had still such feeling of differences,  
He made the brahmins and other caste people to   
sit in two different rows for breakfast, lunch and diner in the dining hall.  
He sat facing both the rows on the sides. Even when   
Westerners came, for their first lunch or dinner, He made them sit with them.   
His views are: Talks No. 433: The castes relate to bodies and not to the Self. The Self is Bliss. To realize  
Bliss one realizes the Self. No need to worry oneself   
about caste etc.,   
Talks No. 238: Is the discovery of the Self dependent on the observations of caste rules? Or  
should we flout them?   
Sri Bhagavan: Not in the beginning., Observe them to start with. Caste rules  
serve as a check on the vagaries of the mind.   
It is thus purified.   
Talks No, 507: Devotee: You are a Mahatma. You cannot admit castes. But how do the people  
here enforce such distinctions?   
Maharshi: Did I tell you that I am a Jnani or a Mahatma? You are saying it  
yourself. Nor did I make a grievance of this   
caste affair.   
It is you who say it (that caste distinctions are painful). There are  
countries where there are no such distinctions of caste.   
Are they free from trouble? There are wars, internecine struggle etc., Why do  
you not remedy the evils there?. ....Differences   
are always there. There are not only human beings, but also animals, plants  
etc., The state of affairs cannot be helped.....You need   
not notice these distinctions. There is diversity in the world. A unity runs  
through the diversity. The Self is the same in all. There   
is no difference in the Self. All the differences are external and  
superficial. You find out the Unity and be happy.   
Arunachala Siva.

Post Maharshi period, brahmins were largely isolated, denied the equal  
rights in jobs and education and off late even in temples they have lost their  
pooja rights which they inherited for generations in the past.   
So modern day 21st century status is this: caste based partiality affects  
brahmins only to a large extent. In the name of castes, they are again and  
again pulled into convtreversial affairs and being ridiculed.

Dear Krishnan,   
I fully agree with you. Mahatma Gandhi tried his best to remove caste  
distinctions. In Madurai and other places, the temple entry   
of Harijans took place, after great struggle. Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni, in  
his own days called Harijans and gave them mantra-   
upadesa. In post Independent India, caste distinctions were abolished by law.  
But what really happened? The new sets of classes,   
came into force. Forward Class, Backward Class, Other Backward Class,  
Minority quota -- all came into force. Mandal Commission   
created a pelmel. What is the result of all these? Brahmins were ignored in  
all spheres. Whether it is educational institutions,   
workstations, Railways, Central Govt. offices, State Govt. offices,  
everywhere, brahmins were ignored, with out selection. Perhaps these new  
generations of brahmins are suffering for the sins of their earlier  
generations.   
Arunachala Siva.

Perhaps the biggest caste problem is between the **" Jivatma"** and **"  
Paramatma"**

Hinduism, as you know is very ancient. It was a way of life called Sanatana  
Dharma and the name Hinduism was coined after the advent of Britishers.   
Factors of Production is essential for development of any society. These are  
Land, Labour, Capital, and Enterprise,.This is valid even today.In ancient  
India, the Shudras looked after Labour, Vaishyas controlled Capital, Brahmins  
represented Enterprise. Apart from these, Sovereignity -the King and his clan  
-Kshatriyas governed Land and Army. Birth determined castes. All went on  
well,until the Britishers arrived. They drafted the Brahmins in large numbers  
to assist the Executive and paid attractive compensations.Others also  
clamoured for posts in Govt.   
Post Independence, India chose democratic republic, vesting powers on elected  
representative.Quanatiy-numerical majaority has become the deciding factor  
and Quality has been sidelined. In this process chaos have emerged and caste  
system has become a scapegoat.   
All the strength and weakness of caste are now in built in various classes.   
Equality can never be   
achieved by abolition of caste.   
Bhagavan does not belong to this world at all and he is Self, beyond names and  
forms. His view related to this subject is differences will persist in this  
world and remain like different sizes of fingers on hand.

Brahmins represented enterprise?   
That is a surprise for me, my idea was that Brahmins should not mix into  
worldy matters at all, but study the Vedas, teach the Vedas & function as  
priests.

Wasn't the system allready corrupt before the British came?   
I am not from England nor from India so perhaps I am wrong in my belief that  
the British rules also has done some good to India, especial the women.   
But this is a question for another thread.

Dear Jyothi,   
Chanting, teaching Vedas and doing other religious activities are daily  
duties for Brahmins.Some of them no doubt took it up as vocation. Equally  
large Brahmins played a dominant role as Advisors, Planners , Experts in  
various departments in a kingdom as well as in social institutions.All these  
elements can be termed as Enterprise.   
After the advent of British, the social fabric changed significantly.certainly  
more drastically than before it was in Moghul or other periods.   
No doubt we gratefully acknowledge Britishers contributions in building up a  
modern India.Their impact on caste system,however, is adverse. Thats all.

AN EXCERPT FROM LORD MACAULAY'S ADDRESS TO THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT, 2 FEBRUARY,  
1835   
 **" I have travelled across the length and breadth of India and I have not  
seen one person who is a beggar, who is a thief, such wealth I have seen in  
this country, such high moral values, people of such calibre, that I do not  
think we would ever conquer this country, unless we break the very backbone of  
this nation, which is her spiritual and cultural heritage, and, therefore, I  
propose that we replace her old and ancient education system, her culture, for  
if the Indians think that all that is foreign and English is good and greater  
than their own, they will lose their selfesteem, their native culture and they  
will become what we want them, a truly dominated nation."**   
Salutations to Bhagavan

The fact that Brahmins represented enterprises means only they were ministers  
in King's courts (like   
Saint Manikkavachagar, who was a brahmin) and advisors (like Chanyakya in  
Mourya period). They   
were doing these apart from their core work of chanting Vedas and teaching  
Vedas. They were not demanding \   
any huge salaries, one should also remember. Chanakya was living in a small  
cottage.

As a matter of reflection, such division of Varnas in Sanathana Dharma can be  
compared to the Military Hirarchy, starting from Lieutenant then Captain,  
Major, Lieutenant Colonel, Colonel,. .. so on till the General.   
It will be surpriing to really see the kind of respects the hirarchy pays to  
their seniors based on ranks. I have seen the kind of humbleness with which  
the junior conducts with his superior, infact, even lower cadre official bends  
down below to his superior while handing over something to his superiror, now  
what to say about this? those who have acquaintance with Military may know,  
for a shallow person, it could seem abuse of seniority or hierarchy, but only  
the uniform discounts people from thinking thus and people who talk ill about  
Varna fail to see the real essense. But we don't call it Caste problem. It is  
a carefully devised system for some very obvious reasons!   
We cannot go about preaching that all are equal and that everybody is one and  
the same. The Varna system issues have deteriorated only due to shallow  
thinking human beings.   
Our Sages who set the Varna system could not be so shallow, so as to have  
deliberately made the Brahmins the highest in the varna. There is no Higher or  
Lower in Varna. Sages who talk about Varna are Vasishta, Apasthamba,  
Boudhayana, who are all reputed to be Jivanmuktas and some also were part of  
the Sapta Rishi's.   
We usually go by the half baked politicians who have carefully stamped the  
caste for their votes, and, Caste as deviced by oliticians is here to stay.  
While the wise Varna system devised by Sages is no longer relevant.

Dear Nagaraj and others,   
Sri Sankara says in his bhashyam: If you cannot attain brahma jnana through a  
brahmin, in brahmin's street, go to a Chandala   
(outcaste) if he is a brahmajnani and learn from him. What is the meaning?  
Atma Jnana is important. Atma Jnana can be sought   
even from a chandala if he is a brahma jnani. Sri Sankara's Maneesha  
Panchakam also highlights this fact.   
The varnas were made by ancient Rishis for a purpose. The purpose lost its  
moorings over a time. Caste system has been abolished.   
But today it is seen in a different form. That is all.   
Arunachala Siva.
