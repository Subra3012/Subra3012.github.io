Once it was an unusually cold winter and that particular day was   
the coldest. Manavasi Ramaswamy Iyer had two shirts made locally,   
because he wanted Bhagavan Ramana to wear them for the biting cold. He had no  
courage to tell Bhagavan and he placed the shirts   
on the stool infront of the sofa when Bhagavan had gone for the stoll.   
On return, Bhagavan Ramana looking at the stool, asked: "What is this?" Iyer  
murmured inaudibly: "Bhagavan, it is very cold outside...." Bhagavan Ramana  
asked immediately: "Did I complain about the cold?" Iyer further said: "No,  
no Bhagavan! I thought Bhagavan should wear a shirt to protect Himself."   
Bhagavan said: No, take them away! When Iyer was still hesitating,   
Bhagavan Ramana said: " I already wear five shirts. Is sixth one   
necessary?"   
(Bhagavan meant pancha kosas.)

Hi Subramanian.R, would you explain what pancha kosas is. I still don't  
undestand it.   
Paul.

Dear Paul,   
The five kosas are five sheaths or covers with which our body is   
made up of. The first is Annamaya Kosa, the food sheath. The   
second is Prana maya kosa, breath sheath. The third is manomaya   
kosa, the mind sheath. The fourth is Vijnana maya kosa, the knowledge or  
intellect sheath. The fifth is Anandamaya kosa, the   
bliss sheath. These need not be imagined as one within another.   
Bhagavan Ramana has explained that these are all inter oven, like   
a hand kerchief. The hand kerchief has got a thickness, a colour, a texture,  
a size, and then the smell, depending upon the perfume one   
uses. All the five sheaths are interoven as all the above things are   
interoven in the handkerchief.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Paul,   
Actually if you look into literature, there are many English writers who have  
presented the tenets of Hinduism and its core principles in their works. Just  
to name a few, TS Elliot, Wordsworth and Shakespeare have had the great ideals  
of Vedanta and it reflected in their works. What this proves is that the  
Grandeur i.e. the Truth is one and the same to all.   
Abraham Maslow, American Psychologist, the Propounder of "Self Actualization"  
in his paper "Hierarchy of needs" on Human Motivation has included his  
observation on Humans innate curiosity and needs.   
Its amazing that even deep western thinkers have the ideals of Vedanta even  
without their prior knowledge of the Vedas or Upanishads. You can clearly  
observe in the works of Paulo Coelho that he has covered all the four aspects  
of Yogas of Vedanta viz. Karma, Bhakti, Jnana Yoga. His most famous book is  
Alchemist. Many writers have had the idea of Advaita by their deep thinking  
and reflected that in the works without actually referring to Vedanta. Truth  
is eternal, the same for everyone.   
Maslow puts it this way, every human has this Hierarchy of needs in the  
process where one is Self Actualized or in our terms Self Realisation: Physiological needs - These are the most basic human needs which are important  
for sustenance   
like food, water, warmth, shelter, sleep etc. Maslow argued that unless  
physiological needs are   
satisfied to a degree, no other motivating factor can work.   
Safety or Security needs - These are needs to be free of physical danger and  
emotional harm like   
the fear of losing a job, property, food or shelter. It relates to security,  
protection and stability in   
the personal events of everyday life.   
Social Needs - These are needs for love, affection and belongingness and  
social acceptance.   
People are social beings and try to satisfy their needs for acceptance and  
friendship.   
Esteem - Once people's social needs are satisfied, they look for esteem  
(reputation). This need   
produces such satisfaction as power, prestige status and self confidence. It  
includes both internal   
esteem factors like self-respect, autonomy, achievements and external esteem  
factors such as   
recognition and attention as well as personal sense of competence. (Source)   
Self actualization - This need is the drive to become what one is capable of  
becoming. It's the   
need to grow and use abilities to the fullest potential. It includes growth  
and self-fulfillment by   
achieving one's potential to accomplish something   
This is just a brief information. A person, who does not have any idea about  
Vedanta, of the Soul, of Self Realisation is able to understand the same  
essence as we do in a complete different way. The names may not really match  
exactly to the Vedanta Terms but we can see their effort towards Self  
Realisation.   
Similarly,   
The Pancha Koshas can be roughly understood as the 5 Needs of Humans, The  
'Sheath' or 'Koshas' are actually called 'cells' in Human Body,  
Psychologically we can take it as our Physiological needs. The Sheath or the  
invisible layers of our body needs to be nourished systematically.   
The Pancha Koshas or the 5 Sheath's are: Annamaya Kosha - Physiological needs (Food Nourishment)   
Praanamaya Kosha - Safety or Security needs - (Energy)   
Manomaya Kosha - Social Needs - (Emotions)   
Vijnanamaya Kosha - Esteem (Ego)   
Anandamaya Kosha - Self actualization (Brahman)   
This appears in the Taittiriya Upanishad which gives the different stages of a  
Human towards the Goal Ananda - The Supreme Bliss or Sat Chit Ananda.   
You can get a clear picture on this by the link provided by Munagala.   
Being born as a Human being, the most primordial and basic need to to keep it  
going is to fuel it. therefore every human begins his journey into eternity  
from the Anna Maya Kosha or the Food Sheath. Here the Human primarily needs  
Food and Water for survival. His needs are limited to working out his way for  
his Food.   
The Second need is energy. Praana simply means Energy. From the need for Food  
originates the energy. They are interrelated to each other. This is primarily  
signified by our breath. Our breath is our basic energy. The Nadis or the  
Nerves carry out the energy to all parts of the body to different organs to  
keep the body going. Here the Humans need is to develop the Energies in his  
Body.   
Thirdly, Every human develops emotion. Emotional bonding with others and  
himself. Here Human tries to understand whatever is happening to him. He  
develops an Emotive ability in determining and fulfilling all his emotions.  
The Love and understanding the other, the need for a company, to Co exist.  
According to Scriptures there are supposed to be Nava Rasas of 9 types of  
emotions. Here Human evolves himself in the Nava Rasas.   
Fourthly, Vijnanamaya Kosha is Mental level, It clearly signifies the  
Intellectual abilities, discrimination, here the Human is really able to  
understand and appreciate the Truth! He begins to face the reality face to  
face. Here the Ego 'I' is more dominant than ever. In all the previous stages  
above, the HUman is not aware of even His Ego. It is only when he is traveling  
in Vijnanamaya Kosha that he is able to learn about himself the Ego in Him.  
Most of us reside in Vijnanamaya Kosha fluctuating between other Koshas. Here  
in when the Discriminative ability is Prominent.   
Ananda Maya Kosha is the Sheath of Bliss or Sat Chit Ananda Here Perfection is  
achieved or what is called the Self Actualization by Maslow. This is the most  
Natural State of the Human or the Soul. There is no more needs to be  
fulfilled. ABsolute Completeness. Brahman.   
These are the invisible Sheath or layers or cloths that cover the Soul or  
Atman or Brahman. When different needs are met, it discards its layers one by  
one and finally in Vijnanamaya Kosha or Self Esteem when the Ego Drops the  
Brahman is only to be found and is COMPLETE. and it has no more layers or  
Sheath to itself and it only IS.   
AL Tennyson wrote - God fulfills Himself in many ways, lest one good custom  
should corrupt the world.   
Marshall McLuhan, a Canadean Philosopher coined in the Term "The world is a  
Global Village"   
In the Vedas we have this idea from time immemorial "Vasdeiva Kutumbakam" The  
world world in one family   
"Ekam Sat Vipraha bahudha vadanti" from The Rig Veda   
There is but one God, learned scholars call this God by different names   
"Sarve amritasya putrah"   
We are all the children of God

Dear Munagala, Subramanian.R and Nagaraj, thank-you for taking the time to  
clarify the meaning of pancha kosas. Your explanations have been very helpful.  
I can now smile at the humour of the story as well   
paul.

Dear vinita,   
The gross body is made up of seven dhatus. Sapta is seven in   
Sanskrit. The dhatus can be roughly translated as "components".   
Arthur Osborne uses the word "humours". These are --   
1\. skin   
2\. flesh   
3\. blood   
4\. nerves   
5\. fat (cholosterol)   
6\. veins   
7\. bones   
Bhagavan Ramana says this in Who am I? to Sivaprakasam Pillai at   
the age of 21!   
He also mentions five Jnana indriyas, five cognitive organs. These are --   
1\. Hearing (ears)   
2\. Touch (skin)   
3\. Sight (eyes)   
4\. Taste (tongue)   
5\. Smell (nose)   
He also mentions five Karma Indriyas, five conative organs. These are --   
1\. Speech (mouth)   
2\. Locomotion (legs)   
3\. Grasping (hands)   
4\. Excretion (anus)   
5\. Procreation (genitals)   
There are five pranas, five vital airs. These are -   
1\. Prana   
2\. Apana   
3\. Vyana   
4\. Udhana   
5\. Samana   
Sri Sankara's Viveka Choodamani, also mentions about these.   
Arunachala Siva.

thanks for your response, subramanianji.   
though i had heard of the five indriyas...sapta datus were a mystery to me.   
it gives a lot more meaning to the nirvana shatkam of adi shankracharya...   
Nirvana Shatkam   
By Adi Sankaracharya, Translated by P. R. Ramachander   
Mano budhyahankara chithaa ninaham,   
Na cha srothra jihwe na cha graana nethrer,   
Na cha vyoma bhoomir na thejo na vayu,   
Chidananada Roopa Shivoham, Shivoham.   
Neither am I mind, nor intelligence,   
Nor ego, nor thought,   
Nor am I ears or the tongue or the nose or the eyes,   
Nor am I earth or sky or air or the light,   
I am Shiva, I am Shiva, of nature knowledge and bliss   
Na cha praana sangno na vai pancha vaayuh,   
Na vaa saptha dhathur na va pancha kosa,   
Na vak pani padam na chopastha payu,   
Chidananada Roopa Shivoham, Shivoham.

Dear soham3,   
Is there anything other than Brahman. It is everywhere, in everplace and in  
every   
point of time and transcending even all these. It is Poornam, the Complete.
