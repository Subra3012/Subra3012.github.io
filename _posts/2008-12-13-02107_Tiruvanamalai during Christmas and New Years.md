Dear members,   
We consider visiting Tiruvanamalai sometime between Dec 20th till early  
January.   
We are familiar with the fact that Tiruvanamalai is becoming more a more  
pupular with westren visitors.   
How busy is it during this periond? If so, would you recommend on a different  
time?   
Thanks!   
With Metta.   
Bill
