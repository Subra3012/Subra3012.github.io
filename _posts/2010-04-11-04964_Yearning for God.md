## Yearning for God

The core message of Bhagavan is to find "Who am I?" through Self-Enquiry and  
this is illustrated by the death experience of Bhagavan.   
Similarly, the core message of Sri Ramakrishna is Yearning for God which is  
illustrated by his own intense yearning in his early life.   
\- Describing the days he passed in intense yearning for God, the Master said: " _As I was perfectly unmindful of cleaning the body at that time, the hairs  
grew long and got matted of themselves, being smeared with dirt and dust. When  
I used to sit in meditation, the body used to become stiff and motionless like  
a stock through intense concentration of mind, and birds, taking it to be an  
inert substance, came freely, perched on the head, and pecked into the matted  
hair in search of food. Sometimes I used to feel so intensely the pangs of  
separation from God, that in great bitterness I rubbed my face on the earth;  
often it used to get lacerated and bleed. And in meditation, prayer and other  
devotional practices, the days used to fly away so quickly that I was not  
conscious of it. At dusk, when the approach of night was announced by the  
ringing of bells and the blowing of conches from the temple, I used to be  
reminded that the day had passed and the night had set in. With this  
consciousness a frenzy of despair would seize my soul, and I would throw  
myself on the ground and rub my face to it, crying loudly, "Mother, a day has  
passed; still Thou hast not appeared before me!" A gnawing anguish used to  
torment my soul, and those who saw me like that, writhing in agony, thought  
that I was suffering from colic pain_".   
\- I used to pray to the Divine Mother in this way: " _O Mother Who art the  
embodiment of bliss, Thou must reveal Thyself to me._ " And sometimes I would  
pray: " _O Lord of the meek! O Lord of the humble! Am I outside Thy universe?  
I have neither knowledge, nor devotion, nor merit of austerities. I know  
nothing. O Lord, in Thy infinite mercy Thou must vouchsafe Thy vision to me._  
"   
\- " _O Mother Divine! I want no honour from men, I want no pleasures of the  
flesh, only let my soul flow into Thee as the permanent confluence of the  
Ganges and the Jamuna. Mother, I am without Bhakti, without Yoga, I am poor  
and friendless, and I want no one 's praise; only let my mind dwell always at  
Thy lotus feet._"   
\- " _O Mother, I am the Yantra (the instrument), Thou art the Yantri (the  
mover); I am the room, Thou art the tenant; I am the sheath, Thou art the  
sword; I am the chariot, Thou art the charioteer. I do as Thou makest me do; I  
speak as Thou makest me speak; I behave as Thou within me behavest; not "I",  
not "I", but "Thou_".   
\- We heard from the Master that after the regular service was completed he  
would continue his worship of Her by singing devotional songs of Ramprasad and  
other mystics. His heart filled with emotion as he sang those songs with  
exuberant devotion. He thought: " _Ramprasad and other devotees had the vision  
of the Divine Mother. One can definitely see Her. Why can 't I?_" He would  
often proclaim piteously: " _Mother, You showed yourself to Ramprasad. Why don  
't you show yourself to me? I don't want wealth, friends and family, or  
objects of enjoyment. Please reveal yourself to me._"   
\- As the days went by, the Master's love and longing continued to increase.  
Because of his uninterrupted current of thought towards the Divine Mother,  
some external signs manifested in his body. His appetite and need for sleep  
diminished. As blood flowed continually to his chest and head, his chest  
turned crimson and his eyes were often drenched with tears. He constantly and  
intensely desired to see the Divine Mother, and repeatedly asked himself, "  
_What shall I do? How can I see Her?_ ".   
\- We heard from the Master that one day at that time he was singing to the  
Divine Mother and praying and crying bitterly. He implored piteously, "  
_Mother, I have been praying to You so long! Why don 't you listen to me? You  
showed yourself to Ramprasad. Why don't you show yourself to me?_"   
The Master described what happened then" "There was an unbearable pain in my  
heart because I could not have a vision of Mother. Just as a man wrings out a  
towel with all his strength to get the water out of it, so I felt my heart was  
being wrung out. I began to think I shall never see Mother. I was dying of  
despair. In my agony I asked myself" " _What 's the use of living this  
life?_"...   
\- Although his longing did not always manifest itself externally through  
signs such as weeping, it remained in his heart all the time. Sometimes it  
would increase to such a point that he would not contain it anymore.  
Restlessly rolling on the ground with agony, he would pray: " _Mother, be  
gracious unto me. Reveal yourself to me._ " He would cry so bitterly that  
people would gather around him to watch. He was completely unconcerned about  
what people might say when they saw him in that condition. He later said: "I  
scarcely realized the presence of people around me. They looked more like  
shadows or painted pictures than real objects, and so I did not feel any shame  
or embarrasment at all. Sometimes I would lose outer consciousness from that  
unbearable agony.   
\   
Reading these passages again and again heartfully (substituting the Divine  
Mother for one's Guru, chosen Deity or formless Self if one likes) awakens the  
deeper self within us. We also become aware of the blocks which prevents our  
entry into the deeper core of our being. It is these blocks which prevent  
Self-enquiry also. If the blocks get cleared, Self-enquiry also improves.  
There can be many paths, but the blocks are the same, within us.

Questioner: I long for bhakti. I want more of this longing. Even realization  
does not matter for me. Let me be strong in my longing.   
Sri Ramana Maharshi: If the longing is there, realization will be forced on  
you even if you do not want it. Long for it intensely so that the mind melts  
in devotion. After camphor burns away no residue is left. The mind is the  
camphor. When it has resolved itself into the Self without leaving even the  
slightest trace behind, it is realization of the Self.

Swami Vivekananda gives almost a similar description: Man is an infinite circle whose circumference is nowhere, but the centre is  
located in one spot; and God is an infinite circle whose circumference is  
nowhere, but whose centre is everywhere. He works through all hands, sees  
through all eyes, walks on all feet, breathes through all bodies, lives in all  
life, speaks through every mouth, and thinks through every brain.

Yearning is essential to attain Godhead. Yearning is effort.   
Efforts will confer you the Awareness, after which there will   
be no yearning for anything. I think, Sri Ramakrishna has said   
one or two similes: 1. Like a man who is very very thirsty, longing for water.   
2. Like a man in utter poverty, longing to get a job.   
Arunachala Siva.

you know what fascinated me the most about the O as symbol for the enlightened  
mind in buddhism?   
that the circle is also the symbol of samsara, or the "wheel of life"?   
something to think about deeply

Dear matthias,   
Yes. I agree. The Upanishads call the Brahman or the Self as   
Poornam, or zero. The fullness. You may observe that the number   
0 has not angularities, though mathematicians can say that at   
every point in the circumference, there is a very very small angle,   
(silentgreen, your comments please). All numbers from 1 to 9 have   
some angularities when written on hand. Any angularity denotes   
the ego-self. The number 8 is again a mystery. It is a strangulated   
0. This Maya, Prakriti, Nature, Mother. If she ( withdraws her   
strangulation of you, you become 0 or Poornam or Sivam.   
The wheel of samsara, is again a 0 but there are arcs, eight or   
four arcs. This is Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha.   
Arunachala Siva.

Quote  
i tell a man to become strong like an elephant   
he kicks the elephant and wonders why its about to crush him  
Sri Ramakrishna tells the story about pride of money:  _A frog had a rupee which he had kept in a pit. An elephant on its way walked  
over the pit. Rushing out angrily the frog raised its foot at the elephant and  
said, How dare you walk over me? Such is the pride money breeds!_   
Though this story is related to pride of money, it is applicable for pride in  
general.   
We have dug so many pits of pride within us. Many we have forgotten, where  
exactly the pit is, but each is binding us. The elephant of God's love needs  
to find the holes, fill them up and carry away the frog on its back.
