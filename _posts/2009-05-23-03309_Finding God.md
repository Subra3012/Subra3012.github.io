**Finding God**   
Pointing to the heart, the Master (Sri Ramakrishna) used to say: "He who has God here, also has him there (pointing to the external world).   
He who does not find God within himself,   
will never find Him outside of himself.   
But he who sees Him in the temple of his own soul,   
sees Him also in the temple of the universe.   
Om Shanti...

Dear Silentgreen, I found an extract with a similar theme in : The Path of Sri Ramana (Part Two) by Sri Sadhu Om.   
The extract is from Chapter 1. The World and God. Pages 14 and 15.   
It is only after the first person feeling I am a man has risen from sleep,  
that the world which is seen in front of us appears. The mind or man who sees  
this world then feels impelled to infer and accept the existence of an  
almighty God who is able to create this world, which is seen so vast and  
multivarious. That is, in the waking state, after the rising of the first  
person feeling I am so and so, which did not exist in sleep, everyone has to  
accept the existence of the other two entities, the world and God, which are  
second and third persons. The world and God are non-existent only when the  
first person feeling I am a man is non  existent, that is, in sleep and in  
the truly awakened state of Self knowledge. At such times no necessity arises  
to accept the world and God. This is a fact we can clearly understand from the  
following teachings of Sri Bhagavan: ...After an I rises, everything rises   
Ulladu Narpadu verse 23   
If the ego comes into existence, everything will come into existence. If the  
ego does not exist, everything will not exist. The ego itself is everything.   
Ulladu Narpadu verse 26   
If the thought I does not exist, no other things will exist.   
Sri Arunachala Ashtakam verse 7.   
Paul.

Dear silentgreen and Paul,   
Bhagavan Ramana said about the pure advaita when He   
said: "What is Real is the Self within, Atma Swarupa only.   
The world, the jiva, the god are all imaginations." Who am I?   
This is the quinteseence of Ajata Vada, Advaita. In sleep,   
when the world is absent, the Self alone is there within.   
When one wakes up from sleep, the world appears and so   
the gods. Even personal god has an end. The Atma Swarupa,   
Brahman or the Self is alone eternal.   
But for the majority of people, for whom this high level is   
unreachable, to start with, then bhakti is advised. Bhakti   
or devotion becomes dual. It needs a devotee and a devoted   
object. Hereis where the god comes. We have Narayana,   
Siva, Christ, Allah and others. But Brahman alone is eternal   
and everpresent, without beginning and end.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear paul, matthias and others,   
When I quoted Who am I?, I have left an important covenant   
given by Bhagavan Ramana. "The Atmaswarupa or the Self   
alone is Real and eternal, the world, the jiva, and the god   
are all imaginations....." Here, one should add the important   
covenant, "like silver in the oyster shell". Silver is   
imagination only for a while, that is, till one sees the oyster   
shell. Hence even the "silver" is not a pure imagination,   
but that one which stems from the oyster shell, which alone,   
is Real, through false understanding. Silver is also seen, but when oyster  
shell is seen, the silver disappears. The same is   
the case with snake and the rope. The rope alone is real, the snake appears  
for a while, because of false understanding.   
The silver and the snake have got a cause which is non-form, non-name god or  
Brahman.   
The snake example is more useful to understand the 'fear'   
or the samsara or the travails of worldly life. The snake   
which is itself false, gives a fear of samsara. The rope,   
when seen, the fear goes away once for all.   
Arunachala Siva.

There is a proverb in tamil. It goes like that. if you see the dog made out of  
stone (sculpture) you would not see the stone but the dog.   
But if you think this is stone then you do not see the dog. can this example  
also be the same with the rope and the snake.

Dear All,   
From the deeper implied meaning from which I often find Sri Ramakishna speak,  
I would correlate this with: (with devotional underpinnings to it)   
(a) Jesus Christ's saying:  _Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God_   
extending this a bit: Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God everywhere.   
(b) Bhagavan's self-enquiry: merging of the "I" in the Heart   
expressing it as: When the I merges in the Heart, one sees God everywhere.   
As one proceeds in understanding from dvaita to advaita. ..   
the nature of "seeing" in "seeing God" also changes...   
Sri Ramakrisha was commanded by Mother Kali to remain in Bhavamukha.   
He effortlessly moved from Dvaita to Advaita, as one moves from door to door  
within a house...   
so many of his sayings are such that they can be interpreted either from  
dvaitic or advaitic viewpoints.   
Om Shanti. ..

Dear silentgreen,   
Yes you are correct. SRK shifted from vikalpa to nirvikalpa   
samadhi states, and back to vikalpa, as he wished. He   
was in dvaitam, as he was praying to Mother Kali, and in   
advitam when he was contemplating/meditating. SRK   
drank milk from both the cups with ease. Bhagavan   
Ramana was always in Sahaja Samadhi, where the pure mind   
did all the worldly work that was needed to be done by Him.   
Dear ramanaduli,   
That is Tirumoolar's wonderful piece from Tirumandiram.   
The doll elephant looks both like a wood as well as elephant.   
This is same as the classical advaita examples of silver   
and conchshell, snake and rope, water and mirage.   
Arunachala Siva.
