Forum rules -   
Any guru mentioned on this forum MUST have been dead for at least 50 years.   
Please abide by the rules of the forum or you will be excluded from using it.   
Nisargadatta (April 17, 1897  September 8, 1981)   
He has not been dead for fifty years, if I am not wrong.   
I think this forum rule is to avoid futile arguments on guru.   
I wonder why some of forum members keep breaking this rule.   
Recently on this forum, some of members keep replying to me with mention of  
Nisargadatt.   
I am fed up.   
I do not mind that some members have faith in Nisargadatta.   
I hope they do not mind that I think Nisargadatta is a fake.   
Orginally I did not want to say this, as I do not want to hurt other members'  
feeling.   
I say this because they seem to be persistent.   
What we have in common here is faith in Bhagavan Ramana.   
Please do not push other members to believe in other gurus.

is not forbiddden.
