The Brahmo devotee: "If everything is really being done by Him, youre not  
responsible for your sins."   
Sri Ramakrishna (smiling): "Duryodhana said: 'O Hrishikesh, I act as You,  
seated within my heart, make me act.'   
"If you have the right kind of faith  that God alone is the Doer and you do  
nothing, you cant commit a sin. The person who knows how to dance well never  
takes a wrong step.   
"But unless youre pure in heart, you dont even have the faith that God  
exists."

Dear grhluna,   
Nice to hear about your words and your success in spiritual quest.   
This is what a spiritual person does.   
It is as if a diver had entered deep inside the sea, came out and tells what  
is inside the sea.   
There is no discontinuity in the cosmic poem.

Dear grhluna,   
Very Nice. The poetry is the Sruti (the continuous monotone), of our all our  
activities, in life.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear grhluna,   
Yes, the life of Anandamayi Ma is very interesting and moving. Teachings wise,  
Krishnamurti comes closest to Bhagawan though he spoke mainly at the absolute  
level.   
Anandamayi Ma visited the ashram in Tiruvannamalai and also met Krishnamurti.  
She had simply looked at a photograph of Krishnamurti and realized he was  
"very great". Krishnamurti was always embarassed at being called a guru, but  
Anandamayi Ma called him the guru of gurus.   
For ajnanis, it is hard to make logical sense of the behaviour of jnanis. Best  
not to compare jnanis but simply read their accounts and let it be.

Dear grhluna,   
You are just a kid. I can barely remember my late twenties.   
A mind with a multitude of thoughts often in conflict cannot be a jnani and I  
am not one by any means.   
Quote  
sometimes i feel why be bother to people why not throw my body over a cliff  
What makes you feel you are a bother to people? The body is the creation of  
accumulated karma that must be worked out in life. Throwing it over a cliff  
may only result in another body that has to work out the same karma.   
Quote  
But i know my life is nothing but a dream the body included  
Then you are not a bother and there is nobody else to bother. And no real body  
to throw over a cliff.   
Quote  
Who can understand such being? Can you? I can't  
Ramana and Krishnamurti can be understood only by realizing the Self. Any  
other claim of understanding them is only delusion.

Dear grhluna,   
About that Bhagavan Ramana's photograph of 1900, when He was just 21   
years old, this was taken by one Pillai of Kumbakonam. I think Bhagavan   
was at the entrance of Virupaksha Cave, for the sake of proper lighting!   
One photographer in later years wonders: Why that camera and the stand   
(old type tripod stand cameras with frames), and the photographer did not   
explode into pieces, when he looked into the lens to see the figure of  
Bhagavan? It is like seeing the Sun through a telescope, without filters!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear amiatall,   
Quote  
To my mind, many can intellectually grasp what they are talking about, but to  
really start listening and go together with them, is quite a task to a human  
being.  
Even intellectual understanding at some depth is not as easy as we think,  
which is why most people who claim it end up arguing and disagreeing most of  
the time. That is because they can only understand certain words as spoken by  
their guru, his explanations, his examples. When another jnani speaks, they  
are unable to comprehend even intellectually since the words, descriptions and  
examples appear different on the surface. Which leads to the 'my jnani is  
better than your jnani' syndrome.   
There is an incident in one of the books where Bhagawan mentions why he simply  
told people to follow whatever method they like and in due course they could  
realize the Self. Otherwise, he said, people will get depressed at the  
enormity of the job! In another instance he says that people did not  
understand how difficult Self realization is.
