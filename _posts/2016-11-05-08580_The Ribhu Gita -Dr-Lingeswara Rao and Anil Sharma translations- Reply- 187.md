8. There is no past, no future. Brahman stays constant. I am consciousness.   
The insentient is insignificant. The destruction of the body is only  
consciousness.   
9. Wherever there be the mind even in the least, I, of the Self, annihilate the mind.   
That which is truth, knowledge and infinity is not falsehood, insentience or  
painful.   
10. The Self is truth and infinite. The Self is body only -- of this there is no doubt.   
Whatever news is heard that is all unreal. I alone am the light of the  
lights.   
11. Even the numeration one is unreal. Brahman alone is real, ever I am. Indeed   
everything is unreal, being an emanation from the Supreme always.   
12\. Though devoid of all limbs, being eternal, I am the Supreme alone. All  
that is   
seen is naught for me in the least. I say this because I am consciousness.   
13. I have no anger whatsoever. I say this because I am consciousness. There is   
nothing whatsoever to be denoted as 'this' \-- nothing at all.   
14. I am the attribute-less Brahman, being taught by the wise Guru. Relative   
knowledge is Brahman with attributes. I am knowledge personified.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
