## What prevents & What to do - Nisargadatta Maharaj  
Author: silentgreen         Date: November 11, 2009, 12:37:41 PM

\- What prevents the insight into one's true nature is the weakness and  
obtuseness of the mind and its tendency to skip the subtle and focus the gross  
only. When you follow my advice and try to keep your mind on the notion of "I  
am" only, you become fully aware of your mind and its vagaries. Awareness,  
being lucid harmony (satva) in action, dissolves dullness and quietens the  
restlessness of the mind, and gently but steadily changes its very substance.  
This change need not be spectacular; it may be hardly noticeable; yet it is a  
deep and fundamental shift from darkness into light, from inadvertence to  
awarenesss. For this, keep steadily in the focus of consciousness the only  
clue you have: your certainty of being. Be with it, play with it, ponder over  
it, delve deeply into it, till the shell of ignorance breaks open and you  
emerge into the realm of reality.   
\- All I can say truly is: "I am", all else is inference. But the inference  
has become a habit. Destroy all habits of thinking and seeing. The sense "I  
am" is the manifestation of a deeper cause, which you may call self, God,  
Reality or by any other name. The "I am" is in the world, but it is the key  
which can open the door out of the world.   
\- Look at yourself steadily - it is enough. The door that locks you in is  
also the door that lets you out. The "I am" is the door. Stay at it until it  
opens. As a matter of fact, it is open, only you are not at it. You are  
waiting at the non-existing painted doors, which will never open.

## Cautionary Advice

This board has been created at the request of a member.   
It is probably a good idea, but caution should be exercised when contacting  
strangers.   
Not everyone who visits forums, or attaches themselves to any faith structure  
is genuine or well-balanced.   
Please be careful.
