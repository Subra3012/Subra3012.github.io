## Visiting Tiruvannamalai  
Author: abhilash.ayyagari   Date: September 01, 2013, 11:05:07 AM

Hello all,   
I am planning to make a trip to Tiruvannavamalai after Dussera and before  
Diwali. Since Karthika Maasam starts after Diwali, i understand it will be a  
busy period for a month from then, i wanted to know how busy the period  
between Dussera and Diwali (14th October to 1st November) will be. Ideally i  
would like to visit when the crowd is less both in Ramana Asramam and the Big  
temple.   
Please advice.

Dear abhilash,   
Between Dasara and Deepavali, if you choose week days and also non-full moon  
days, it will be less crowded.   
Arunachala Siva.

I am in Mumbai and you are in Pune, you called me, but still I am not in  
right mindset to call you bad, time and again I think of you Ji, sorry,  
before you make a trip I will meet you to give you few orders from Ramasramam.

Dear friends,   
After a lot of delays, i have finally managed to make reservations to travel  
to Tiruvannamalai on the 28th Feb. I wrote to the ashram to request for  
accommodation but they are unable to provide any on account of Mahasivaratri  
on the 27th. They have recommended Andhra Siva Sannidhi. I wanted to know if  
any of you have stayed at this place and how the accommodation was.   
Also, i was under the impression that the days after Mahasivaratri may not be  
very crowded, would you know how easy/difficult the darshan would be during  
this period. Reason i want to know is, i am taking my parents along and this  
is their first visit to Tiruvannamalai and they would find it difficult to  
stand in long queues for darshan due to old age.   
Any other options available for accommodation would be greatly helpful.   
Regards,   
Abhilash Ayyagari

Dear abhilash.ayyagiri,   
On Mahasivaratri days only the Big Temple will be crowded and there will not  
be that much crowd in the Asramam.   
About Andhra Siva Sannidhi, I have no idea.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thank you Vinod and Subramanian Sir.   
Vinod - Is there any mail id that i could write to, to confirm the booking? i  
spoke to someone on the phone who took down the details but i am skeptical as  
he mentioned i should call back before we arrive to confirm again. I tried one  
id mentioned on their website but mail has bounced back. There was another  
blog i found called Arunachala grace who had pictures of Siva Sannidhi and the  
rooms and said they do bookings on their behalf so i have written to them too  
but no response yet. please advice the best way to secure an accommodation in  
advance with them.   
And i will be visiting the day after Mahasivaratri, i.e on the 28th Feb. I  
hope the crowds won't be too much on the day after the festival.   
Thank you once again.

Thanks Vinod. I trust Bhagavan and Arunachala to take care of us if he has  
called us at that time I am sure we can manage.   
Many thanks for your inputs.
