Dear DRPVSSN Raju, All duality is based on the mind. If   
there is no mind, the Maya will be able to do nothing!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear grhluna,   
Excellent. We mock at a person who says "You are a man". But we ourselves   
do not believe we are men, at the first instance. Bhagavan Ramana has said   
that everyone is "I" \- the Self. But we do not believe it. We think, we are   
Subramanian, Nagaraj, Udai Shankar, Prasanth etc., etc., No one believes   
we are men. We believe in shirts, the sheaths but not in our Heart.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear grhluna,   
Nicw. Once some devotee wanted to take Bhagavan Ramana in a special   
train throughout India, so that He could see places! Bhagavan Ramana   
said: You are taking me, alright, but what can I see? (He is seeing nothing  
but the Self.).   
Sri Abhirami Bhattar who was a devi (goddess)-upasaka says in his poem: The the Redness of the Sun, and the Redness of the Heart, she stays in   
both the Red, the Lady with red-lotus like breasts! I see the red-lotus in   
her eyes, with nothing but compassion for me. Her face itself is a Red   
Lotus, and I see nothing but motherliness in her face. She is full of mercy  
and she gives me with her red-lotus like hands, and her two feet are like   
two lotuses.   
Sri Bhattar, sees in the sun and in the eyes, limbs and face of Mother   
only the Red Sun, which is metaphysical symbolism for Heart-Centre.   
Arunachala Siva.
