Sharing this article from merinews: When you save your environment, you save the future of mankind.   
Gone are the days of clear blue sky, chirping birds, pure water streams,  
limpid sunshine, today, these are all just locked in our fantasy books.  
Courtesy- Mankind, for the continued active efforts to have made earth the  
place it is today!   
Do you care when you see the no-more-blue-sky, are you scared to drink the no-  
more-pure water, annoyed of the honking of vehicles, has depletion of ozone  
layer bothered you any day, are u anxious to embrace the bright sunshine  
again? Many luxuries have overridden the importance of our natural habitat -  
The environment. Before we take the final step on the ladder of causing the  
repeated damage, let us hold on for sometime and think, take your steps back  
people, save the environment and save the future of mankind. Because the  
breaking news is : There's just one planet we can live on.   
When our planet 'Earth' is facing huge environment challenges, it is our duty  
to undo the damage, we have inflicted on our home 'the earth'. We, each one of  
us, needs to take on the baton and save our planet. It is a call for sincere  
accountability and responsibility on every one's part, let's save our home,  
together.   
June 5, calls for World Environment day every year to stimulate awareness  
across the world on environment issues, this year, United Nations urged the  
world to take corrective measures to fight for change in the climate and put a  
check on improved management of forests and green land. The theme for year  
2009 is 'Your planet needs you - Fight to combat climate change'.   
One might debate over the environment issues and measures to preserve it but  
maybe it deserves a bit more respect than mankind has bestowed upon it so far.   
Question yourself-   
What can we do to preserve environment?   
Do we keep a check on every action that might hamper our natural habitat?   
Do we ever to restore what we have destroyed?   
Can we raise awareness around?   
Its not a favour, its our responsibility towards our own planet.   
Om Shanti. ..

Dear Mohan,   
The Self alone is the Holiest place, space, what ever we may like to call it  
than any other holy places. There is one stoy. A Guru with all his students  
went to the Ganges to have a holy bath. The Guru and all his students went  
into the water and were having their bath, suddenly the Guru was being swept  
away from the current of the river, he shouted for Help and also told that  
only the one who is absolutely sinless to the core can and has to save him,  
otherwise others will also drown! Hearing and seeing the Guru, all were  
shocked and scared and were totally not at all confident about themselves of  
being absolutely Sinless.   
But, among them, one of the students without any second thoughts swam forward  
and saved the Guru. Later, all the other students were so surprised about the  
confidence of the boy. Then this boy told them, What about Sins? as soon as I  
stepped into the Ganges all my sins vanished immediately the moment I kept my  
foot inside the water.   
Like this, its only the matter of ones faith alone, If the Self wills, even a  
battlefield becomes Holy. Abiding as Self alone is the Holiest of all. In  
Mahabharata, the soldiers used to do Arghya Pradhana using mud due to non  
availability of water.   
Yes travelling to Holy places help due to the Vibrations of the Eternal  
Brahman in such places.

Dear soham3,   
Yes. Bhagavan Ramana and several other yogis and jnanis   
who had lived in Arunachala had such vision. Ordinary   
mortals cannot have such experiences. But people have   
strange experiences in Arunachala. Once a Keralite, Sukumaran,   
told me, that while in a room, he had a sudden call from Ramana   
in the early morning around 2 am., [not in dreams] to go round the Hill  
immediately to have his problems solved. He took his bath and went around the  
Hill immediately.   
Arunachala Siva.

But if everything is inside us and we have to solve all our problems on an  
individual basis through self analysis, how can going around the hill solve  
any problem? Would not that be against Ramana's teaching itself? How can  
anything done in this physical world solve our problems?

Dear mmohan,   
Do you earnestly believe that all problems can be solved   
by you by meditating within? No. One needs outside help,   
till we understand and arrive at that state of nondualism.   
It starts from the womb. Suppose mother denies that the   
food she eats should not go to the child in the womb and   
the child should take care of its problem, can the child survive?   
Can you cure your stomach pain or cataract in the eye by   
meditating within? Don't you need a doctor outside? This   
outside help from God or Guru is called Grace. With people   
in the world it is called love or compassion.   
There is a story about Ribhu Gita, Tamil translation, by   
Ulaganatha Swamigal, [Bhikshu Sastrigal]. He completed   
Ribhu Gita, with no invocation song on God, no mention about   
God throughout the book! Nataraja wanted to teach him a   
lesson. As soon as he completed the book, he became blind.   
He suffered for a while. Then slowly he started praying to   
Nataraja of Chidambaram. Nataraja appeared in his dream,   
and told him: Have you become that great to write a book   
without seeking Vinayaka's help and my grace? Include   
an invocation song and also as a punishment, you add a   
song on me, at the end of each chapter of Ribhu Gita. Ulaganatha Swamigal  
dictated these songs and asked his   
disciple to write them out at the end of each chapter and   
then submitted the entire work to Siva Nataraja of Chidambaram and prayed. He  
got back his eye sight! This is mentioned   
graphically in Sri Ramansramam's book and also in the   
wonderful English verse translation by Dr. H. Ramamoorthy   
and Nome by Society for Abidance in Truth, SAT, California.   
Arunachala Siva.

I guess not Dear Soham, it will interest only those who are on their path to  
become Jnani's alone.. Archaelogists will only find rocks, stones and sand and  
mud. They will only find inert things, but only aspirants will see the  
glorious Sun in it.

Dear soham3,   
Yes. During Bhagavan Ramana's time, when they renovating   
Arunachaleswara Temple, they found a stone slab near the   
Siva Linga, and on removing it, they found a dark tunnel. They   
immediately rushed to Bhagavan and asked Him what to do.   
Bhagavan Ramana said: "Do not try to investigate the tunnel.   
Please close the stone slab, as it was before." Arunachala   
Puranam says that yogis, siddhas and jnanis who are living   
in the Hill as forms of bright lights, come through the tunnel,   
in their subtle bodies and pray to Arunachaleswara at night.   
I do not know whether you believe this since you are not   
believing many things. Arachelogists have in fact found that   
the Hill is as old as the earth itself, geologically, say about   
3 billion years old and is older than Himalayas. But if they   
try to dig it and find something, they would find nothing, since   
the treasures may not be visible to their biological eyes. Recently, some  
company took lease of the far-western portion   
of the Hill, and wanted to dig and take ferro-aluminum alloy   
ore. People in the villages nearby protested and the project   
was abandoned under a High Court Order. It is like Mackenna's   
Gold. Gold is there in the Appachian Mountains, but if any one   
tries to take it, they will not return alive.   
Arunachala Siva.

Still I don't get it. If this whole physical world is either maya or divine,  
how can there be anything special or holy about one place in the universe as  
compared to another place? Is not every bit of nature impregnated with the  
divine?   
Many advaintins say that pilgrimages to holy places etc are only for beginers  
to inspire them mentally and not required once you are a fulltime seeker and  
have the knowledge that the divine is within and everywhere in equal measure.

Dear mmohan,   
Yes. The whole world is either Maya or Divine. It is Maya   
till you arrive and it is all Divine, once you have arrived.   
Each place is holy but some are holier than the rest. Take   
for example, God appears before you and say that you have   
to sacrifice one component of the body. Now I shall take   
both your eyes? Would you agree? You will say instead,   
"You told me to sacrifice only one component. I shall   
sacrifice my whole hair or whole of my teeth." At best,   
you will agree to sacrifice your two legs but definitely   
not the eyes. The whole body is important, but the eyes   
are the more important of them.   
There is a story in the Bible, which is told in a different   
context. A shepherd was herding 100 sheep, one was   
lost in the jungle. He was more worried about the lost   
sheep [Bible says it is lost lamb, any way], than the   
remaining 99 sheep. Now tell me, is the lost sheep more   
important than the remaining 99 or not?   
For me Tiruvannamalai is the holiest. I do not in fact,   
like to visit any other place. For some other it could   
be Sri Rangam. For some more, it could be Velankanni,   
or Tirupati. For my son, he says he would like visit only   
Angkor Vat, in Cambodia again and again. Why one is   
holier or more important for some one and not for some   
one else?   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear mmohan,   
Again, please do not think only the so called 'holy places'   
are holy. It could be even non spiritual place. For Mother   
Teresa,and later to Sister Nirmala, their foundation Nirmal   
Hridaya in Kolkata is the holiest place in the world. When   
Mother Teresa came back from Vatican after getting the   
acclaim of Sainthood, she said that Nirmal Hridaya is the   
holiest place for her and not Vatican. For Sikhs their   
book Granth Sahib is the greatest and not the Gurdwara   
per se. The place could be anything. Kanchi Chandrasekara   
Saraswati, whose birthday falls today, slept almost all nights   
in the cowshed in Kanchi Math. He did not sleep in the Math   
premises or before the deity of Kamakshi-Chandramouliswara   
inside the Math. He slept there whenever he used to stay inside   
the Math without tour. You and I cannot sleep even one night   
in such a place. An army of mosquitoes due to cowdung and cow-urine, mud  
floor, smell of hay and cowdung. For him, that place was holier than anything  
else.   
Place need not be a Siva or Vishnu temple. It need not be   
even Arunachala Hill. It need not be Gangetic bank in Kasi.   
It can be as you consider it holy. You make the place holy   
and not the place as such. Since I have experienced that   
sublime holiness in Arunachala, I consider that Hill and town   
as the holiest, holier than Kasi and Kailas.   
There is a Tamil poem: Neerellam Ganga   
Nilamella Kasi   
Oorellam Thillai   
Malaiyellam Annamalai.   
All waters are Ganga   
All earth is Kasi   
All places are Thillai, Chidambaram   
All hills are Arunachala.   
You only make it holy.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear mmohan,   
The Hill within me is not leaving me today without writing   
to you further. Now take holy names. There are innumerable   
names for Siva and Vishnu and Devi in Hindu pantheon. Each   
god has got 1008 great names for him or her. What is the   
holiest? It depends on your faith. For Saivites and Advaitis   
they prefer Om Nama Sivaya, which is Sthula Panchakshara,   
which has to be told to you by a guru. Vaishnavites have   
got Om Namo Narayanaya. You can choose anything that   
appeals to you. A simple name does not need any inititation.   
Bhagavan Ramana has said: Even if you say your own name or   
I,I, I, it will take you to quelling of the mind. He said Siva Siva   
to Annamalai Swami and Muruganar and to a Harijan who came   
to Him and asked Him to say something to do! He told His   
devotees not to change to any other name from what is already appealing to one  
or initiated by a guru. When someone said   
Can I shift from Rama, Rama to Ramana Ramana, He asked: "Why? Are Rama and Ramana different?   
Arunachala Siva.

Thanks a lot Subramanian for your kind explanations. That surely helps. But  
still one doubt persist in my mind. Is it NECESSARY to have a particular holy  
place or a holy name for oneself to transcend and reach salvation? Is it not  
possible otherwise? Would not there be an attachment towards this place and  
name and the mind gets disturbed whenever we are not able to go to this place  
or not able to chant this name as much as we want? The buddhist have this  
method of not concentrating on anything in particular so as to stop all  
attractions and aversions of the mind and calm it down.

Dear mmohan,   
There is nothing wrong in meditating on the Spece, the Akasa,   
which is also of the 5 elements. But meditating on the Space   
is difficult. When a child sees a large empty hall, to which   
his father has shifted, he will immediately look for certain   
of his dolls to be placed in such and such a place etc., If   
you see an empty sky on a new moon day, you will try to   
track stars if any. Meditating on empty Space, Sunya, as   
Buddhists call, might be difficult. But if one could could   
do that it is okay.   
Fixing a holy place or a holy name for your meditation is not   
an attachment. Perhaps this is One attachment, which will also go off in due  
course. Bhagavan Ramana says it is like a mud   
on your feet. When the mud dries up, it falls away on its own!   
But seekers definitely need an one point attention to begin with.   
One reason why Teravadis in Buddhism went for praying to the   
idle of Buddha, is the same case.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Soham, Mohan   
What I understand from Sri Ramana's statement is that Arunachala is the Centre  
of the Universe, it is the heart of the Universe. In it abides everything. By  
this What Ramana Maharshi meant is that Arunachala is none but you alone, the  
real eternal 'I' and when the Ego is about to merge with this eternal Brahman,  
i.e. Arunachala, the Ego I is welcomed by the Brahman, and this is what is  
meant when Ramana said sages and all the other wonderful things seen inside  
Arunachala.   
Sri Ramana has always said that only the I exists and everything else is only  
a shadow or Maya.   
That Heart or Arunachala is within you, all the sages, etc.. is within the I  
itself.   
Sri Ramana, told the whole Vedantha Saaram in two simple lines: Hridhaya Kuhara Madhye Kevalam Bhramha Mathram   
Aham Aham Ithi Sakshath Athma Roopo Bhavantham   
Deep inside the cave (hollow) of heart Heart, there resides only Brahmam,  
Atman. And in this Atman - Brahman is the Entire Universe.   
What Ramana Meant by going inside through the Tunnel is the Self Enquiry,  
through the Tunnel of Self Enquiry, We are waiting to be received by the All  
Glorious Brahman in which contains all the Universe.   
Sri Ramana, explained the nature of Bhramham. He says that in the cage of the  
heart, Inside Arunachala, The Hill (Rocks, Mud Sand, etc) is our Body an what  
is to be found inside is the Heart - Brahmam resides, which is always  
exhibiting itself as "Self" or "Aham" \- (All Sages, Cities, etc...), which is  
nothing but the Athman.
