Uddava Gita is the parting instructions of Sri Krishna, to Uddava,   
before he left the earth. It appears as Chapters 6 to 29 of XI   
Skanda of Srimad Bhagavatam. It is here the famous Avadhuta's   
story comes. The twenty four chapters sums up the essence of   
various paths like Karma, Bhakti, Yoga and Jnana. A sample,   
" He the Supreme Lord of the high and low, remains as a mass   
of transcendent Knowledge and Bliss, known as the Absolute,   
and without attributes." (Sloka 18 of Chapter IV)   
" There, O Uddava! dwelling on your own Self, till the attainment   
of realization, be endowed with knowledge and bliss and worship   
Me with devotion." (Sloka 17 of Chapter IX)   
" That which, when one object is transformed into another, abides   
at its beginning, middle and end, and remains when those objects   
return to their cause, is verily the Real." (Sloka 17 of Chapter XIX)   
" It is the body which, directed by something, works and is   
modified till death, but the man of realization, with his desire   
quenched by experiencing the bliss of the Atman, even though   
he is in the body, is not affected by work." (Sloka 30 of Chapter XXIII)   
" Ideas of rivalry, jealousy, pity and egoism quickly depart from a   
man who thinks of Me abiding in all men." (Sloka 15 of Chapter XXIV)   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai, there is a beautiful translation in English,   
published by Sri Ramakrishna Math. There is also   
a Tamil translation by Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai.   
Arunachala Siva.
