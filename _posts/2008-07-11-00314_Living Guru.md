Dear aio, the details regarding Sri Ramanasramam, Tiruvannamalai,   
have been extensively posted by me and others in response to   
similar questions by others. Please see the points given by   
various Forum members under 'Arunachala Ramana - Ashram'.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear non duel, at the outset, my comp did not work for 15 days   
due to some unknown problem, hence there is some break in my   
prattiling! For most of us, the idea of a living guru appeals more,   
because we are so much used to names and forms. Again not one   
living guru, one seeks several living gurus! Bhagavan has said on   
many occasions that the devotees need not worry about being in   
a body permanently. Bhagavan lived 70 years in His body as an   
'avatara' to drive home the Truth but it is too much to expect Him   
to live always in body. The Guru need not be a living Guru. His   
Presence is always felt by genuine seekers even today. For people   
who seek miracles, He is causing miracles even today. For example,   
after 15 days, He has set right my comp on a fee of $ 6.00. No parts   
changed, no parts added, only a simple correction by a young engineer!   
I was only praying to Him: "You have made me go without even doing   
something in your glory? Why?" Then I chanted the famous Tiruvachakam verse,  
" You know what I want. You will give me all that   
you want. You are unreachable even to Bramha and Vishnu, who always   
wanted something or other from you. You have always given me what   
I had wanted. Even you know what I have to want from you, and that is what  
you want!" Arunachala Siva.
