## some questions -  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: March 28, 2009, 08:33:16 PM

I have some questions... I am aware its born out of despair... maybe some sort  
of urgency...   
1. Bhagawan realised in spite of any desire to realisation. He did not even have and idea about realisation but still whatever happened to him is absolutely involuntary. Why did it happen to him?   
2. Bhagawan had death experience when he realised Brahman. Does everyone undergo some kind of death experience to realise? it need not be the case I feel.   
What is true? Dvaita or Advaita or Visishtadvaita?   
1 Is there anything apart from me? is there a GOD apart from me? - Dvaita  
for I should pray to him and win his grace to realise myself?   
2 Is there the Higher Authority? and am I small part of him? -  
Visishtadvaita for I should pray for that Higher authority so that he graces  
small part of himself?   
3 Am I myself the only resort? No one there at all? Am I to search the SELF  
all by myself?   
What am I to do?   
When Bhagawan realised, he never bothered about Dvaita, Visishtadvaita or  
Advaita. It just happened to him even without his wanting it.   
Is realisation granted only to the unwanting souls?   
Many say Bhagawan had already worked out all his Karmas in his past birth, is  
there rebirth in reality in conventional terms? or it just happened to  
Bhagawan just like that?   
What do we believe and what do I not believe? What do I do?   
My enquiry does not seem to work for me... (Its more out of despair, I know I  
need to work more, but....)   
what to do? what to not do? how to just be? Who am I... I know the immediate  
answer from myself... find out this 'I' and and it will get merged into the  
eternal 'I' but.... its not happening... (maybe I have not enquired enough  
but)   
Why has this sprung... why has there a need to realise been created... if we  
are already that SELF always... I dont understand anything...   
I just hope and pray dvaitically advaitically visidhtadvaitically.....

Sometimes I also feel, I should stop my quest and keep all my books and  
spirituality in some box and just be... just doing my daily routine and  
chores... conventionally get entangled in worldly life and just wait for it to  
happen to me.... Bhagawan was completely engrossed in worldly life before he  
realised.... he used to play to his hearts content... etc...   
but again another thought runs... if I get entangled in worldly life... I am  
getting father away from spirituality....

I always simply ask myself to listen tot he silence of bhagawan....this helps  
me alot   
it is like "please may I speak to the "Iam"   
and hten I simply rest in this..it helps me make the shift from believing Iam  
not this...into "Iam" this   
I just can say that in order to be it you have to be it....and no desire is an  
aid not even the pure desire of self realisaiton..   
and I thought about nirvikalpa samadhi yesterday....will it come? or will it  
not come and if it is neccessary...you know if you go deep into meditaiotn  
there arecertain points were it gets heavy...and fear comes up because the  
unknown is knocking on the door...   
I think due to personal growth and faith this hardships will end...   
but I do not know if nirvikalpha samadhi is a must or not...in case of the  
great spiritual giants it was always part of their awakening but in zen  
tradition lot of the masters never expereinced this...so I do not know

In Bhagavan Ramana's case, it was just one dive and He never returned. And  
that is why we call Him as an avatara of Skanda   
and Jnana Sambandha. But in most of our cases, the dive has to be   
done several times. Sometimes a pearl and some other times, a heap of mud and  
stone. Pereseverence and continued patience is the only way. You cannot  
throw away books or pictures or stop Arunachala visits just as you like.  
Perhaps after one year, you will take this back and re-start. Everything  
happens as per destiny. Desiring the Self is the only desire that we can  
have. The rest of them should be left to destiny or Guru.   
Bhagavan Ramana's philosphy is Advaita. He did not say it. Only after  
reading Sankara in Tiruvannamalai, He felt that his experience and Sankara's  
descriptions tallied. In fact, Bhagavan Ramana said   
about Ajata Vada of Gaudapada, Sankara's Guru's Guru. And that is more  
correct. But He never dis-approved dvaita or visishtadvaita. He said all  
paths lead to the royal road of Self enquiry. And that is why He never  
approved change of religion even to Westerners and Muslims and Sindhis. He  
said: "All you fellows, you will one day come to the royal road of self enquiry  
through various sub roads."   
Arunachala Siva.

dear nagaraj,   
doubt is very much a part of the search. the journey we have undertaken may  
appear to be difficult at times. the churning is so important so that  
something can emerge out of it. i think we should give value to our doubts  
too.   
the "Tat" of the "tat twam asi" is "tat" so far as we are not realised. There  
may not be any this or that or i or u once we become realised.   
so even when things appear to be confusing/not clear because in our experience  
we dont know what self is apart from what we read here or there or are told  
here and there....the search should continue, isn't it?   
Because THAT / TAT alone matters.......!   
love,   
vinita

I read some lines of augustinus the father of the church..just some moments  
before I read the post of vinita...   
he wrote we should start to doubt everything, step by step, then we will se  
that we can doubt our intellect...that we can even doubt the senses..because  
what we see,hear,taste etc. may ba a hallucination.....but then we will see  
that there must be something that doubts....something that can doubt but  
cannot be the object of out doubts...   
this we cannot doubt is this moment, the arising of what is...and augustinus  
concludes that god lives in this presence.....that this presence that is here  
right now is the way to god...   
what we read up there.... is advaita isnt it?   
neti neti and vichara...the way was always the same...ramana restored it so  
beautifull, so easy, so direct, like no one before him....   
we should thank him for this with all we can give int he present moment

In Sri Ramana Ashottaram, there is one Name: Prostrations to the One who swallowed all the doubts!   
This has become possible for Bhagavan Ramana as soon as He became   
self realized. Whereas, we are all haunted by torturing doubts, because we  
are not yet with the Goal. Sankara uses a word Vipareeta   
Sandheha in Vivekachoodamani. That is, even after the way has been   
taught, the disciple finds Sunya, emptiness, and started doubting the way  
itself! Then the Guru says, "Stay in that Sunya, without any doubts, the  
Effulgence would soon dawn!" I think, this sums up   
the whole matter.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear all,   
Thanks to one and all for all your wise words. I found each post soothing and  
calming like a balm. I am in midst of crisis from all angles of life, I was  
more venting it out!   
Sometimes in crises one does not even know how to surrender to Sri Ramana. Its  
an abyss! Absolute darkness!   
Thanks once again to one and all

What is called Samsara... is like the vast Himalayas. I feel being crushed  
under it. I am unable to bear the burden of Samsara.

Nagarjuna come to my mind: In order to help prevent people from getting attached to the idea of nirvana,  
the Bodhisattva Nagarjuna stated: Samsara [i.e., the stream of conditioned existence] has nothing that  
distinguishes it from nirvana; nirvana has nothing that distinguishes it from  
samsara. The limit of nirvana is the limit of samsara; there is not even the  
subtlest something separating the two.   
\   
Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is found;   
The deeds are, but no doer of the deeds is there;   
Nirvana is, but not the man that enters it;   
The path is, but no traveller on it is seen

Once Viswanatha Swami's brother came to the Asramam for darshan   
of Bhagavan. He was a freedom fighter and he had just then been in   
prison. Obviously he was against casteism. At lunch, he wanted to   
sit with nonbrahmins! Bhagavan Ramana used to sit in between the brahmin and  
non brahmin rows, at right angles. Even today, there is   
a photograph, where He is sitting before plate leaf. Bhagavan Ramana told  
Viswanatha Swami: "Look! Desiring to sit with non brahmins to show that you  
are against castes, is itself a desire.   
Do not do that. Sit with me if you want!" Viswanatha Swami's brother  
sliently went to sit at brahmin's row. Bhagavan Ramana   
always showed that one should not deliberately desire any opposite   
views, just to prove one's point. Aspring Sannyasa, because Grahastha-ship is  
unmanageable is equally bad as desiring the opposite.   
Arunachala Siva.

dear subramanyaji,   
without trying to prove a point, desiring freedom thru self enquiry is the  
opposite of living in a state on "ignorance"/non-enquiry.   
to my limited understanding desire is essential to my progress just as it is a  
barrier to my progress.   
desiring to reach a state where i unite with self - self which is always there  
- may seem to be a contradiction.   
the fact is that desire is a motivating force for the unrealised.   
For the realised, of course, there may be no desire / no motivation.   
regards,   
vinita

before I read the post of vinita...   
he wrote we should start to doubt everything, step by step, then we will se  
that we can doubt our intellect...that we can even doubt the senses..because  
what we see,hear,taste etc. may ba a hallucination.....but then we will see  
that there must be something that doubts....something that can doubt but  
cannot be the object of out doubts...   
this we cannot doubt is this moment, the arising of what is...and augustinus  
concludes that god lives in this presence.....that this presence that is here  
right now is the way to god...   
what we read up there.... is advaita isnt it?   
neti neti and vichara...the way was always the same...ramana restored it so  
beautifull, so easy, so direct, like no one before him....   
we should thank him for this with all we can give int he present moment

In Sri Ramana Ashottaram, there is one Name: Prostrations to the One who swallowed all the doubts!   
This has become possible for Bhagavan Ramana as soon as He became   
self realized. Whereas, we are all haunted by torturing doubts, because we  
are not yet with the Goal. Sankara uses a word Vipareeta   
Sandheha in Vivekachoodamani. That is, even after the way has been   
taught, the disciple finds Sunya, emptiness, and started doubting the way  
itself! Then the Guru says, "Stay in that Sunya, without any doubts, the  
Effulgence would soon dawn!" I think, this sums up   
the whole matter.

Dear all,   
Thanks to one and all for all your wise words. I found each post soothing and  
calming like a balm. I am in midst of crisis from all angles of life, I was  
more venting it out!   
Sometimes in crises one does not even know how to surrender to Sri Ramana. Its  
an abyss! Absolute darkness!   
Thanks once again to one and all

Nagarjuna come to my mind: In order to help prevent people from getting attached to the idea of nirvana,  
the Bodhisattva Nagarjuna stated: Samsara [i.e., the stream of conditioned existence] has nothing that  
distinguishes it from nirvana; nirvana has nothing that distinguishes it from  
samsara. The limit of nirvana is the limit of samsara; there is not even the  
subtlest something separating the two.   
\   
Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is found;   
The deeds are, but no doer of the deeds is there;   
Nirvana is, but not the man that enters it;   
The path is, but no traveller on it is seen

Once Viswanatha Swami's brother came to the Asramam for darshan   
of Bhagavan. He was a freedom fighter and he had just then been in   
prison. Obviously he was against casteism. At lunch, he wanted to   
sit with nonbrahmins! Bhagavan Ramana used to sit in between the brahmin and  
non brahmin rows, at right angles. Even today, there is   
a photograph, where He is sitting before plate leaf. Bhagavan Ramana told  
Viswanatha Swami: "Look! Desiring to sit with non brahmins to show that you  
are against castes, is itself a desire.   
Do not do that. Sit with me if you want!" Viswanatha Swami's brother  
sliently went to sit at brahmin's row. Bhagavan Ramana   
always showed that one should not deliberately desire any opposite   
views, just to prove one's point. Aspring Sannyasa, because Grahastha-ship is  
unmanageable is equally bad as desiring the opposite.

dear subramanyaji,   
without trying to prove a point, desiring freedom thru self enquiry is the  
opposite of living in a state on "ignorance"/non-enquiry.   
to my limited understanding desire is essential to my progress just as it is a  
barrier to my progress.   
desiring to reach a state where i unite with self - self which is always there  
- may seem to be a contradiction.   
the fact is that desire is a motivating force for the unrealised.   
For the realised, of course, there may be no desire / no motivation.   
regards,   
vinita

## some questions -  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: March 28, 2009, 08:33:16 PM

I have some questions... I am aware its born out of despair... maybe some sort  
of urgency...   
1. Bhagawan realised in spite of any desire to realisation. He did not even have and idea about realisation but still whatever happened to him is absolutely involuntary. Why did it happen to him?   
2. Bhagawan had death experience when he realised Brahman. Does everyone undergo some kind of death experience to realise? it need not be the case I feel.   
What is true? Dvaita or Advaita or Visishtadvaita?   
1 Is there anything apart from me? is there a GOD apart from me? - Dvaita  
for I should pray to him and win his grace to realise myself?   
2 Is there the Higher Authority? and am I small part of him? -  
Visishtadvaita for I should pray for that Higher authority so that he graces  
small part of himself?   
3 Am I myself the only resort? No one there at all? Am I to search the SELF  
all by myself?   
What am I to do?   
When Bhagawan realised, he never bothered about Dvaita, Visishtadvaita or  
Advaita. It just happened to him even without his wanting it.   
Is realisation granted only to the unwanting souls?   
Many say Bhagawan had already worked out all his Karmas in his past birth, is  
there rebirth in reality in conventional terms? or it just happened to  
Bhagawan just like that?   
What do we believe and what do I not believe? What do I do?   
My enquiry does not seem to work for me... (Its more out of despair, I know I  
need to work more, but....)   
what to do? what to not do? how to just be? Who am I... I know the immediate  
answer from myself... find out this 'I' and and it will get merged into the  
eternal 'I' but.... its not happening... (maybe I have not enquired enough  
but)   
Why has this sprung... why has there a need to realise been created... if we  
are already that SELF always... I dont understand anything...   
I just hope and pray dvaitically advaitically visidhtadvaitically.....   
Nagaraj

Sometimes I also feel, I should stop my quest and keep all my books and  
spirituality in some box and just be... just doing my daily routine and  
chores... conventionally get entangled in worldly life and just wait for it to  
happen to me.... Bhagawan was completely engrossed in worldly life before he  
realised.... he used to play to his hearts content... etc...   
but again another thought runs... if I get entangled in worldly life... I am  
getting father away from spirituality....   
??

I always simply ask myself to listen tot he silence of bhagawan....this helps  
me alot   
it is like "please may I speak to the "Iam"   
and hten I simply rest in this..it helps me make the shift from believing Iam  
not this...into "Iam" this   
I just can say that in order to be it you have to be it....and no desire is an  
aid not even the pure desire of self realisaiton..   
and I thought about nirvikalpa samadhi yesterday....will it come? or will it  
not come and if it is neccessary...you know if you go deep into meditaiotn  
there arecertain points were it gets heavy...and fear comes up because the  
unknown is knocking on the door...   
I think due to personal growth and faith this hardships will end...   
but I do not know if nirvikalpha samadhi is a must or not...in case of the  
great spiritual giants it was always part of their awakening but in zen  
tradition lot of the masters never expereinced this...so I do not know

In Bhagavan Ramana's case, it was just one dive and He never returned. And  
that is why we call Him as an avatara of Skanda   
and Jnana Sambandha. But in most of our cases, the dive has to be   
done several times. Sometimes a pearl and some other times, a heap of mud and  
stone. Pereseverence and continued patience is the only way. You cannot  
throw away books or pictures or stop Arunachala visits just as you like.  
Perhaps after one year, you will take this back and re-start. Everything  
happens as per destiny. Desiring the Self is the only desire that we can  
have. The rest of them should be left to destiny or Guru.   
Bhagavan Ramana's philosphy is Advaita. He did not say it. Only after  
reading Sankara in Tiruvannamalai, He felt that his experience and Sankara's  
descriptions tallied. In fact, Bhagavan Ramana said   
about Ajata Vada of Gaudapada, Sankara's Guru's Guru. And that is more  
correct. But He never dis-approved dvaita or visishtadvaita. He said all  
paths lead to the royal road of Self enquiry. And that is why He never  
approved change of religion even to Westerners and Muslims and Sindhis. He  
said: "All you fellows, you will one day come to the royal road of self enquiry  
through various sub roads."   
Arunachala Siva.

dear nagaraj,   
doubt is very much a part of the search. the journey we have undertaken may  
appear to be difficult at times. the churning is so important so that  
something can emerge out of it. i think we should give value to our doubts  
too.   
the "Tat" of the "tat twam asi" is "tat" so far as we are not realised. There  
may not be any this or that or i or u once we become realised.   
so even when things appear to be confusing/not clear because in our experience  
we dont know what self is apart from what we read here or there or are told  
here and there....the search should continue, isn't it?   
Because THAT / TAT alone matters.......!   
love,   
vinita

all by myself?   
What am I to do?   
When Bhagawan realised, he never bothered about Dvaita, Visishtadvaita or  
Advaita. It just happened to him even without his wanting it.   
Is realisation granted only to the unwanting souls?   
Many say Bhagawan had already worked out all his Karmas in his past birth, is  
there rebirth in reality in conventional terms? or it just happened to  
Bhagawan just like that?   
What do we believe and what do I not believe? What do I do?   
My enquiry does not seem to work for me... (Its more out of despair, I know I  
need to work more, but....)   
what to do? what to not do? how to just be? Who am I... I know the immediate  
answer from myself... find out this 'I' and and it will get merged into the  
eternal 'I' but.... its not happening... (maybe I have not enquired enough  
but)   
Why has this sprung... why has there a need to realise been created... if we  
are already that SELF always... I dont understand anything...   
I just hope and pray dvaitically advaitically visidhtadvaitically.....

Sometimes I also feel, I should stop my quest and keep all my books and  
spirituality in some box and just be... just doing my daily routine and  
chores... conventionally get entangled in worldly life and just wait for it to  
happen to me.... Bhagawan was completely engrossed in worldly life before he  
realised.... he used to play to his hearts content... etc...   
but again another thought runs... if I get entangled in worldly life... I am  
getting father away from spirituality....

I always simply ask myself to listen tot he silence of bhagawan....this helps  
me alot   
it is like "please may I speak to the "Iam"   
and hten I simply rest in this..it helps me make the shift from believing Iam  
not this...into "Iam" this   
I just can say that in order to be it you have to be it....and no desire is an  
aid not even the pure desire of self realisaiton..   
and I thought about nirvikalpa samadhi yesterday....will it come? or will it  
not come and if it is neccessary...you know if you go deep into meditaiotn  
there arecertain points were it gets heavy...and fear comes up because the  
unknown is knocking on the door...   
I think due to personal growth and faith this hardships will end...   
but I do not know if nirvikalpha samadhi is a must or not...in case of the  
great spiritual giants it was always part of their awakening but in zen  
tradition lot of the masters never expereinced this...so I do not know

In Bhagavan Ramana's case, it was just one dive and He never returned. And  
that is why we call Him as an avatara of Skanda   
and Jnana Sambandha. But in most of our cases, the dive has to be   
done several times. Sometimes a pearl and some other times, a heap of mud and  
stone. Pereseverence and continued patience is the only way. You cannot  
throw away books or pictures or stop Arunachala visits just as you like.  
Perhaps after one year, you will take this back and re-start. Everything  
happens as per destiny. Desiring the Self is the only desire that we can  
have. The rest of them should be left to destiny or Guru.   
Bhagavan Ramana's philosphy is Advaita. He did not say it. Only after  
reading Sankara in Tiruvannamalai, He felt that his experience and Sankara's  
descriptions tallied. In fact, Bhagavan Ramana said   
about Ajata Vada of Gaudapada, Sankara's Guru's Guru. And that is more  
correct. But He never dis-approved dvaita or visishtadvaita. He said all  
paths lead to the royal road of Self enquiry. And that is why He never  
approved change of religion even to Westerners and Muslims and Sindhis. He  
said: "All you fellows, you will one day come to the royal road of self enquiry  
through various sub roads."   
Arunachala Siva.

dear nagaraj,   
doubt is very much a part of the search. the journey we have undertaken may  
appear to be difficult at times. the churning is so important so that  
something can emerge out of it. i think we should give value to our doubts  
too.   
the "Tat" of the "tat twam asi" is "tat" so far as we are not realised. There  
may not be any this or that or i or u once we become realised.   
so even when things appear to be confusing/not clear because in our experience  
we dont know what self is apart from what we read here or there or are told  
here and there....the search should continue, isn't it?   
Because THAT / TAT alone matters.......!   
love,   
vinita

I read some lines of augustinus the father of the church..just some moments  
before I read the post of vinita...   
he wrote we should start to doubt everything, step by step, then we will se  
that we can doubt our intellect...that we can even doubt the senses..because  
what we see,hear,taste etc. may ba a hallucination.....but then we will see  
that there must be something that doubts....something that can doubt but  
cannot be the object of out doubts...   
this we cannot doubt is this moment, the arising of what is...and augustinus  
concludes that god lives in this presence.....that this presence that is here  
right now is the way to god...   
what we read up there.... is advaita isnt it?   
neti neti and vichara...the way was always the same...ramana restored it so  
beautifull, so easy, so direct, like no one before him....   
we should thank him for this with all we can give int he present moment

In Sri Ramana Ashottaram, there is one Name: Prostrations to the One who swallowed all the doubts!   
This has become possible for Bhagavan Ramana as soon as He became   
self realized. Whereas, we are all haunted by torturing doubts, because we  
are not yet with the Goal. Sankara uses a word Vipareeta   
Sandheha in Vivekachoodamani. That is, even after the way has been   
taught, the disciple finds Sunya, emptiness, and started doubting the way  
itself! Then the Guru says, "Stay in that Sunya, without any doubts, the  
Effulgence would soon dawn!" I think, this sums up   
the whole matter.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear all,   
Thanks to one and all for all your wise words. I found each post soothing and  
calming like a balm. I am in midst of crisis from all angles of life, I was  
more venting it out!   
Sometimes in crises one does not even know how to surrender to Sri Ramana. Its  
an abyss! Absolute darkness!   
Thanks once again to one and all

Nagarjuna come to my mind: In order to help prevent people from getting attached to the idea of nirvana,  
the Bodhisattva Nagarjuna stated: Samsara [i.e., the stream of conditioned existence] has nothing that  
distinguishes it from nirvana; nirvana has nothing that distinguishes it from  
samsara. The limit of nirvana is the limit of samsara; there is not even the  
subtlest something separating the two.   
\   
Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is found;   
The deeds are, but no doer of the deeds is there;   
Nirvana is, but not the man that enters it;   
The path is, but no traveller on it is seen

Once Viswanatha Swami's brother came to the Asramam for darshan   
of Bhagavan. He was a freedom fighter and he had just then been in   
prison. Obviously he was against casteism. At lunch, he wanted to   
sit with nonbrahmins! Bhagavan Ramana used to sit in between the brahmin and  
non brahmin rows, at right angles. Even today, there is   
a photograph, where He is sitting before plate leaf. Bhagavan Ramana told  
Viswanatha Swami: "Look! Desiring to sit with non brahmins to show that you  
are against castes, is itself a desire.   
Do not do that. Sit with me if you want!" Viswanatha Swami's brother  
sliently went to sit at brahmin's row. Bhagavan Ramana   
always showed that one should not deliberately desire any opposite   
views, just to prove one's point. Aspring Sannyasa, because Grahastha-ship is  
unmanageable is equally bad as desiring the opposite.   
Arunachala Siva.

dear subramanyaji,   
without trying to prove a point, desiring freedom thru self enquiry is the  
opposite of living in a state on "ignorance"/non-enquiry.   
to my limited understanding desire is essential to my progress just as it is a  
barrier to my progress.   
desiring to reach a state where i unite with self - self which is always there  
- may seem to be a contradiction.   
the fact is that desire is a motivating force for the unrealised.   
For the realised, of course, there may be no desire / no motivation.   
regards,   
vinita

I have some questions... I am aware its born out of despair... maybe some sort  
of urgency...   
1. Bhagawan realised in spite of any desire to realisation. He did not even have and idea about realisation but still whatever happened to him is absolutely involuntary. Why did it happen to him?   
2. Bhagawan had death experience when he realised Brahman. Does everyone undergo some kind of death experience to realise? it need not be the case I feel.   
What is true? Dvaita or Advaita or Visishtadvaita?   
1 Is there anything apart from me? is there a GOD apart from me? - Dvaita  
for I should pray to him and win his grace to realise myself?   
2 Is there the Higher Authority? and am I small part of him? -  
Visishtadvaita for I should pray for that Higher authority so that he graces  
small part of himself?   
3 Am I myself the only resort? No one there at all? Am I to search the SELF  
all by myself?   
What am I to do?   
When Bhagawan realised, he never bothered about Dvaita, Visishtadvaita or  
Advaita. It just happened to him even without his wanting it.   
Is realisation granted only to the unwanting souls?   
Many say Bhagawan had already worked out all his Karmas in his past birth, is  
there rebirth in reality in conventional terms? or it just happened to  
Bhagawan just like that?   
What do we believe and what do I not believe? What do I do?   
My enquiry does not seem to work for me... (Its more out of despair, I know I  
need to work more, but....)   
what to do? what to not do? how to just be? Who am I... I know the immediate  
answer from myself... find out this 'I' and and it will get merged into the  
eternal 'I' but.... its not happening... (maybe I have not enquired enough  
but)   
Why has this sprung... why has there a need to realise been created... if we  
are already that SELF always... I dont understand anything...   
I just hope and pray dvaitically advaitically visidhtadvaitically.....

In Sri Ramana Ashottaram, there is one Name: Prostrations to the One who swallowed all the doubts!   
This has become possible for Bhagavan Ramana as soon as He became   
self realized. Whereas, we are all haunted by torturing doubts, because we  
are not yet with the Goal. Sankara uses a word Vipareeta   
Sandheha in Vivekachoodamani. That is, even after the way has been   
taught, the disciple finds Sunya, emptiness, and started doubting the way  
itself! Then the Guru says, "Stay in that Sunya, without any doubts, the  
Effulgence would soon dawn!" I think, this sums up   
the whole matter.

Dear all,   
Thanks to one and all for all your wise words. I found each post soothing and  
calming like a balm. I am in midst of crisis from all angles of life, I was  
more venting it out!   
Sometimes in crises one does not even know how to surrender to Sri Ramana. Its  
an abyss! Absolute darkness!   
Thanks once again to one and all

Nagarjuna come to my mind: In order to help prevent people from getting attached to the idea of nirvana,  
the Bodhisattva Nagarjuna stated: Samsara [i.e., the stream of conditioned existence] has nothing that  
distinguishes it from nirvana; nirvana has nothing that distinguishes it from  
samsara. The limit of nirvana is the limit of samsara; there is not even the  
subtlest something separating the two.   
\   
Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is found;   
The deeds are, but no doer of the deeds is there;   
Nirvana is, but not the man that enters it;   
The path is, but no traveller on it is seen

Once Viswanatha Swami's brother came to the Asramam for darshan   
of Bhagavan. He was a freedom fighter and he had just then been in   
prison. Obviously he was against casteism. At lunch, he wanted to   
sit with nonbrahmins! Bhagavan Ramana used to sit in between the brahmin and  
non brahmin rows, at right angles. Even today, there is   
a photograph, where He is sitting before plate leaf. Bhagavan Ramana told  
Viswanatha Swami: "Look! Desiring to sit with non brahmins to show that you  
are against castes, is itself a desire.   
Do not do that. Sit with me if you want!" Viswanatha Swami's brother  
sliently went to sit at brahmin's row. Bhagavan Ramana   
always showed that one should not deliberately desire any opposite   
views, just to prove one's point. Aspring Sannyasa, because Grahastha-ship is  
unmanageable is equally bad as desiring the opposite.

dear subramanyaji,   
without trying to prove a point, desiring freedom thru self enquiry is the  
opposite of living in a state on "ignorance"/non-enquiry.   
to my limited understanding desire is essential to my progress just as it is a  
barrier to my progress.   
desiring to reach a state where i unite with self - self which is always there  
- may seem to be a contradiction.   
the fact is that desire is a motivating force for the unrealised.   
For the realised, of course, there may be no desire / no motivation.   
regards,   
vinita

I have some questions... I am aware its born out of despair... maybe some sort  
of urgency...   
1. Bhagawan realised in spite of any desire to realisation. He did not even have and idea about realisation but still whatever happened to him is absolutely involuntary. Why did it happen to him?   
2. Bhagawan had death experience when he realised Brahman. Does everyone undergo some kind of death experience to realise? it need not be the case I feel.   
What is true? Dvaita or Advaita or Visishtadvaita?   
1 Is there anything apart from me? is there a GOD apart from me? - Dvaita  
for I should pray to him and win his grace to realise myself?   
2 Is there the Higher Authority? and am I small part of him? -  
Visishtadvaita for I should pray for that Higher authority so that he graces  
small part of himself?   
3 Am I myself the only resort? No one there at all? Am I to search the SELF  
all by myself?   
What am I to do?   
When Bhagawan realised, he never bothered about Dvaita, Visishtadvaita or  
Advaita. It just happened to him even without his wanting it.   
Is realisation granted only to the unwanting souls?   
Many say Bhagawan had already worked out all his Karmas in his past birth, is  
there rebirth in reality in conventional terms? or it just happened to  
Bhagawan just like that?   
What do we believe and what do I not believe? What do I do?   
My enquiry does not seem to work for me... (Its more out of despair, I know I  
need to work more, but....)   
what to do? what to not do? how to just be? Who am I... I know the immediate  
answer from myself... find out this 'I' and and it will get merged into the  
eternal 'I' but.... its not happening... (maybe I have not enquired enough  
but)   
Why has this sprung... why has there a need to realise been created... if we  
are already that SELF always... I dont understand anything...   
I just hope and pray dvaitically advaitically visidhtadvaitically.....   
Nagaraj

Sometimes I also feel, I should stop my quest and keep all my books and  
spirituality in some box and just be... just doing my daily routine and  
chores... conventionally get entangled in worldly life and just wait for it to  
happen to me.... Bhagawan was completely engrossed in worldly life before he  
realised.... he used to play to his hearts content... etc...   
but again another thought runs... if I get entangled in worldly life... I am  
getting father away from spirituality....   
??

I always simply ask myself to listen tot he silence of bhagawan....this helps  
me alot   
it is like "please may I speak to the "Iam"   
and hten I simply rest in this..it helps me make the shift from believing Iam  
not this...into "Iam" this   
I just can say that in order to be it you have to be it....and no desire is an  
aid not even the pure desire of self realisaiton..   
and I thought about nirvikalpa samadhi yesterday....will it come? or will it  
not come and if it is neccessary...you know if you go deep into meditaiotn  
there arecertain points were it gets heavy...and fear comes up because the  
unknown is knocking on the door...   
I think due to personal growth and faith this hardships will end...   
but I do not know if nirvikalpha samadhi is a must or not...in case of the  
great spiritual giants it was always part of their awakening but in zen  
tradition lot of the masters never expereinced this...so I do not know

In Bhagavan Ramana's case, it was just one dive and He never returned. And  
that is why we call Him as an avatara of Skanda   
and Jnana Sambandha. But in most of our cases, the dive has to be   
done several times. Sometimes a pearl and some other times, a heap of mud and  
stone. Pereseverence and continued patience is the only way. You cannot  
throw away books or pictures or stop Arunachala visits just as you like.  
Perhaps after one year, you will take this back and re-start. Everything  
happens as per destiny. Desiring the Self is the only desire that we can  
have. The rest of them should be left to destiny or Guru.   
Bhagavan Ramana's philosphy is Advaita. He did not say it. Only after  
reading Sankara in Tiruvannamalai, He felt that his experience and Sankara's  
descriptions tallied. In fact, Bhagavan Ramana said   
about Ajata Vada of Gaudapada, Sankara's Guru's Guru. And that is more  
correct. But He never dis-approved dvaita or visishtadvaita. He said all  
paths lead to the royal road of Self enquiry. And that is why He never  
approved change of religion even to Westerners and Muslims and Sindhis. He  
said: "All you fellows, you will one day come to the royal road of self enquiry  
through various sub roads."   
Arunachala Siva.

dear nagaraj,   
doubt is very much a part of the search. the journey we have undertaken may  
appear to be difficult at times. the churning is so important so that  
something can emerge out of it. i think we should give value to our doubts  
too.   
the "Tat" of the "tat twam asi" is "tat" so far as we are not realised. There  
may not be any this or that or i or u once we become realised.   
so even when things appear to be confusing/not clear because in our experience  
we dont know what self is apart from what we read here or there or are told  
here and there....the search should continue, isn't it?   
Because THAT / TAT alone matters.......!   
love,   
vinita

I read some lines of augustinus the father of the church..just some moments  
before I read the post of vinita...   
he wrote we should start to doubt everything, step by step, then we will se  
that we can doubt our intellect...that we can even doubt the senses..because  
what we see,hear,taste etc. may ba a hallucination.....but then we will see  
that there must be something that doubts....something that can doubt but  
cannot be the object of out doubts...   
this we cannot doubt is this moment, the arising of what is...and augustinus  
concludes that god lives in this presence.....that this presence that is here  
right now is the way to god...   
what we read up there.... is advaita isnt it?   
neti neti and vichara...the way was always the same...ramana restored it so  
beautifull, so easy, so direct, like no one before him....   
we should thank him for this with all we can give int he present moment

Sometimes I also feel, I should stop my quest and keep all my books and  
spirituality in some box and just be... just doing my daily routine and  
chores... conventionally get entangled in worldly life and just wait for it to  
happen to me.... Bhagawan was completely engrossed in worldly life before he  
realised.... he used to play to his hearts content... etc...   
but again another thought runs... if I get entangled in worldly life... I am  
getting father away from spirituality....

I always simply ask myself to listen tot he silence of bhagawan....this helps  
me alot   
it is like "please may I speak to the "Iam"   
and hten I simply rest in this..it helps me make the shift from believing Iam  
not this...into "Iam" this   
I just can say that in order to be it you have to be it....and no desire is an  
aid not even the pure desire of self realisaiton..   
and I thought about nirvikalpa samadhi yesterday....will it come? or will it  
not come and if it is neccessary...you know if you go deep into meditaiotn  
there arecertain points were it gets heavy...and fear comes up because the  
unknown is knocking on the door...   
I think due to personal growth and faith this hardships will end...   
but I do not know if nirvikalpha samadhi is a must or not...in case of the  
great spiritual giants it was always part of their awakening but in zen  
tradition lot of the masters never expereinced this...so I do not know

In Bhagavan Ramana's case, it was just one dive and He never returned. And  
that is why we call Him as an avatara of Skanda   
and Jnana Sambandha. But in most of our cases, the dive has to be   
done several times. Sometimes a pearl and some other times, a heap of mud and  
stone. Pereseverence and continued patience is the only way. You cannot  
throw away books or pictures or stop Arunachala visits just as you like.  
Perhaps after one year, you will take this back and re-start. Everything  
happens as per destiny. Desiring the Self is the only desire that we can  
have. The rest of them should be left to destiny or Guru.   
Bhagavan Ramana's philosphy is Advaita. He did not say it. Only after  
reading Sankara in Tiruvannamalai, He felt that his experience and Sankara's  
descriptions tallied. In fact, Bhagavan Ramana said   
about Ajata Vada of Gaudapada, Sankara's Guru's Guru. And that is more  
correct. But He never dis-approved dvaita or visishtadvaita. He said all  
paths lead to the royal road of Self enquiry. And that is why He never  
approved change of religion even to Westerners and Muslims and Sindhis. He  
said: "All you fellows, you will one day come to the royal road of self enquiry  
through various sub roads."   
Arunachala Siva.

My enquiry does not seem to work for me... (Its more out of despair, I know I

dear nagaraj,   
doubt is very much a part of the search. the journey we have undertaken may  
appear to be difficult at times. the churning is so important so that  
something can emerge out of it. i think we should give value to our doubts  
too.   
the "Tat" of the "tat twam asi" is "tat" so far as we are not realised. There  
may not be any this or that or i or u once we become realised.   
so even when things appear to be confusing/not clear because in our experience  
we dont know what self is apart from what we read here or there or are told  
here and there....the search should continue, isn't it?   
Because THAT / TAT alone matters.......!   
love,

I read some lines of augustinus the father of the church..just some moments  
before I read the post of vinita...   
he wrote we should start to doubt everything, step by step, then we will se  
that we can doubt our intellect...that we can even doubt the senses..because  
what we see,hear,taste etc. may ba a hallucination.....but then we will see  
that there must be something that doubts....something that can doubt but  
cannot be the object of out doubts...   
this we cannot doubt is this moment, the arising of what is...and augustinus  
concludes that god lives in this presence.....that this presence that is here  
right now is the way to god...   
what we read up there.... is advaita isnt it?   
neti neti and vichara...the way was always the same...ramana restored it so  
beautifull, so easy, so direct, like no one before him....   
we should thank him for this with all we can give int he present moment

In Sri Ramana Ashottaram, there is one Name: Prostrations to the One who swallowed all the doubts!   
This has become possible for Bhagavan Ramana as soon as He became   
self realized. Whereas, we are all haunted by torturing doubts, because we  
are not yet with the Goal. Sankara uses a word Vipareeta   
Sandheha in Vivekachoodamani. That is, even after the way has been   
taught, the disciple finds Sunya, emptiness, and started doubting the way  
itself! Then the Guru says, "Stay in that Sunya, without any doubts, the  
Effulgence would soon dawn!" I think, this sums up   
the whole matter.

Dear all,   
Thanks to one and all for all your wise words. I found each post soothing and  
calming like a balm. I am in midst of crisis from all angles of life, I was  
more venting it out!   
Sometimes in crises one does not even know how to surrender to Sri Ramana. Its  
an abyss! Absolute darkness!   
Thanks once again to one and all

Nagarjuna come to my mind: In order to help prevent people from getting attached to the idea of nirvana,  
the Bodhisattva Nagarjuna stated: Samsara [i.e., the stream of conditioned existence] has nothing that  
distinguishes it from nirvana; nirvana has nothing that distinguishes it from  
samsara. The limit of nirvana is the limit of samsara; there is not even the  
subtlest something separating the two.   
\   
Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is found;   
The deeds are, but no doer of the deeds is there;   
Nirvana is, but not the man that enters it;   
The path is, but no traveller on it is seen

Once Viswanatha Swami's brother came to the Asramam for darshan   
of Bhagavan. He was a freedom fighter and he had just then been in   
prison. Obviously he was against casteism. At lunch, he wanted to   
sit with nonbrahmins! Bhagavan Ramana used to sit in between the brahmin and  
non brahmin rows, at right angles. Even today, there is   
a photograph, where He is sitting before plate leaf. Bhagavan Ramana told  
Viswanatha Swami: "Look! Desiring to sit with non brahmins to show that you  
are against castes, is itself a desire.   
Do not do that. Sit with me if you want!" Viswanatha Swami's brother  
sliently went to sit at brahmin's row. Bhagavan Ramana   
always showed that one should not deliberately desire any opposite   
views, just to prove one's point. Aspring Sannyasa, because Grahastha-ship is  
unmanageable is equally bad as desiring the opposite.   
Arunachala Siva.

dear subramanyaji,   
without trying to prove a point, desiring freedom thru self enquiry is the  
opposite of living in a state on "ignorance"/non-enquiry.   
to my limited understanding desire is essential to my progress just as it is a  
barrier to my progress.   
desiring to reach a state where i unite with self - self which is always there  
- may seem to be a contradiction.   
the fact is that desire is a motivating force for the unrealised.   
For the realised, of course, there may be no desire / no motivation.   
regards,   
vinita

## some questions -  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: March 28, 2009, 08:33:16 PM

I have some questions... I am aware its born out of despair... maybe some sort  
of urgency...   
1. Bhagawan realised in spite of any desire to realisation. He did not even have and idea about realisation but still whatever happened to him is absolutely involuntary. Why did it happen to him?   
2. Bhagawan had death experience when he realised Brahman. Does everyone undergo some kind of death experience to realise? it need not be the case I feel.   
What is true? Dvaita or Advaita or Visishtadvaita?   
1 Is there anything apart from me? is there a GOD apart from me? - Dvaita  
for I should pray to him and win his grace to realise myself?   
2 Is there the Higher Authority? and am I small part of him? -  
Visishtadvaita for I should pray for that Higher authority so that he graces  
small part of himself?   
3 Am I myself the only resort? No one there at all? Am I to search the SELF  
all by myself?   
What am I to do?   
When Bhagawan realised, he never bothered about Dvaita, Visishtadvaita or  
Advaita. It just happened to him even without his wanting it.   
Is realisation granted only to the unwanting souls?   
Many say Bhagawan had already worked out all his Karmas in his past birth, is  
there rebirth in reality in conventional terms? or it just happened to  
Bhagawan just like that?   
What do we believe and what do I not believe? What do I do?   
My enquiry does not seem to work for me... (Its more out of despair, I know I  
need to work more, but....)   
what to do? what to not do? how to just be? Who am I... I know the immediate  
answer from myself... find out this 'I' and and it will get merged into the  
eternal 'I' but.... its not happening... (maybe I have not enquired enough  
but)   
Why has this sprung... why has there a need to realise been created... if we  
are already that SELF always... I dont understand anything...   
I just hope and pray dvaitically advaitically visidhtadvaitically.....   
Nagaraj

Sandheha in Vivekachoodamani. That is, even after the way has been   
taught, the disciple finds Sunya, emptiness, and started doubting the way  
itself! Then the Guru says, "Stay in that Sunya, without any doubts, the  
Effulgence would soon dawn!" I think, this sums up   
the whole matter.

Dear all,   
Thanks to one and all for all your wise words. I found each post soothing and  
calming like a balm. I am in midst of crisis from all angles of life, I was  
more venting it out!   
Sometimes in crises one does not even know how to surrender to Sri Ramana. Its  
an abyss! Absolute darkness!   
Thanks once again to one and all

What is called Samsara... is like the vast Himalayas. I feel being crushed

Nagarjuna come to my mind: In order to help prevent people from getting attached to the idea of nirvana,  
the Bodhisattva Nagarjuna stated: Samsara [i.e., the stream of conditioned existence] has nothing that  
distinguishes it from nirvana; nirvana has nothing that distinguishes it from  
samsara. The limit of nirvana is the limit of samsara; there is not even the  
subtlest something separating the two.   
\   
Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is found;   
The deeds are, but no doer of the deeds is there;   
Nirvana is, but not the man that enters it;   
The path is, but no traveller on it is seen

Once Viswanatha Swami's brother came to the Asramam for darshan   
of Bhagavan. He was a freedom fighter and he had just then been in   
prison. Obviously he was against casteism. At lunch, he wanted to   
sit with nonbrahmins! Bhagavan Ramana used to sit in between the brahmin and  
non brahmin rows, at right angles. Even today, there is   
a photograph, where He is sitting before plate leaf. Bhagavan Ramana told  
Viswanatha Swami: "Look! Desiring to sit with non brahmins to show that you  
are against castes, is itself a desire.   
Do not do that. Sit with me if you want!" Viswanatha Swami's brother  
sliently went to sit at brahmin's row. Bhagavan Ramana   
always showed that one should not deliberately desire any opposite   
views, just to prove one's point. Aspring Sannyasa, because Grahastha-ship is  
unmanageable is equally bad as desiring the opposite.

dear subramanyaji,   
without trying to prove a point, desiring freedom thru self enquiry is the  
opposite of living in a state on "ignorance"/non-enquiry.   
to my limited understanding desire is essential to my progress just as it is a  
barrier to my progress.   
desiring to reach a state where i unite with self - self which is always there  
- may seem to be a contradiction.   
the fact is that desire is a motivating force for the unrealised.   
For the realised, of course, there may be no desire / no motivation.   
regards,   
vinita

## some questions -  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: March 28, 2009, 08:33:16 PM

I have some questions... I am aware its born out of despair... maybe some sort  
of urgency...   
1. Bhagawan realised in spite of any desire to realisation. He did not even have and idea about realisation but still whatever happened to him is absolutely involuntary. Why did it happen to him?   
2. Bhagawan had death experience when he realised Brahman. Does everyone undergo some kind of death experience to realise? it need not be the case I feel.   
What is true? Dvaita or Advaita or Visishtadvaita?   
1 Is there anything apart from me? is there a GOD apart from me? - Dvaita  
for I should pray to him and win his grace to realise myself?   
2 Is there the Higher Authority? and am I small part of him? -  
Visishtadvaita for I should pray for that Higher authority so that he graces  
small part of himself?   
3 Am I myself the only resort? No one there at all? Am I to search the SELF  
all by myself?   
What am I to do?   
When Bhagawan realised, he never bothered about Dvaita, Visishtadvaita or  
Advaita. It just happened to him even without his wanting it.   
Is realisation granted only to the unwanting souls?   
Many say Bhagawan had already worked out all his Karmas in his past birth, is  
there rebirth in reality in conventional terms? or it just happened to  
Bhagawan just like that?   
What do we believe and what do I not believe? What do I do?   
My enquiry does not seem to work for me... (Its more out of despair, I know I  
need to work more, but....)   
what to do? what to not do? how to just be? Who am I... I know the immediate  
answer from myself... find out this 'I' and and it will get merged into the  
eternal 'I' but.... its not happening... (maybe I have not enquired enough  
but)   
Why has this sprung... why has there a need to realise been created... if we  
are already that SELF always... I dont understand anything...   
I just hope and pray dvaitically advaitically visidhtadvaitically.....

Sometimes I also feel, I should stop my quest and keep all my books and  
spirituality in some box and just be... just doing my daily routine and  
chores... conventionally get entangled in worldly life and just wait for it to  
happen to me.... Bhagawan was completely engrossed in worldly life before he  
realised.... he used to play to his hearts content... etc...   
but again another thought runs... if I get entangled in worldly life... I am  
getting father away from spirituality....   
??

I always simply ask myself to listen tot he silence of bhagawan....this helps  
me alot   
it is like "please may I speak to the "Iam"   
and hten I simply rest in this..it helps me make the shift from believing Iam  
not this...into "Iam" this   
I just can say that in order to be it you have to be it....and no desire is an  
aid not even the pure desire of self realisaiton..   
and I thought about nirvikalpa samadhi yesterday....will it come? or will it  
not come and if it is neccessary...you know if you go deep into meditaiotn  
there arecertain points were it gets heavy...and fear comes up because the  
unknown is knocking on the door...   
I think due to personal growth and faith this hardships will end...   
but I do not know if nirvikalpha samadhi is a must or not...in case of the  
great spiritual giants it was always part of their awakening but in zen  
tradition lot of the masters never expereinced this...so I do not know

In Bhagavan Ramana's case, it was just one dive and He never returned. And  
that is why we call Him as an avatara of Skanda   
and Jnana Sambandha. But in most of our cases, the dive has to be   
done several times. Sometimes a pearl and some other times, a heap of mud and  
stone. Pereseverence and continued patience is the only way. You cannot  
throw away books or pictures or stop Arunachala visits just as you like.  
Perhaps after one year, you will take this back and re-start. Everything  
happens as per destiny. Desiring the Self is the only desire that we can  
have. The rest of them should be left to destiny or Guru.   
Bhagavan Ramana's philosphy is Advaita. He did not say it. Only after  
reading Sankara in Tiruvannamalai, He felt that his experience and Sankara's  
descriptions tallied. In fact, Bhagavan Ramana said   
about Ajata Vada of Gaudapada, Sankara's Guru's Guru. And that is more  
correct. But He never dis-approved dvaita or visishtadvaita. He said all  
paths lead to the royal road of Self enquiry. And that is why He never  
approved change of religion even to Westerners and Muslims and Sindhis. He  
said: "All you fellows, you will one day come to the royal road of self enquiry  
through various sub roads."   
Arunachala Siva.

dear nagaraj,   
doubt is very much a part of the search. the journey we have undertaken may  
appear to be difficult at times. the churning is so important so that  
something can emerge out of it. i think we should give value to our doubts  
too.   
the "Tat" of the "tat twam asi" is "tat" so far as we are not realised. There  
may not be any this or that or i or u once we become realised.   
so even when things appear to be confusing/not clear because in our experience  
we dont know what self is apart from what we read here or there or are told  
here and there....the search should continue, isn't it?   
Because THAT / TAT alone matters.......!   
love,   
vinita

I read some lines of augustinus the father of the church..just some moments  
before I read the post of vinita...   
he wrote we should start to doubt everything, step by step, then we will se  
that we can doubt our intellect...that we can even doubt the senses..because  
what we see,hear,taste etc. may ba a hallucination.....but then we will see  
that there must be something that doubts....something that can doubt but  
cannot be the object of out doubts...   
this we cannot doubt is this moment, the arising of what is...and augustinus  
concludes that god lives in this presence.....that this presence that is here  
right now is the way to god...   
what we read up there.... is advaita isnt it?   
neti neti and vichara...the way was always the same...ramana restored it so  
beautifull, so easy, so direct, like no one before him....   
we should thank him for this with all we can give int he present moment

In Sri Ramana Ashottaram, there is one Name: Prostrations to the One who swallowed all the doubts!   
This has become possible for Bhagavan Ramana as soon as He became   
self realized. Whereas, we are all haunted by torturing doubts, because we  
are not yet with the Goal. Sankara uses a word Vipareeta   
Sandheha in Vivekachoodamani. That is, even after the way has been   
taught, the disciple finds Sunya, emptiness, and started doubting the way

Sometimes I also feel, I should stop my quest and keep all my books and  
spirituality in some box and just be... just doing my daily routine and  
chores... conventionally get entangled in worldly life and just wait for it to  
happen to me.... Bhagawan was completely engrossed in worldly life before he  
realised.... he used to play to his hearts content... etc...   
but again another thought runs... if I get entangled in worldly life... I am  
getting father away from spirituality....

I always simply ask myself to listen tot he silence of bhagawan....this helps  
me alot   
it is like "please may I speak to the "Iam"   
and hten I simply rest in this..it helps me make the shift from believing Iam  
not this...into "Iam" this   
I just can say that in order to be it you have to be it....and no desire is an  
aid not even the pure desire of self realisaiton..   
and I thought about nirvikalpa samadhi yesterday....will it come? or will it  
not come and if it is neccessary...you know if you go deep into meditaiotn  
there arecertain points were it gets heavy...and fear comes up because the  
unknown is knocking on the door...   
I think due to personal growth and faith this hardships will end...   
but I do not know if nirvikalpha samadhi is a must or not...in case of the  
great spiritual giants it was always part of their awakening but in zen  
tradition lot of the masters never expereinced this...so I do not know

In Bhagavan Ramana's case, it was just one dive and He never returned. And  
that is why we call Him as an avatara of Skanda   
and Jnana Sambandha. But in most of our cases, the dive has to be   
done several times. Sometimes a pearl and some other times, a heap of mud and  
stone. Pereseverence and continued patience is the only way. You cannot  
throw away books or pictures or stop Arunachala visits just as you like.  
Perhaps after one year, you will take this back and re-start. Everything  
happens as per destiny. Desiring the Self is the only desire that we can  
have. The rest of them should be left to destiny or Guru.   
Bhagavan Ramana's philosphy is Advaita. He did not say it. Only after  
reading Sankara in Tiruvannamalai, He felt that his experience and Sankara's  
descriptions tallied. In fact, Bhagavan Ramana said   
about Ajata Vada of Gaudapada, Sankara's Guru's Guru. And that is more  
correct. But He never dis-approved dvaita or visishtadvaita. He said all  
paths lead to the royal road of Self enquiry. And that is why He never  
approved change of religion even to Westerners and Muslims and Sindhis. He  
said: "All you fellows, you will one day come to the royal road of self enquiry  
through various sub roads."   
Arunachala Siva.

My enquiry does not seem to work for me... (Its more out of despair, I know I  
need to work more, but....)   
what to do? what to not do? how to just be? Who am I... I know the immediate  
answer from myself... find out this 'I' and and it will get merged into the  
eternal 'I' but.... its not happening... (maybe I have not enquired enough  
but)   
Why has this sprung... why has there a need to realise been created... if we  
are already that SELF always... I dont understand anything...   
dear nagaraj,   
doubt is very much a part of the search. the journey we have undertaken may  
appear to be difficult at times. the churning is so important so that  
something can emerge out of it. i think we should give value to our doubts  
too.   
the "Tat" of the "tat twam asi" is "tat" so far as we are not realised. There  
may not be any this or that or i or u once we become realised.   
so even when things appear to be confusing/not clear because in our experience  
we dont know what self is apart from what we read here or there or are told  
here and there....the search should continue, isn't it?   
Because THAT / TAT alone matters.......!   
love,

I read some lines of augustinus the father of the church..just some moments  
before I read the post of vinita...   
he wrote we should start to doubt everything, step by step, then we will se  
that we can doubt our intellect...that we can even doubt the senses..because  
what we see,hear,taste etc. may ba a hallucination.....but then we will see  
that there must be something that doubts....something that can doubt but  
cannot be the object of out doubts...   
this we cannot doubt is this moment, the arising of what is...and augustinus  
concludes that god lives in this presence.....that this presence that is here  
right now is the way to god...   
what we read up there.... is advaita isnt it?   
neti neti and vichara...the way was always the same...ramana restored it so  
beautifull, so easy, so direct, like no one before him....   
we should thank him for this with all we can give int he present moment

In Sri Ramana Ashottaram, there is one Name: Prostrations to the One who swallowed all the doubts!   
This has become possible for Bhagavan Ramana as soon as He became   
self realized. Whereas, we are all haunted by torturing doubts, because we  
are not yet with the Goal. Sankara uses a word Vipareeta   
Sandheha in Vivekachoodamani. That is, even after the way has been   
taught, the disciple finds Sunya, emptiness, and started doubting the way  
itself! Then the Guru says, "Stay in that Sunya, without any doubts, the  
Effulgence would soon dawn!" I think, this sums up   
the whole matter.

Dear all,   
Thanks to one and all for all your wise words. I found each post soothing and  
calming like a balm. I am in midst of crisis from all angles of life, I was  
more venting it out!   
Sometimes in crises one does not even know how to surrender to Sri Ramana. Its  
an abyss! Absolute darkness!   
Thanks once again to one and all

Nagarjuna come to my mind: In order to help prevent people from getting attached to the idea of nirvana,  
the Bodhisattva Nagarjuna stated: Samsara [i.e., the stream of conditioned existence] has nothing that  
distinguishes it from nirvana; nirvana has nothing that distinguishes it from  
samsara. The limit of nirvana is the limit of samsara; there is not even the  
subtlest something separating the two.   
\   
Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is found;   
The deeds are, but no doer of the deeds is there;   
Nirvana is, but not the man that enters it;   
The path is, but no traveller on it is seen

Once Viswanatha Swami's brother came to the Asramam for darshan   
of Bhagavan. He was a freedom fighter and he had just then been in   
prison. Obviously he was against casteism. At lunch, he wanted to   
sit with nonbrahmins! Bhagavan Ramana used to sit in between the brahmin and  
non brahmin rows, at right angles. Even today, there is   
a photograph, where He is sitting before plate leaf. Bhagavan Ramana told  
Viswanatha Swami: "Look! Desiring to sit with non brahmins to show that you  
are against castes, is itself a desire.   
Do not do that. Sit with me if you want!" Viswanatha Swami's brother  
sliently went to sit at brahmin's row. Bhagavan Ramana   
always showed that one should not deliberately desire any opposite   
views, just to prove one's point. Aspring Sannyasa, because Grahastha-ship is  
unmanageable is equally bad as desiring the opposite.   
Arunachala Siva.

dear subramanyaji,   
without trying to prove a point, desiring freedom thru self enquiry is the  
opposite of living in a state on "ignorance"/non-enquiry.   
to my limited understanding desire is essential to my progress just as it is a  
barrier to my progress.   
desiring to reach a state where i unite with self - self which is always there  
- may seem to be a contradiction.   
the fact is that desire is a motivating force for the unrealised.   
For the realised, of course, there may be no desire / no motivation.   
regards,   
vinita

## some questions -  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: March 28, 2009, 08:33:16 PM

I have some questions... I am aware its born out of despair... maybe some sort  
of urgency...   
1. Bhagawan realised in spite of any desire to realisation. He did not even have and idea about realisation but still whatever happened to him is absolutely involuntary. Why did it happen to him?   
2. Bhagawan had death experience when he realised Brahman. Does everyone undergo some kind of death experience to realise? it need not be the case I feel.   
What is true? Dvaita or Advaita or Visishtadvaita?   
1 Is there anything apart from me? is there a GOD apart from me? - Dvaita  
for I should pray to him and win his grace to realise myself?   
2 Is there the Higher Authority? and am I small part of him? -  
Visishtadvaita for I should pray for that Higher authority so that he graces  
small part of himself?   
3 Am I myself the only resort? No one there at all? Am I to search the SELF  
all by myself?   
What am I to do?   
When Bhagawan realised, he never bothered about Dvaita, Visishtadvaita or  
Advaita. It just happened to him even without his wanting it.   
Is realisation granted only to the unwanting souls?   
Many say Bhagawan had already worked out all his Karmas in his past birth, is  
there rebirth in reality in conventional terms? or it just happened to  
Bhagawan just like that?   
What do we believe and what do I not believe? What do I do?   
My enquiry does not seem to work for me... (Its more out of despair, I know I  
need to work more, but....)   
what to do? what to not do? how to just be? Who am I... I know the immediate  
answer from myself... find out this 'I' and and it will get merged into the  
eternal 'I' but.... its not happening... (maybe I have not enquired enough  
but)   
Why has this sprung... why has there a need to realise been created... if we  
are already that SELF always... I dont understand anything...   
I just hope and pray dvaitically advaitically visidhtadvaitically.....   
Nagaraj

Dear all,   
Thanks to one and all for all your wise words. I found each post soothing and  
calming like a balm. I am in midst of crisis from all angles of life, I was  
more venting it out!   
Sometimes in crises one does not even know how to surrender to Sri Ramana. Its  
an abyss! Absolute darkness!   
Thanks once again to one and all   
Nagaraj

What is called Samsara... is like the vast Himalayas. I feel being crushed  
under it. I am unable to bear the burden of Samsara.

Nagarjuna come to my mind: In order to help prevent people from getting attached to the idea of nirvana,  
the Bodhisattva Nagarjuna stated: Samsara [i.e., the stream of conditioned existence] has nothing that  
distinguishes it from nirvana; nirvana has nothing that distinguishes it from  
samsara. The limit of nirvana is the limit of samsara; there is not even the  
subtlest something separating the two.   
\   
Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is found;   
The deeds are, but no doer of the deeds is there;   
Nirvana is, but not the man that enters it;   
The path is, but no traveller on it is seen

Once Viswanatha Swami's brother came to the Asramam for darshan   
of Bhagavan. He was a freedom fighter and he had just then been in   
prison. Obviously he was against casteism. At lunch, he wanted to   
sit with nonbrahmins! Bhagavan Ramana used to sit in between the brahmin and  
non brahmin rows, at right angles. Even today, there is   
a photograph, where He is sitting before plate leaf. Bhagavan Ramana told  
Viswanatha Swami: "Look! Desiring to sit with non brahmins to show that you  
are against castes, is itself a desire.   
Do not do that. Sit with me if you want!" Viswanatha Swami's brother  
sliently went to sit at brahmin's row. Bhagavan Ramana   
always showed that one should not deliberately desire any opposite   
views, just to prove one's point. Aspring Sannyasa, because Grahastha-ship is  
unmanageable is equally bad as desiring the opposite.

dear subramanyaji,   
without trying to prove a point, desiring freedom thru self enquiry is the  
opposite of living in a state on "ignorance"/non-enquiry.   
to my limited understanding desire is essential to my progress just as it is a  
barrier to my progress.   
desiring to reach a state where i unite with self - self which is always there  
- may seem to be a contradiction.   
the fact is that desire is a motivating force for the unrealised.   
For the realised, of course, there may be no desire / no motivation.   
regards,   
vinita

## some questions -  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: March 28, 2009, 08:33:16 PM

I have some questions... I am aware its born out of despair... maybe some sort  
of urgency...   
1. Bhagawan realised in spite of any desire to realisation. He did not even have and idea about realisation but still whatever happened to him is absolutely involuntary. Why did it happen to him?   
2. Bhagawan had death experience when he realised Brahman. Does everyone undergo some kind of death experience to realise? it need not be the case I feel.   
What is true? Dvaita or Advaita or Visishtadvaita?   
1 Is there anything apart from me? is there a GOD apart from me? - Dvaita  
for I should pray to him and win his grace to realise myself?   
2 Is there the Higher Authority? and am I small part of him? -  
Visishtadvaita for I should pray for that Higher authority so that he graces  
small part of himself?   
3 Am I myself the only resort? No one there at all? Am I to search the SELF  
all by myself?   
What am I to do?   
When Bhagawan realised, he never bothered about Dvaita, Visishtadvaita or  
Advaita. It just happened to him even without his wanting it.   
Is realisation granted only to the unwanting souls?   
Many say Bhagawan had already worked out all his Karmas in his past birth, is  
there rebirth in reality in conventional terms? or it just happened to  
Bhagawan just like that?   
What do we believe and what do I not believe? What do I do?   
My enquiry does not seem to work for me... (Its more out of despair, I know I  
need to work more, but....)   
what to do? what to not do? how to just be? Who am I... I know the immediate  
answer from myself... find out this 'I' and and it will get merged into the  
eternal 'I' but.... its not happening... (maybe I have not enquired enough  
but)   
Why has this sprung... why has there a need to realise been created... if we  
are already that SELF always... I dont understand anything...   
I just hope and pray dvaitically advaitically visidhtadvaitically.....   
Nagaraj

Sometimes I also feel, I should stop my quest and keep all my books and  
spirituality in some box and just be... just doing my daily routine and  
chores... conventionally get entangled in worldly life and just wait for it to  
happen to me.... Bhagawan was completely engrossed in worldly life before he  
realised.... he used to play to his hearts content... etc...   
but again another thought runs... if I get entangled in worldly life... I am  
getting father away from spirituality....   
??

I always simply ask myself to listen tot he silence of bhagawan....this helps  
me alot   
it is like "please may I speak to the "Iam"   
and hten I simply rest in this..it helps me make the shift from believing Iam  
not this...into "Iam" this   
I just can say that in order to be it you have to be it....and no desire is an  
aid not even the pure desire of self realisaiton..   
and I thought about nirvikalpa samadhi yesterday....will it come? or will it  
not come and if it is neccessary...you know if you go deep into meditaiotn  
there arecertain points were it gets heavy...and fear comes up because the  
unknown is knocking on the door...   
I think due to personal growth and faith this hardships will end...   
but I do not know if nirvikalpha samadhi is a must or not...in case of the  
great spiritual giants it was always part of their awakening but in zen  
tradition lot of the masters never expereinced this...so I do not know

In Bhagavan Ramana's case, it was just one dive and He never returned. And  
that is why we call Him as an avatara of Skanda   
and Jnana Sambandha. But in most of our cases, the dive has to be   
done several times. Sometimes a pearl and some other times, a heap of mud and  
stone. Pereseverence and continued patience is the only way. You cannot  
throw away books or pictures or stop Arunachala visits just as you like.  
Perhaps after one year, you will take this back and re-start. Everything  
happens as per destiny. Desiring the Self is the only desire that we can  
have. The rest of them should be left to destiny or Guru.   
Bhagavan Ramana's philosphy is Advaita. He did not say it. Only after  
reading Sankara in Tiruvannamalai, He felt that his experience and Sankara's  
descriptions tallied. In fact, Bhagavan Ramana said   
about Ajata Vada of Gaudapada, Sankara's Guru's Guru. And that is more  
correct. But He never dis-approved dvaita or visishtadvaita. He said all  
paths lead to the royal road of Self enquiry. And that is why He never  
approved change of religion even to Westerners and Muslims and Sindhis. He  
said: "All you fellows, you will one day come to the royal road of self enquiry  
through various sub roads."   
Arunachala Siva.

dear nagaraj,   
doubt is very much a part of the search. the journey we have undertaken may  
appear to be difficult at times. the churning is so important so that  
something can emerge out of it. i think we should give value to our doubts  
too.   
the "Tat" of the "tat twam asi" is "tat" so far as we are not realised. There  
may not be any this or that or i or u once we become realised.   
so even when things appear to be confusing/not clear because in our experience  
we dont know what self is apart from what we read here or there or are told  
here and there....the search should continue, isn't it?   
Because THAT / TAT alone matters.......!   
love,   
vinita

I read some lines of augustinus the father of the church..just some moments  
before I read the post of vinita...   
he wrote we should start to doubt everything, step by step, then we will se  
that we can doubt our intellect...that we can even doubt the senses..because  
what we see,hear,taste etc. may ba a hallucination.....but then we will see  
that there must be something that doubts....something that can doubt but  
cannot be the object of out doubts...   
this we cannot doubt is this moment, the arising of what is...and augustinus  
concludes that god lives in this presence.....that this presence that is here  
right now is the way to god...   
what we read up there.... is advaita isnt it?   
neti neti and vichara...the way was always the same...ramana restored it so  
beautifull, so easy, so direct, like no one before him....   
we should thank him for this with all we can give int he present moment

In Sri Ramana Ashottaram, there is one Name: Prostrations to the One who swallowed all the doubts!   
This has become possible for Bhagavan Ramana as soon as He became   
self realized. Whereas, we are all haunted by torturing doubts, because we  
are not yet with the Goal. Sankara uses a word Vipareeta   
Sandheha in Vivekachoodamani. That is, even after the way has been   
taught, the disciple finds Sunya, emptiness, and started doubting the way  
itself! Then the Guru says, "Stay in that Sunya, without any doubts, the  
Effulgence would soon dawn!" I think, this sums up   
the whole matter.

getting father away from spirituality....

I always simply ask myself to listen tot he silence of bhagawan....this helps  
me alot   
it is like "please may I speak to the "Iam"   
and hten I simply rest in this..it helps me make the shift from believing Iam  
not this...into "Iam" this   
I just can say that in order to be it you have to be it....and no desire is an  
aid not even the pure desire of self realisaiton..   
and I thought about nirvikalpa samadhi yesterday....will it come? or will it  
not come and if it is neccessary...you know if you go deep into meditaiotn  
there arecertain points were it gets heavy...and fear comes up because the  
unknown is knocking on the door...   
I think due to personal growth and faith this hardships will end...   
but I do not know if nirvikalpha samadhi is a must or not...in case of the  
great spiritual giants it was always part of their awakening but in zen  
tradition lot of the masters never expereinced this...so I do not know

In Bhagavan Ramana's case, it was just one dive and He never returned. And  
that is why we call Him as an avatara of Skanda   
and Jnana Sambandha. But in most of our cases, the dive has to be   
done several times. Sometimes a pearl and some other times, a heap of mud and  
stone. Pereseverence and continued patience is the only way. You cannot  
throw away books or pictures or stop Arunachala visits just as you like.  
Perhaps after one year, you will take this back and re-start. Everything  
happens as per destiny. Desiring the Self is the only desire that we can  
have. The rest of them should be left to destiny or Guru.   
Bhagavan Ramana's philosphy is Advaita. He did not say it. Only after  
reading Sankara in Tiruvannamalai, He felt that his experience and Sankara's  
descriptions tallied. In fact, Bhagavan Ramana said   
about Ajata Vada of Gaudapada, Sankara's Guru's Guru. And that is more  
correct. But He never dis-approved dvaita or visishtadvaita. He said all  
paths lead to the royal road of Self enquiry. And that is why He never  
approved change of religion even to Westerners and Muslims and Sindhis. He  
said: "All you fellows, you will one day come to the royal road of self enquiry  
through various sub roads."   
Arunachala Siva.

My enquiry does not seem to work for me... (Its more out of despair, I know I  
need to work more, but....)   
what to do? what to not do? how to just be? Who am I... I know the immediate  
answer from myself... find out this 'I' and and it will get merged into the  
eternal 'I' but.... its not happening... (maybe I have not enquired enough  
but)   
Why has this sprung... why has there a need to realise been created... if we  
are already that SELF always... I dont understand anything...   
dear nagaraj,   
doubt is very much a part of the search. the journey we have undertaken may  
appear to be difficult at times. the churning is so important so that  
something can emerge out of it. i think we should give value to our doubts  
too.   
the "Tat" of the "tat twam asi" is "tat" so far as we are not realised. There  
may not be any this or that or i or u once we become realised.   
so even when things appear to be confusing/not clear because in our experience  
we dont know what self is apart from what we read here or there or are told  
here and there....the search should continue, isn't it?   
Because THAT / TAT alone matters.......!   
love,

I read some lines of augustinus the father of the church..just some moments  
before I read the post of vinita...   
he wrote we should start to doubt everything, step by step, then we will se  
that we can doubt our intellect...that we can even doubt the senses..because  
what we see,hear,taste etc. may ba a hallucination.....but then we will see  
that there must be something that doubts....something that can doubt but  
cannot be the object of out doubts...   
this we cannot doubt is this moment, the arising of what is...and augustinus  
concludes that god lives in this presence.....that this presence that is here  
right now is the way to god...   
what we read up there.... is advaita isnt it?   
neti neti and vichara...the way was always the same...ramana restored it so  
beautifull, so easy, so direct, like no one before him....   
we should thank him for this with all we can give int he present moment

In Sri Ramana Ashottaram, there is one Name: Prostrations to the One who swallowed all the doubts!   
This has become possible for Bhagavan Ramana as soon as He became   
self realized. Whereas, we are all haunted by torturing doubts, because we  
are not yet with the Goal. Sankara uses a word Vipareeta   
Sandheha in Vivekachoodamani. That is, even after the way has been   
taught, the disciple finds Sunya, emptiness, and started doubting the way  
itself! Then the Guru says, "Stay in that Sunya, without any doubts, the  
Effulgence would soon dawn!" I think, this sums up   
the whole matter.

Thanks to one and all for all your wise words. I found each post soothing and

Nagarjuna come to my mind: In order to help prevent people from getting attached to the idea of nirvana,  
the Bodhisattva Nagarjuna stated: Samsara [i.e., the stream of conditioned existence] has nothing that  
distinguishes it from nirvana; nirvana has nothing that distinguishes it from  
samsara. The limit of nirvana is the limit of samsara; there is not even the  
subtlest something separating the two.   
\   
Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is found;   
The deeds are, but no doer of the deeds is there;   
Nirvana is, but not the man that enters it;   
The path is, but no traveller on it is seen

Once Viswanatha Swami's brother came to the Asramam for darshan   
of Bhagavan. He was a freedom fighter and he had just then been in   
prison. Obviously he was against casteism. At lunch, he wanted to   
sit with nonbrahmins! Bhagavan Ramana used to sit in between the brahmin and  
non brahmin rows, at right angles. Even today, there is   
a photograph, where He is sitting before plate leaf. Bhagavan Ramana told  
Viswanatha Swami: "Look! Desiring to sit with non brahmins to show that you  
are against castes, is itself a desire.   
Do not do that. Sit with me if you want!" Viswanatha Swami's brother  
sliently went to sit at brahmin's row. Bhagavan Ramana   
always showed that one should not deliberately desire any opposite   
views, just to prove one's point. Aspring Sannyasa, because Grahastha-ship is  
unmanageable is equally bad as desiring the opposite.   
Arunachala Siva.

dear subramanyaji,   
without trying to prove a point, desiring freedom thru self enquiry is the  
opposite of living in a state on "ignorance"/non-enquiry.   
to my limited understanding desire is essential to my progress just as it is a  
barrier to my progress.   
desiring to reach a state where i unite with self - self which is always there  
- may seem to be a contradiction.   
the fact is that desire is a motivating force for the unrealised.   
For the realised, of course, there may be no desire / no motivation.   
regards,   
vinita

## some questions -  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: March 28, 2009, 08:33:16 PM

I have some questions... I am aware its born out of despair... maybe some sort  
of urgency...   
1. Bhagawan realised in spite of any desire to realisation. He did not even have and idea about realisation but still whatever happened to him is absolutely involuntary. Why did it happen to him?   
2. Bhagawan had death experience when he realised Brahman. Does everyone undergo some kind of death experience to realise? it need not be the case I feel.   
What is true? Dvaita or Advaita or Visishtadvaita?   
1 Is there anything apart from me? is there a GOD apart from me? - Dvaita  
for I should pray to him and win his grace to realise myself?   
2 Is there the Higher Authority? and am I small part of him? -  
Visishtadvaita for I should pray for that Higher authority so that he graces  
small part of himself?   
3 Am I myself the only resort? No one there at all? Am I to search the SELF  
all by myself?   
What am I to do?   
When Bhagawan realised, he never bothered about Dvaita, Visishtadvaita or  
Advaita. It just happened to him even without his wanting it.   
Is realisation granted only to the unwanting souls?   
Many say Bhagawan had already worked out all his Karmas in his past birth, is  
there rebirth in reality in conventional terms? or it just happened to  
Bhagawan just like that?   
What do we believe and what do I not believe? What do I do?   
My enquiry does not seem to work for me... (Its more out of despair, I know I  
need to work more, but....)   
what to do? what to not do? how to just be? Who am I... I know the immediate  
answer from myself... find out this 'I' and and it will get merged into the  
eternal 'I' but.... its not happening... (maybe I have not enquired enough  
but)   
Why has this sprung... why has there a need to realise been created... if we  
are already that SELF always... I dont understand anything...   
I just hope and pray dvaitically advaitically visidhtadvaitically.....   
Nagaraj

Sometimes I also feel, I should stop my quest and keep all my books and  
spirituality in some box and just be... just doing my daily routine and  
chores... conventionally get entangled in worldly life and just wait for it to  
happen to me.... Bhagawan was completely engrossed in worldly life before he

What is called Samsara... is like the vast Himalayas. I feel being crushed

Nagarjuna come to my mind: In order to help prevent people from getting attached to the idea of nirvana,  
the Bodhisattva Nagarjuna stated: Samsara [i.e., the stream of conditioned existence] has nothing that  
distinguishes it from nirvana; nirvana has nothing that distinguishes it from  
samsara. The limit of nirvana is the limit of samsara; there is not even the  
subtlest something separating the two.   
\   
Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is found;   
The deeds are, but no doer of the deeds is there;   
Nirvana is, but not the man that enters it;   
The path is, but no traveller on it is seen

Once Viswanatha Swami's brother came to the Asramam for darshan   
of Bhagavan. He was a freedom fighter and he had just then been in   
prison. Obviously he was against casteism. At lunch, he wanted to   
sit with nonbrahmins! Bhagavan Ramana used to sit in between the brahmin and  
non brahmin rows, at right angles. Even today, there is   
a photograph, where He is sitting before plate leaf. Bhagavan Ramana told  
Viswanatha Swami: "Look! Desiring to sit with non brahmins to show that you  
are against castes, is itself a desire.   
Do not do that. Sit with me if you want!" Viswanatha Swami's brother  
sliently went to sit at brahmin's row. Bhagavan Ramana   
always showed that one should not deliberately desire any opposite   
views, just to prove one's point. Aspring Sannyasa, because Grahastha-ship is  
unmanageable is equally bad as desiring the opposite.

dear subramanyaji,   
without trying to prove a point, desiring freedom thru self enquiry is the  
opposite of living in a state on "ignorance"/non-enquiry.   
to my limited understanding desire is essential to my progress just as it is a  
barrier to my progress.   
desiring to reach a state where i unite with self - self which is always there  
- may seem to be a contradiction.   
the fact is that desire is a motivating force for the unrealised.   
For the realised, of course, there may be no desire / no motivation.   
regards,   
vinita

## some questions -  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: March 28, 2009, 08:33:16 PM

I have some questions... I am aware its born out of despair... maybe some sort  
of urgency...   
1. Bhagawan realised in spite of any desire to realisation. He did not even have and idea about realisation but still whatever happened to him is absolutely involuntary. Why did it happen to him?   
2. Bhagawan had death experience when he realised Brahman. Does everyone undergo some kind of death experience to realise? it need not be the case I feel.   
What is true? Dvaita or Advaita or Visishtadvaita?   
1 Is there anything apart from me? is there a GOD apart from me? - Dvaita  
for I should pray to him and win his grace to realise myself?   
2 Is there the Higher Authority? and am I small part of him? -  
Visishtadvaita for I should pray for that Higher authority so that he graces  
small part of himself?   
3 Am I myself the only resort? No one there at all? Am I to search the SELF  
all by myself?   
What am I to do?   
When Bhagawan realised, he never bothered about Dvaita, Visishtadvaita or  
Advaita. It just happened to him even without his wanting it.   
Is realisation granted only to the unwanting souls?   
Many say Bhagawan had already worked out all his Karmas in his past birth, is  
there rebirth in reality in conventional terms? or it just happened to  
Bhagawan just like that?   
What do we believe and what do I not believe? What do I do?   
My enquiry does not seem to work for me... (Its more out of despair, I know I  
need to work more, but....)   
what to do? what to not do? how to just be? Who am I... I know the immediate  
answer from myself... find out this 'I' and and it will get merged into the  
eternal 'I' but.... its not happening... (maybe I have not enquired enough  
but)   
Why has this sprung... why has there a need to realise been created... if we  
are already that SELF always... I dont understand anything...   
I just hope and pray dvaitically advaitically visidhtadvaitically.....   
Nagaraj

Sometimes I also feel, I should stop my quest and keep all my books and  
spirituality in some box and just be... just doing my daily routine and  
chores... conventionally get entangled in worldly life and just wait for it to  
happen to me.... Bhagawan was completely engrossed in worldly life before he  
realised.... he used to play to his hearts content... etc...   
but again another thought runs... if I get entangled in worldly life... I am  
getting father away from spirituality....   
??

I always simply ask myself to listen tot he silence of bhagawan....this helps  
me alot   
it is like "please may I speak to the "Iam"   
and hten I simply rest in this..it helps me make the shift from believing Iam  
not this...into "Iam" this   
I just can say that in order to be it you have to be it....and no desire is an  
aid not even the pure desire of self realisaiton..   
and I thought about nirvikalpa samadhi yesterday....will it come? or will it  
not come and if it is neccessary...you know if you go deep into meditaiotn  
there arecertain points were it gets heavy...and fear comes up because the  
unknown is knocking on the door...   
I think due to personal growth and faith this hardships will end...   
but I do not know if nirvikalpha samadhi is a must or not...in case of the  
great spiritual giants it was always part of their awakening but in zen  
tradition lot of the masters never expereinced this...so I do not know

In Bhagavan Ramana's case, it was just one dive and He never returned. And  
that is why we call Him as an avatara of Skanda   
and Jnana Sambandha. But in most of our cases, the dive has to be   
done several times. Sometimes a pearl and some other times, a heap of mud and  
stone. Pereseverence and continued patience is the only way. You cannot  
throw away books or pictures or stop Arunachala visits just as you like.  
Perhaps after one year, you will take this back and re-start. Everything  
happens as per destiny. Desiring the Self is the only desire that we can  
have. The rest of them should be left to destiny or Guru.   
Bhagavan Ramana's philosphy is Advaita. He did not say it. Only after  
reading Sankara in Tiruvannamalai, He felt that his experience and Sankara's  
descriptions tallied. In fact, Bhagavan Ramana said   
about Ajata Vada of Gaudapada, Sankara's Guru's Guru. And that is more  
correct. But He never dis-approved dvaita or visishtadvaita. He said all  
paths lead to the royal road of Self enquiry. And that is why He never  
approved change of religion even to Westerners and Muslims and Sindhis. He  
said: "All you fellows, you will one day come to the royal road of self enquiry  
through various sub roads."   
Arunachala Siva.

dear nagaraj,   
doubt is very much a part of the search. the journey we have undertaken may  
appear to be difficult at times. the churning is so important so that  
something can emerge out of it. i think we should give value to our doubts  
too.   
the "Tat" of the "tat twam asi" is "tat" so far as we are not realised. There  
may not be any this or that or i or u once we become realised.   
so even when things appear to be confusing/not clear because in our experience  
we dont know what self is apart from what we read here or there or are told  
here and there....the search should continue, isn't it?   
Because THAT / TAT alone matters.......!   
love,   
vinita

I read some lines of augustinus the father of the church..just some moments  
before I read the post of vinita...   
he wrote we should start to doubt everything, step by step, then we will se  
that we can doubt our intellect...that we can even doubt the senses..because  
what we see,hear,taste etc. may ba a hallucination.....but then we will see  
that there must be something that doubts....something that can doubt but  
cannot be the object of out doubts...   
this we cannot doubt is this moment, the arising of what is...and augustinus  
concludes that god lives in this presence.....that this presence that is here  
right now is the way to god...   
what we read up there.... is advaita isnt it?   
neti neti and vichara...the way was always the same...ramana restored it so  
beautifull, so easy, so direct, like no one before him....   
we should thank him for this with all we can give int he present moment

In Sri Ramana Ashottaram, there is one Name: Prostrations to the One who swallowed all the doubts!   
This has become possible for Bhagavan Ramana as soon as He became   
self realized. Whereas, we are all haunted by torturing doubts, because we  
are not yet with the Goal. Sankara uses a word Vipareeta   
Sandheha in Vivekachoodamani. That is, even after the way has been   
taught, the disciple finds Sunya, emptiness, and started doubting the way  
itself! Then the Guru says, "Stay in that Sunya, without any doubts, the  
Effulgence would soon dawn!" I think, this sums up   
the whole matter.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear all,   
Thanks to one and all for all your wise words. I found each post soothing and  
calming like a balm. I am in midst of crisis from all angles of life, I was  
more venting it out!   
Sometimes in crises one does not even know how to surrender to Sri Ramana. Its  
an abyss! Absolute darkness!   
Thanks once again to one and all

Dear vinita,   
I was also having the same view as you are now having. There was   
an blog item under Desiring the Self, by David Godman in his blog.   
Several advanced seekers gave their views both ways. I was also   
one of them. Finally David Godman concluded with many many   
quotations from Bhagavan Ramana Himself that Desiring the Self   
is the only desire one seeker can have. He also quoted from   
Annamalai Swami - Final Talks, where Annamalai Swami says this   
as a reply from Bhagavan Ramana for specific questions by seekers   
at that time. He says it is like taking steps towards market. But before  
starting you should have a desire to go to market. Thereafter,   
you do not desire it at every step on the road that you take. Kindly   
see davidgodman.org.   
Arunachala Siva.

Self realized Jnanis do have desires. Bhagavan Ramana says that   
such desires are of routine nature, like being hungry and desiring   
food, or being thirsty and desiring water, nature calls, bathing etc.,   
He may even have some desires outside, like Bhagavan Ramana   
taking additional cups of Malayalam Kanji and aviyal on one occasion.   
These desires do not bear any good or bad effects, nor create further   
desires. These are like 'burnt coir rope'. It has form but no use.

Dear All,   
For doing karma desire is must.   
Without desire no one can do any karma.   
But as bhagavan ramana says   
Small desires such as the desire to eat, drink and sleep and attend to calls  
of nature, though these may also be classed among desires, you can safely  
satisfy. They will not implant vasanas in your mind, necessitating further  
birth. Those activities are just necessary to carry on life and are not likely  
to develop or leave behind vasanas or tendencies. **As a general rule,

So there is wrong to have desires. Ok. then when does it become vasana?   
Is it necessary to think when we eat that, to realise who I am, this body is  
necessary so to preserve this body I am eating. Like this, all the necessaries  
to be done is it? They say anything we do repeatedly it forms a habit which  
will come clutch.   
2nd there is one statement.. you do whatever u can but do not have doership.   
Whatever it may be the incompletness within us is driving everyone to find  
out where it can be fullfilled.   
Here in this forum, senior seekers posted actually we are not incomplete. It

Dear Nagaraj, I think everything you are going trough is natural. Also,i  
believe,everyone have its own way,path. You shud ajust your practice according  
to your tendencies. You shudnt think that much about realisation,and when it  
will happen. Just believe,have faith,know that your are going in right

Dear Ramanaduli Garu,   
Vasanas is wishing or desiring to do the same action again and again i.e  
creating impressions in our mind which will create further boandage in our  
life.   
As said in Bhagavad Gita Ch3 text13   
Quote  
The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat  
food which is offered first for sacrifice. Others, who prepare food for  
personal sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin.  
So while eating we should treat food as prasad of god.   
As Bhagavan ramana says Small desires such as the desire to eat, drink and  
sleep and attend to calls of nature, though these may also be classed among  
desires, you can safely satisfy.

Vasanas accrure by continuing a desire throughout the life and still   
remaining unfulfilled even at the time of death. Suppose you take   
a glass of water and add graphite powder. The powder mixed with   
water would look blackish. After sometime, the graphite powder   
goes to the bottom of the glass and water become clear. You decant   
the water. After clearing the water, you will find the graphite powder   
sticking to the base of the glass, like a thick tar. This is vasanas.

Dear Nagaraj,   
 That perhaps means, you are trying too hard. Relax.   
If needed spend time on something else. May be watch a movie. And then get  
back to it. All in good time, they say.   
I know you understand all this pretty well, but still.

You are Consciousness -- no where to go, nothing to do. Do not try to

work. When the urge to "Reach it" is there, in mind. .. one need not obey this

Dear All,   
For doing karma desire is must.   
Without desire no one can do any karma.   
But as bhagavan ramana says   
Small desires such as the desire to eat, drink and sleep and attend to calls  
of nature, though these may also be classed among desires, you can safely  
satisfy. They will not implant vasanas in your mind, necessitating further  
birth. Those activities are just necessary to carry on life and are not likely  
to develop or leave behind vasanas or tendencies. **As a general rule,  
therefore, there is no harm in satisfying a desire where the satisfaction will  
not lead to further desires by creating vasanas in the mind.** (Day by Day  
with Bhagavan, 12th April, 1946)

Dear All,   
For doing karma desire is must.   
Without desire no one can do any karma.   
But as bhagavan ramana says   
Small desires such as the desire to eat, drink and sleep and attend to calls  
of nature, though these may also be classed among desires, you can safely  
satisfy. They will not implant vasanas in your mind, necessitating further  
birth. Those activities are just necessary to carry on life and are not likely  
to develop or leave behind vasanas or tendencies. **As a general rule,  
therefore, there is no harm in satisfying a desire where the satisfaction will  
not lead to further desires by creating vasanas in the mind.** (Day by Day  
with Bhagavan, 12th April, 1946)

So there is wrong to have desires. Ok. then when does it become vasana?   
Is it necessary to think when we eat that, to realise who I am, this body is  
necessary so to preserve this body I am eating. Like this, all the necessaries  
to be done is it? They say anything we do repeatedly it forms a habit which  
will come clutch.   
2nd there is one statement.. you do whatever u can but do not have doership.   
Whatever it may be the incompletness within us is driving everyone to find  
out where it can be fullfilled.   
Here in this forum, senior seekers posted actually we are not incomplete. It  
is the mind's play.   
When the mind becomes still there is no problem only the finder will be there.

Dear Nagaraj, I think everything you are going trough is natural. Also,i  
believe,everyone have its own way,path. You shud ajust your practice according  
to your tendencies. You shudnt think that much about realisation,and when it  
will happen. Just believe,have faith,know that your are going in right  
direction,and dont bother when it will finish. Shure,life is hard,and all that  
is easy to say.But like Vivekananda many times said Be brave!Be bold!Be

Dear Ramanaduli Garu,   
Vasanas is wishing or desiring to do the same action again and again i.e  
creating impressions in our mind which will create further boandage in our  
life.   
As said in Bhagavad Gita Ch3 text13   
Quote  
The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat  
food which is offered first for sacrifice. Others, who prepare food for  
personal sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin.  
So while eating we should treat food as prasad of god.   
As Bhagavan ramana says Small desires such as the desire to eat, drink and  
sleep and attend to calls of nature, though these may also be classed among  
desires, you can safely satisfy.

Vasanas accrure by continuing a desire throughout the life and still   
remaining unfulfilled even at the time of death. Suppose you take   
a glass of water and add graphite powder. The powder mixed with   
water would look blackish. After sometime, the graphite powder   
goes to the bottom of the glass and water become clear. You decant   
the water. After clearing the water, you will find the graphite powder   
sticking to the base of the glass, like a thick tar. This is vasanas.

Dear Nagaraj,   
 That perhaps means, you are trying too hard. Relax.   
If needed spend time on something else. May be watch a movie. And then get  
back to it. All in good time, they say.

You are Consciousness -- no where to go, nothing to do. Do not try to

an blog item under Desiring the Self, by David Godman in his blog.   
Several advanced seekers gave their views both ways. I was also   
one of them. Finally David Godman concluded with many many   
quotations from Bhagavan Ramana Himself that Desiring the Self   
is the only desire one seeker can have. He also quoted from   
Annamalai Swami - Final Talks, where Annamalai Swami says this   
as a reply from Bhagavan Ramana for specific questions by seekers   
at that time. He says it is like taking steps towards market. But before  
starting you should have a desire to go to market. Thereafter,   
you do not desire it at every step on the road that you take. Kindly

Self realized Jnanis do have desires. Bhagavan Ramana says that   
such desires are of routine nature, like being hungry and desiring   
food, or being thirsty and desiring water, nature calls, bathing etc.,   
He may even have some desires outside, like Bhagavan Ramana   
taking additional cups of Malayalam Kanji and aviyal on one occasion.   
These desires do not bear any good or bad effects, nor create further   
desires. These are like 'burnt coir rope'. It has form but no use.

Self realized Jnanis do have desires. Bhagavan Ramana says that   
such desires are of routine nature, like being hungry and desiring   
food, or being thirsty and desiring water, nature calls, bathing etc.,   
He may even have some desires outside, like Bhagavan Ramana   
taking additional cups of Malayalam Kanji and aviyal on one occasion.   
These desires do not bear any good or bad effects, nor create further   
desires. These are like 'burnt coir rope'. It has form but no use.

Dear All,   
For doing karma desire is must.   
Without desire no one can do any karma.   
But as bhagavan ramana says   
Small desires such as the desire to eat, drink and sleep and attend to calls  
of nature, though these may also be classed among desires, you can safely  
satisfy. They will not implant vasanas in your mind, necessitating further  
birth. Those activities are just necessary to carry on life and are not likely  
to develop or leave behind vasanas or tendencies. **As a general rule,  
therefore, there is no harm in satisfying a desire where the satisfaction will  
not lead to further desires by creating vasanas in the mind.** (Day by Day  
with Bhagavan, 12th April, 1946)

So there is wrong to have desires. Ok. then when does it become vasana?   
Is it necessary to think when we eat that, to realise who I am, this body is  
necessary so to preserve this body I am eating. Like this, all the necessaries  
to be done is it? They say anything we do repeatedly it forms a habit which  
will come clutch.   
2nd there is one statement.. you do whatever u can but do not have doership.   
Whatever it may be the incompletness within us is driving everyone to find  
out where it can be fullfilled.   
Here in this forum, senior seekers posted actually we are not incomplete. It  
is the mind's play.   
When the mind becomes still there is no problem only the finder will be there.

Dear Nagaraj, I think everything you are going trough is natural. Also,i  
believe,everyone have its own way,path. You shud ajust your practice according  
to your tendencies. You shudnt think that much about realisation,and when it  
will happen. Just believe,have faith,know that your are going in right

Dear Ramanaduli Garu,   
Vasanas is wishing or desiring to do the same action again and again i.e  
creating impressions in our mind which will create further boandage in our  
life.   
As said in Bhagavad Gita Ch3 text13   
Quote  
The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat  
food which is offered first for sacrifice. Others, who prepare food for  
personal sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin.  
So while eating we should treat food as prasad of god.   
As Bhagavan ramana says Small desires such as the desire to eat, drink and  
sleep and attend to calls of nature, though these may also be classed among  
desires, you can safely satisfy.

Vasanas accrure by continuing a desire throughout the life and still   
remaining unfulfilled even at the time of death. Suppose you take   
a glass of water and add graphite powder. The powder mixed with   
water would look blackish. After sometime, the graphite powder   
goes to the bottom of the glass and water become clear. You decant   
the water. After clearing the water, you will find the graphite powder   
sticking to the base of the glass, like a thick tar. This is vasanas.

Dear Nagaraj,   
 That perhaps means, you are trying too hard. Relax.   
If needed spend time on something else. May be watch a movie. And then get  
back to it. All in good time, they say.   
I know you understand all this pretty well, but still.

You are Consciousness -- no where to go, nothing to do. Do not try to

work. When the urge to "Reach it" is there, in mind. .. one need not obey this

Dear vinita,   
I was also having the same view as you are now having. There was   
an blog item under Desiring the Self, by David Godman in his blog.   
Several advanced seekers gave their views both ways. I was also   
one of them. Finally David Godman concluded with many many   
quotations from Bhagavan Ramana Himself that Desiring the Self   
is the only desire one seeker can have. He also quoted from   
Annamalai Swami - Final Talks, where Annamalai Swami says this   
as a reply from Bhagavan Ramana for specific questions by seekers   
at that time. He says it is like taking steps towards market. But before  
starting you should have a desire to go to market. Thereafter,   
you do not desire it at every step on the road that you take. Kindly   
see davidgodman.org.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear vinita,   
I was also having the same view as you are now having. There was   
an blog item under Desiring the Self, by David Godman in his blog.   
Several advanced seekers gave their views both ways. I was also   
one of them. Finally David Godman concluded with many many   
quotations from Bhagavan Ramana Himself that Desiring the Self   
is the only desire one seeker can have. He also quoted from   
Annamalai Swami - Final Talks, where Annamalai Swami says this   
as a reply from Bhagavan Ramana for specific questions by seekers   
at that time. He says it is like taking steps towards market. But before  
starting you should have a desire to go to market. Thereafter,   
you do not desire it at every step on the road that you take. Kindly   
see davidgodman.org.   
Arunachala Siva.

Self realized Jnanis do have desires. Bhagavan Ramana says that   
such desires are of routine nature, like being hungry and desiring   
food, or being thirsty and desiring water, nature calls, bathing etc.,   
He may even have some desires outside, like Bhagavan Ramana   
taking additional cups of Malayalam Kanji and aviyal on one occasion.   
These desires do not bear any good or bad effects, nor create further   
desires. These are like 'burnt coir rope'. It has form but no use.

Dear All,   
For doing karma desire is must.   
Without desire no one can do any karma.   
But as bhagavan ramana says   
Small desires such as the desire to eat, drink and sleep and attend to calls  
of nature, though these may also be classed among desires, you can safely  
satisfy. They will not implant vasanas in your mind, necessitating further  
birth. Those activities are just necessary to carry on life and are not likely  
to develop or leave behind vasanas or tendencies. **As a general rule,  
therefore, there is no harm in satisfying a desire where the satisfaction will  
not lead to further desires by creating vasanas in the mind.** (Day by Day  
with Bhagavan, 12th April, 1946)

So there is wrong to have desires. Ok. then when does it become vasana?   
Is it necessary to think when we eat that, to realise who I am, this body is  
necessary so to preserve this body I am eating. Like this, all the necessaries  
to be done is it? They say anything we do repeatedly it forms a habit which  
will come clutch.   
2nd there is one statement.. you do whatever u can but do not have doership.   
Whatever it may be the incompletness within us is driving everyone to find  
out where it can be fullfilled.   
Here in this forum, senior seekers posted actually we are not incomplete. It  
is the mind's play.

Dear Nagaraj, I think everything you are going trough is natural. Also,i  
believe,everyone have its own way,path. You shud ajust your practice according  
to your tendencies. You shudnt think that much about realisation,and when it

Dear Ramanaduli Garu,   
Vasanas is wishing or desiring to do the same action again and again i.e  
creating impressions in our mind which will create further boandage in our  
life.   
As said in Bhagavad Gita Ch3 text13   
Quote  
The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat  
food which is offered first for sacrifice. Others, who prepare food for  
personal sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin.  
So while eating we should treat food as prasad of god.   
As Bhagavan ramana says Small desires such as the desire to eat, drink and  
sleep and attend to calls of nature, though these may also be classed among  
desires, you can safely satisfy.

Vasanas accrure by continuing a desire throughout the life and still   
remaining unfulfilled even at the time of death. Suppose you take   
a glass of water and add graphite powder. The powder mixed with   
water would look blackish. After sometime, the graphite powder   
goes to the bottom of the glass and water become clear. You decant   
the water. After clearing the water, you will find the graphite powder   
sticking to the base of the glass, like a thick tar. This is vasanas.

Dear Nagaraj,   
 That perhaps means, you are trying too hard. Relax.   
If needed spend time on something else. May be watch a movie. And then get  
back to it. All in good time, they say.   
I know you understand all this pretty well, but still.

You are Consciousness -- no where to go, nothing to do. Do not try to  
eliminate something, nor try to make something happen. just continue your  
work. When the urge to "Reach it" is there, in mind. .. one need not obey this  
urge. the urge says "I have to reach", thats a suggestion in mind, not a  
command. we need not obey.

You are correct, thanks for your response. but I had that question in march

which is consciousness. all along the ignorance was made believed that it was

Dear I,   
You are correct, thanks for your response. but I had that question in march  
2009. I see "That" which has not changed all through passage of time so long  
which is consciousness. all along the ignorance was made believed that it was  
mine. but the 'I' which had those ignorance is limited.   
'I' am simply aware of i's limitedness

Dear vinita,   
I was also having the same view as you are now having. There was   
an blog item under Desiring the Self, by David Godman in his blog.   
Several advanced seekers gave their views both ways. I was also   
one of them. Finally David Godman concluded with many many   
quotations from Bhagavan Ramana Himself that Desiring the Self   
is the only desire one seeker can have. He also quoted from   
Annamalai Swami - Final Talks, where Annamalai Swami says this   
as a reply from Bhagavan Ramana for specific questions by seekers   
at that time. He says it is like taking steps towards market. But before  
starting you should have a desire to go to market. Thereafter,   
you do not desire it at every step on the road that you take. Kindly   
see davidgodman.org.   
Arunachala Siva.

Self realized Jnanis do have desires. Bhagavan Ramana says that   
such desires are of routine nature, like being hungry and desiring   
food, or being thirsty and desiring water, nature calls, bathing etc.,   
He may even have some desires outside, like Bhagavan Ramana   
taking additional cups of Malayalam Kanji and aviyal on one occasion.   
These desires do not bear any good or bad effects, nor create further   
desires. These are like 'burnt coir rope'. It has form but no use.

Dear All,   
For doing karma desire is must.   
Without desire no one can do any karma.   
But as bhagavan ramana says   
Small desires such as the desire to eat, drink and sleep and attend to calls  
of nature, though these may also be classed among desires, you can safely  
satisfy. They will not implant vasanas in your mind, necessitating further  
birth. Those activities are just necessary to carry on life and are not likely  
to develop or leave behind vasanas or tendencies. **As a general rule,  
therefore, there is no harm in satisfying a desire where the satisfaction will  
not lead to further desires by creating vasanas in the mind.** (Day by Day  
with Bhagavan, 12th April, 1946)

So there is wrong to have desires. Ok. then when does it become vasana?   
Is it necessary to think when we eat that, to realise who I am, this body is  
necessary so to preserve this body I am eating. Like this, all the necessaries  
to be done is it? They say anything we do repeatedly it forms a habit which  
will come clutch.   
2nd there is one statement.. you do whatever u can but do not have doership.   
Whatever it may be the incompletness within us is driving everyone to find  
out where it can be fullfilled.

Dear Nagaraj, I think everything you are going trough is natural. Also,i  
believe,everyone have its own way,path. You shud ajust your practice according  
to your tendencies. You shudnt think that much about realisation,and when it  
will happen. Just believe,have faith,know that your are going in right

Dear Ramanaduli Garu,   
Vasanas is wishing or desiring to do the same action again and again i.e  
creating impressions in our mind which will create further boandage in our  
life.   
As said in Bhagavad Gita Ch3 text13   
Quote  
The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat  
food which is offered first for sacrifice. Others, who prepare food for  
personal sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin.  
So while eating we should treat food as prasad of god.   
As Bhagavan ramana says Small desires such as the desire to eat, drink and  
sleep and attend to calls of nature, though these may also be classed among  
desires, you can safely satisfy.

Vasanas accrure by continuing a desire throughout the life and still   
remaining unfulfilled even at the time of death. Suppose you take   
a glass of water and add graphite powder. The powder mixed with   
water would look blackish. After sometime, the graphite powder   
goes to the bottom of the glass and water become clear. You decant   
the water. After clearing the water, you will find the graphite powder   
sticking to the base of the glass, like a thick tar. This is vasanas.

Dear Nagaraj,   
 That perhaps means, you are trying too hard. Relax.   
If needed spend time on something else. May be watch a movie. And then get  
back to it. All in good time, they say.   
I know you understand all this pretty well, but still.

from body and remain relaxed in Self]   
Adhunaiva sukhi shanto, Bandha mukto bhavishyathi [Immediately you shall be  
Blissful, Peaceful and released from all bondage].   
You are Consciousness -- no where to go, nothing to do. Do not try to  
eliminate something, nor try to make something happen. just continue your  
work. When the urge to "Reach it" is there, in mind. .. one need not obey this  
urge. the urge says "I have to reach", thats a suggestion in mind, not a  
command. we need not obey.   
This is my view.

 That perhaps means, you are trying too hard. Relax.   
If needed spend time on something else. May be watch a movie. And then get  
back to it. All in good time, they say.   
I know you understand all this pretty well, but still.   
"Inquiry is not working" \-- what way is it expected to work?   
Yadi Deham Prtak Krithya, Chitti Vishramya tistasi [If you detach yourself  
from body and remain relaxed in Self]   
Adhunaiva sukhi shanto, Bandha mukto bhavishyathi [Immediately you shall be  
Blissful, Peaceful and released from all bondage].   
You are Consciousness -- no where to go, nothing to do. Do not try to  
eliminate something, nor try to make something happen. just continue your  
work. When the urge to "Reach it" is there, in mind. .. one need not obey this  
urge. the urge says "I have to reach", thats a suggestion in mind, not a  
command. we need not obey.   
This is my view.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear I,   
You are correct, thanks for your response. but I had that question in march  
2009. I see "That" which has not changed all through passage of time so long  
which is consciousness. all along the ignorance was made believed that it was  
mine. but the 'I' which had those ignorance is limited.   
'I' am simply aware of i's limitedness

Dear vinita,   
I was also having the same view as you are now having. There was   
an blog item under Desiring the Self, by David Godman in his blog.   
Several advanced seekers gave their views both ways. I was also   
one of them. Finally David Godman concluded with many many   
quotations from Bhagavan Ramana Himself that Desiring the Self   
is the only desire one seeker can have. He also quoted from   
Annamalai Swami - Final Talks, where Annamalai Swami says this   
as a reply from Bhagavan Ramana for specific questions by seekers   
at that time. He says it is like taking steps towards market. But before  
starting you should have a desire to go to market. Thereafter,   
you do not desire it at every step on the road that you take. Kindly   
see davidgodman.org.   
Arunachala Siva.

Self realized Jnanis do have desires. Bhagavan Ramana says that   
such desires are of routine nature, like being hungry and desiring   
food, or being thirsty and desiring water, nature calls, bathing etc.,   
He may even have some desires outside, like Bhagavan Ramana   
taking additional cups of Malayalam Kanji and aviyal on one occasion.   
These desires do not bear any good or bad effects, nor create further   
desires. These are like 'burnt coir rope'. It has form but no use.

Dear All,   
For doing karma desire is must.   
Without desire no one can do any karma.   
But as bhagavan ramana says   
Small desires such as the desire to eat, drink and sleep and attend to calls  
of nature, though these may also be classed among desires, you can safely  
satisfy. They will not implant vasanas in your mind, necessitating further  
birth. Those activities are just necessary to carry on life and are not likely  
to develop or leave behind vasanas or tendencies. **As a general rule,  
therefore, there is no harm in satisfying a desire where the satisfaction will  
not lead to further desires by creating vasanas in the mind.** (Day by Day  
with Bhagavan, 12th April, 1946)

So there is wrong to have desires. Ok. then when does it become vasana?   
Is it necessary to think when we eat that, to realise who I am, this body is  
necessary so to preserve this body I am eating. Like this, all the necessaries  
to be done is it? They say anything we do repeatedly it forms a habit which  
will come clutch.   
2nd there is one statement.. you do whatever u can but do not have doership.   
Whatever it may be the incompletness within us is driving everyone to find

Dear Nagaraj, I think everything you are going trough is natural. Also,i

Dear Ramanaduli Garu,   
Vasanas is wishing or desiring to do the same action again and again i.e  
creating impressions in our mind which will create further boandage in our  
life.   
As said in Bhagavad Gita Ch3 text13   
Quote  
The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat  
food which is offered first for sacrifice. Others, who prepare food for  
personal sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin.  
So while eating we should treat food as prasad of god.   
As Bhagavan ramana says Small desires such as the desire to eat, drink and  
sleep and attend to calls of nature, though these may also be classed among  
desires, you can safely satisfy.

Vasanas accrure by continuing a desire throughout the life and still   
remaining unfulfilled even at the time of death. Suppose you take   
a glass of water and add graphite powder. The powder mixed with   
water would look blackish. After sometime, the graphite powder   
goes to the bottom of the glass and water become clear. You decant   
the water. After clearing the water, you will find the graphite powder   
sticking to the base of the glass, like a thick tar. This is vasanas.

Dear Nagaraj,   
 That perhaps means, you are trying too hard. Relax.   
If needed spend time on something else. May be watch a movie. And then get  
back to it. All in good time, they say.   
I know you understand all this pretty well, but still.   
"Inquiry is not working" \-- what way is it expected to work?   
Yadi Deham Prtak Krithya, Chitti Vishramya tistasi [If you detach yourself  
from body and remain relaxed in Self]   
Adhunaiva sukhi shanto, Bandha mukto bhavishyathi [Immediately you shall be  
Blissful, Peaceful and released from all bondage].   
You are Consciousness -- no where to go, nothing to do. Do not try to  
eliminate something, nor try to make something happen. just continue your  
work. When the urge to "Reach it" is there, in mind. .. one need not obey this  
urge. the urge says "I have to reach", thats a suggestion in mind, not a  
command. we need not obey.   
This is my view.   
Love!

Dear I,   
You are correct, thanks for your response. but I had that question in march  
2009. I see "That" which has not changed all through passage of time so long  
which is consciousness. all along the ignorance was made believed that it was

Dear vinita,   
I was also having the same view as you are now having. There was   
an blog item under Desiring the Self, by David Godman in his blog.   
Several advanced seekers gave their views both ways. I was also   
one of them. Finally David Godman concluded with many many   
quotations from Bhagavan Ramana Himself that Desiring the Self   
is the only desire one seeker can have. He also quoted from   
Annamalai Swami - Final Talks, where Annamalai Swami says this   
as a reply from Bhagavan Ramana for specific questions by seekers   
at that time. He says it is like taking steps towards market. But before  
starting you should have a desire to go to market. Thereafter,   
you do not desire it at every step on the road that you take. Kindly   
see davidgodman.org.   
Arunachala Siva.

Self realized Jnanis do have desires. Bhagavan Ramana says that   
such desires are of routine nature, like being hungry and desiring   
food, or being thirsty and desiring water, nature calls, bathing etc.,   
He may even have some desires outside, like Bhagavan Ramana   
taking additional cups of Malayalam Kanji and aviyal on one occasion.   
These desires do not bear any good or bad effects, nor create further   
desires. These are like 'burnt coir rope'. It has form but no use.

Dear All,   
For doing karma desire is must.   
Without desire no one can do any karma.   
But as bhagavan ramana says   
Small desires such as the desire to eat, drink and sleep and attend to calls  
of nature, though these may also be classed among desires, you can safely  
satisfy. They will not implant vasanas in your mind, necessitating further  
birth. Those activities are just necessary to carry on life and are not likely  
to develop or leave behind vasanas or tendencies. **As a general rule,  
therefore, there is no harm in satisfying a desire where the satisfaction will  
not lead to further desires by creating vasanas in the mind.** (Day by Day  
with Bhagavan, 12th April, 1946)

So there is wrong to have desires. Ok. then when does it become vasana?   
Is it necessary to think when we eat that, to realise who I am, this body is  
necessary so to preserve this body I am eating. Like this, all the necessaries  
to be done is it? They say anything we do repeatedly it forms a habit which  
will come clutch.   
2nd there is one statement.. you do whatever u can but do not have doership.   
Whatever it may be the incompletness within us is driving everyone to find  
out where it can be fullfilled.   
Here in this forum, senior seekers posted actually we are not incomplete. It  
is the mind's play.   
When the mind becomes still there is no problem only the finder will be there.

Dear Nagaraj, I think everything you are going trough is natural. Also,i  
believe,everyone have its own way,path. You shud ajust your practice according  
to your tendencies. You shudnt think that much about realisation,and when it  
will happen. Just believe,have faith,know that your are going in right  
direction,and dont bother when it will finish. Shure,life is hard,and all that  
is easy to say.But like Vivekananda many times said Be brave!Be bold!Be  
strong!Be brave!Be a hero! You will find yourself!Anyway,its our destiny.

Dear Ramanaduli Garu,   
Vasanas is wishing or desiring to do the same action again and again i.e  
creating impressions in our mind which will create further boandage in our  
life.   
As said in Bhagavad Gita Ch3 text13   
Quote  
The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat  
food which is offered first for sacrifice. Others, who prepare food for  
personal sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin.  
So while eating we should treat food as prasad of god.   
As Bhagavan ramana says Small desires such as the desire to eat, drink and  
sleep and attend to calls of nature, though these may also be classed among  
desires, you can safely satisfy.

Vasanas accrure by continuing a desire throughout the life and still   
remaining unfulfilled even at the time of death. Suppose you take   
a glass of water and add graphite powder. The powder mixed with   
water would look blackish. After sometime, the graphite powder   
goes to the bottom of the glass and water become clear. You decant   
the water. After clearing the water, you will find the graphite powder   
sticking to the base of the glass, like a thick tar. This is vasanas.

There is shiva geetha which was taught to Rama by Agasthya. If anybody knows I  
request to write on this Geetha.   
I came to know that Chandra sekara kurukkal has published this book. It says  
how to worship shiva and get His grace.Rama did this puja and vrath and got  
Pasupada asthra. In the same way Agasthya taught Athiya Hridhayam also. Being  
a avathar Rama followed all the rules and rites but where the people do nt  
follow anything. Rama shows sadhana and faith is very important.

## some questions -  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: March 28, 2009, 08:33:16 PM  
---  
I have some questions... I am aware its born out of despair... maybe some sort  
of urgency...   
1. Bhagawan realised in spite of any desire to realisation. He did not even have and idea about realisation but still whatever happened to him is absolutely involuntary. Why did it happen to him?   
2. Bhagawan had death experience when he realised Brahman. Does everyone undergo some kind of death experience to realise? it need not be the case I feel.   
What is true? Dvaita or Advaita or Visishtadvaita?   
1 Is there anything apart from me? is there a GOD apart from me? - Dvaita  
for I should pray to him and win his grace to realise myself?   
2 Is there the Higher Authority? and am I small part of him? -  
Visishtadvaita for I should pray for that Higher authority so that he graces  
small part of himself?   
3 Am I myself the only resort? No one there at all? Am I to search the SELF  
all by myself?   
What am I to do?   
When Bhagawan realised, he never bothered about Dvaita, Visishtadvaita or  
Advaita. It just happened to him even without his wanting it.   
Is realisation granted only to the unwanting souls?   
Many say Bhagawan had already worked out all his Karmas in his past birth, is  
there rebirth in reality in conventional terms? or it just happened to  
Bhagawan just like that?   
What do we believe and what do I not believe? What do I do?   
My enquiry does not seem to work for me... (Its more out of despair, I know I  
need to work more, but....)   
what to do? what to not do? how to just be? Who am I... I know the immediate  
answer from myself... find out this 'I' and and it will get merged into the  
eternal 'I' but.... its not happening... (maybe I have not enquired enough  
but)   
Why has this sprung... why has there a need to realise been created... if we  
are already that SELF always... I dont understand anything...   
I just hope and pray dvaitically advaitically visidhtadvaitically.....

Sometimes I also feel, I should stop my quest and keep all my books and  
spirituality in some box and just be... just doing my daily routine and  
chores... conventionally get entangled in worldly life and just wait for it to  
happen to me.... Bhagawan was completely engrossed in worldly life before he  
realised.... he used to play to his hearts content... etc...   
but again another thought runs... if I get entangled in worldly life... I am  
getting father away from spirituality....

I always simply ask myself to listen tot he silence of bhagawan....this helps  
me alot   
it is like "please may I speak to the "Iam"   
and hten I simply rest in this..it helps me make the shift from believing Iam  
not this...into "Iam" this   
I just can say that in order to be it you have to be it....and no desire is an  
aid not even the pure desire of self realisaiton..   
and I thought about nirvikalpa samadhi yesterday....will it come? or will it  
not come and if it is neccessary...you know if you go deep into meditaiotn  
there arecertain points were it gets heavy...and fear comes up because the  
unknown is knocking on the door...   
I think due to personal growth and faith this hardships will end...   
but I do not know if nirvikalpha samadhi is a must or not...in case of the  
great spiritual giants it was always part of their awakening but in zen  
tradition lot of the masters never expereinced this...so I do not know

In Bhagavan Ramana's case, it was just one dive and He never returned. And  
that is why we call Him as an avatara of Skanda   
and Jnana Sambandha. But in most of our cases, the dive has to be   
done several times. Sometimes a pearl and some other times, a heap of mud and  
stone. Pereseverence and continued patience is the only way. You cannot  
throw away books or pictures or stop Arunachala visits just as you like.  
Perhaps after one year, you will take this back and re-start. Everything  
happens as per destiny. Desiring the Self is the only desire that we can  
have. The rest of them should be left to destiny or Guru.   
Bhagavan Ramana's philosphy is Advaita. He did not say it. Only after  
reading Sankara in Tiruvannamalai, He felt that his experience and Sankara's  
descriptions tallied. In fact, Bhagavan Ramana said   
about Ajata Vada of Gaudapada, Sankara's Guru's Guru. And that is more  
correct. But He never dis-approved dvaita or visishtadvaita. He said all  
paths lead to the royal road of Self enquiry. And that is why He never  
approved change of religion even to Westerners and Muslims and Sindhis. He  
said: "All you fellows, you will one day come to the royal road of self enquiry  
through various sub roads."

My enquiry does not seem to work for me... (Its more out of despair, I know I  
need to work more, but....)   
what to do? what to not do? how to just be? Who am I... I know the immediate  
answer from myself... find out this 'I' and and it will get merged into the  
eternal 'I' but.... its not happening... (maybe I have not enquired enough  
but)   
Why has this sprung... why has there a need to realise been created... if we  
are already that SELF always... I dont understand anything...   
dear nagaraj,   
doubt is very much a part of the search. the journey we have undertaken may  
appear to be difficult at times. the churning is so important so that  
something can emerge out of it. i think we should give value to our doubts  
too.   
the "Tat" of the "tat twam asi" is "tat" so far as we are not realised. There  
may not be any this or that or i or u once we become realised.   
so even when things appear to be confusing/not clear because in our experience  
we dont know what self is apart from what we read here or there or are told  
here and there....the search should continue, isn't it?   
Because THAT / TAT alone matters.......!   
love,   
vinita

I read some lines of augustinus the father of the church..just some moments  
before I read the post of vinita...   
he wrote we should start to doubt everything, step by step, then we will se  
that we can doubt our intellect...that we can even doubt the senses..because  
what we see,hear,taste etc. may ba a hallucination.....but then we will see  
that there must be something that doubts....something that can doubt but  
cannot be the object of out doubts...   
this we cannot doubt is this moment, the arising of what is...and augustinus  
concludes that god lives in this presence.....that this presence that is here  
right now is the way to god...   
what we read up there.... is advaita isnt it?   
neti neti and vichara...the way was always the same...ramana restored it so  
beautifull, so easy, so direct, like no one before him....   
we should thank him for this with all we can give int he present moment

In Sri Ramana Ashottaram, there is one Name: Prostrations to the One who swallowed all the doubts!   
This has become possible for Bhagavan Ramana as soon as He became   
self realized. Whereas, we are all haunted by torturing doubts, because we  
are not yet with the Goal. Sankara uses a word Vipareeta   
Sandheha in Vivekachoodamani. That is, even after the way has been   
taught, the disciple finds Sunya, emptiness, and started doubting the way  
itself! Then the Guru says, "Stay in that Sunya, without any doubts, the  
Effulgence would soon dawn!" I think, this sums up   
the whole matter.

Nagarjuna come to my mind: In order to help prevent people from getting attached to the idea of nirvana,  
the Bodhisattva Nagarjuna stated: Samsara [i.e., the stream of conditioned existence] has nothing that  
distinguishes it from nirvana; nirvana has nothing that distinguishes it from  
samsara. The limit of nirvana is the limit of samsara; there is not even the  
subtlest something separating the two.   
\   
Mere suffering exists, no sufferer is found;   
The deeds are, but no doer of the deeds is there;   
Nirvana is, but not the man that enters it;   
The path is, but no traveller on it is seen

Once Viswanatha Swami's brother came to the Asramam for darshan   
of Bhagavan. He was a freedom fighter and he had just then been in   
prison. Obviously he was against casteism. At lunch, he wanted to   
sit with nonbrahmins! Bhagavan Ramana used to sit in between the brahmin and  
non brahmin rows, at right angles. Even today, there is   
a photograph, where He is sitting before plate leaf. Bhagavan Ramana told  
Viswanatha Swami: "Look! Desiring to sit with non brahmins to show that you  
are against castes, is itself a desire.   
Do not do that. Sit with me if you want!" Viswanatha Swami's brother  
sliently went to sit at brahmin's row. Bhagavan Ramana   
always showed that one should not deliberately desire any opposite   
views, just to prove one's point. Aspring Sannyasa, because Grahastha-ship is  
unmanageable is equally bad as desiring the opposite.

dear subramanyaji,   
without trying to prove a point, desiring freedom thru self enquiry is the  
opposite of living in a state on "ignorance"/non-enquiry.   
to my limited understanding desire is essential to my progress just as it is a  
barrier to my progress.   
desiring to reach a state where i unite with self - self which is always there  
- may seem to be a contradiction.   
the fact is that desire is a motivating force for the unrealised.   
For the realised, of course, there may be no desire / no motivation.   
regards,   
vinita

Dear vinita,   
I was also having the same view as you are now having. There was   
an blog item under Desiring the Self, by David Godman in his blog.   
Several advanced seekers gave their views both ways. I was also   
one of them. Finally David Godman concluded with many many   
quotations from Bhagavan Ramana Himself that Desiring the Self   
is the only desire one seeker can have. He also quoted from   
Annamalai Swami - Final Talks, where Annamalai Swami says this   
as a reply from Bhagavan Ramana for specific questions by seekers   
at that time. He says it is like taking steps towards market. But before  
starting you should have a desire to go to market. Thereafter,   
you do not desire it at every step on the road that you take. Kindly   
see davidgodman.org.   
Arunachala Siva.

Self realized Jnanis do have desires. Bhagavan Ramana says that   
such desires are of routine nature, like being hungry and desiring   
food, or being thirsty and desiring water, nature calls, bathing etc.,   
He may even have some desires outside, like Bhagavan Ramana   
taking additional cups of Malayalam Kanji and aviyal on one occasion.   
These desires do not bear any good or bad effects, nor create further   
desires. These are like 'burnt coir rope'. It has form but no use.

Dear All,   
For doing karma desire is must.   
Without desire no one can do any karma.   
But as bhagavan ramana says   
Small desires such as the desire to eat, drink and sleep and attend to calls  
of nature, though these may also be classed among desires, you can safely  
satisfy. They will not implant vasanas in your mind, necessitating further  
birth. Those activities are just necessary to carry on life and are not likely  
to develop or leave behind vasanas or tendencies. **As a general rule,  
therefore, there is no harm in satisfying a desire where the satisfaction will  
not lead to further desires by creating vasanas in the mind.** (Day by Day  
with Bhagavan, 12th April, 1946)

So there is wrong to have desires. Ok. then when does it become vasana?   
Is it necessary to think when we eat that, to realise who I am, this body is  
necessary so to preserve this body I am eating. Like this, all the necessaries  
to be done is it? They say anything we do repeatedly it forms a habit which  
will come clutch.   
2nd there is one statement.. you do whatever u can but do not have doership.   
Whatever it may be the incompletness within us is driving everyone to find  
out where it can be fullfilled.   
Here in this forum, senior seekers posted actually we are not incomplete. It  
is the mind's play.   
When the mind becomes still there is no problem only the finder will be there.

Dear Nagaraj, I think everything you are going trough is natural. Also,i  
believe,everyone have its own way,path. You shud ajust your practice according  
to your tendencies. You shudnt think that much about realisation,and when it  
will happen. Just believe,have faith,know that your are going in right  
direction,and dont bother when it will finish. Shure,life is hard,and all that  
is easy to say.But like Vivekananda many times said Be brave!Be bold!Be  
strong!Be brave!Be a hero! You will find yourself!Anyway,its our destiny.

Dear Ramanaduli Garu,   
Vasanas is wishing or desiring to do the same action again and again i.e  
creating impressions in our mind which will create further boandage in our  
life.   
As said in Bhagavad Gita Ch3 text13   
Quote  
The devotees of the Lord are released from all kinds of sins because they eat  
food which is offered first for sacrifice. Others, who prepare food for  
personal sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin.  
So while eating we should treat food as prasad of god.   
As Bhagavan ramana says Small desires such as the desire to eat, drink and  
sleep and attend to calls of nature, though these may also be classed among  
desires, you can safely satisfy.

Vasanas accrure by continuing a desire throughout the life and still   
remaining unfulfilled even at the time of death. Suppose you take   
a glass of water and add graphite powder. The powder mixed with   
water would look blackish. After sometime, the graphite powder   
goes to the bottom of the glass and water become clear. You decant   
the water. After clearing the water, you will find the graphite powder   
sticking to the base of the glass, like a thick tar. This is vasanas.

Dear Nagaraj,   
 That perhaps means, you are trying too hard. Relax.   
If needed spend time on something else. May be watch a movie. And then get  
back to it. All in good time, they say.   
I know you understand all this pretty well, but still.   
"Inquiry is not working" \-- what way is it expected to work?   
Yadi Deham Prtak Krithya, Chitti Vishramya tistasi [If you detach yourself  
from body and remain relaxed in Self]   
Adhunaiva sukhi shanto, Bandha mukto bhavishyathi [Immediately you shall be  
Blissful, Peaceful and released from all bondage].   
You are Consciousness -- no where to go, nothing to do. Do not try to  
eliminate something, nor try to make something happen. just continue your  
work. When the urge to "Reach it" is there, in mind. .. one need not obey this  
urge. the urge says "I have to reach", thats a suggestion in mind, not a  
command. we need not obey.   
This is my view.
