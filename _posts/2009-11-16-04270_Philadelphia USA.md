My name is Greg. I've been studying yoga meditation for years. I am very  
interested in having Satsang with Ramana devotees in Melbourne Australia. I  
dont even know if there are any. If you are out there please get in touch with  
me if you wish to have conversations concerning self enquiry (a subject I find  
fascinating). Thank you for your attention. Greg

I live in Spring City Pensylvania, USA. I would like to meet devotees of  
bhagavan in the area.   
Respectfully,
