Is there any duality while attending to the self i.e during self-enquiry?

No no duality whether attending to self inquiry or doing waht ever ;  
duality is a mistaken notion: no matter what one is doing !There is no duality  
right now.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju and srkudai, Attending to the self-enquiry, that is,   
asking, "Who am I?" is also a thought. This one thought, will ward off   
all other thoughts, and eventually, even this will burn itself, like   
the stick that is used to stir the funeral pyre. (Who am I? - 1902)   
Dear srkudai, Nice, but you are telling the 'ultimate'.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, Do not rush to where even the angels fear to go! Even during  
enquiry there is duality. Duality vanishes only when you are   
self realized. Then, there is no Subramanian, no non duel, no Sankar,   
no DRPVSSN Raju, no srkudai. One is One without a Second!

Dear Sankar, There is duality till the self enquiry or self   
surrender merges into the goal, the Self. Then, there is   
selflessness, that is there is no individual self or soul. But,   
it is full of SELF-ishness!

Ramana Maharshi says Duality (dvaita) even during sadhana is not present   
 **Even the argument which says, Duality (dvaita) during practice (sadhana)   
which one undertakes (due to) not knowing (the truth that one is always  
Brahman)  and nonduality (advaita) after attainment (that is, duality is true  
during the time of practice and non-duality becomes true only after the  
attainment of Self-realization), is not true. Who else is one except the  
tenth man, both when one is anxiously searching (for the tenth man) and when  
one finds oneself (to be the tenth man).**   
Sri Bhagavan says that even this is not true, because nonduality (advaita) is  
always the truth and duality (dvaita) is always unreal. That is, the one non-  
dual **Self alone exists and is real** even when in the ignorant outlook of  
the individual it seems to appear as this unreal world of duality and  
diversity.   
In order to emphasis that duality is unreal even during the time of its  
seeming existence, Sri Bhagavan cites the parable of the lost tenth man.  
_Ten foolish men forded a river, and on reaching the other side they wished to  
make sure that all had crossed safely. So all of them began to count the  
number of persons on the shore, but since each one forgot to count himself,  
they all counted only nine. Believing that one of their companions must have  
drowned, they all began to weep, until a passing wayfarer who understood the  
situation asked each one to count himself, whereupon they realized that they  
were always ten men, both during the time of their seeming loss and after  
their finding the missing man. Similarly, when we attain Self-knowledge we  
will realize that non-duality (advaita) is always the sole truth,both during  
the time of our seeming ignorance (when nonduality appears to be lost and  
duality appears to prevail) and after our attaining Self, the non-dual  
reality._   
 **It is to be noted here that, though non-duality is the truth even during  
the time of seeming ignorance, this does not mean that no spiritual practice  
(sadhana) is necessary,as some theoreticians/theorists have wrongly  
concluded.So long as the tenth man appears to be lost, it is necessary for  
each one of the ten to enquire and find out Who is lost?, for then only  
will the truth be realized that the so called lost tenth man is only  
oneself, who has in fact never been lost. Similarly, so long as the experience  
of non-duality appears to be lost, it is necessary for us to enquire and find  
out Who am I, who have lost the experience of non-duality?**, for then only  
will the truth be realized that the seeming individual I who does not  
experience non-duality is merely an unreal appearance, and that the real I  
has in fact never lost the experience of non-duality.

Dear non duel, These are all discussions for the benefit of all.   
But no one is forced to accept one or all of them. Zen koans   
are given by the Master and each one works it out in the way   
it is suitable to them. Bhagavan always went by the way of the   
questioning devotee and then eventually brought him to the   
Self enquiry. He agreed to Gambhiram Seshayyar in Raja Yoga,   
agreed to Krishna Premi in Bhakti Yoga, agreed to Ramanatha   
Brahmachari in Karma Yoga. Ultimately everyone has to   
arrive at Jnana Marga, the Self Enquiry.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju ji   
Unless we attend to the thought how does the action take place. I think it is  
possible for those who attained self realisation. They are immersed within  
themselves. But for an ordinary people like me I think it is necessary to give  
attention to our thought. Thought may be good and bad. So we need budhi to  
justify before puting into action. For an instance I have a thought not to  
watch Tv. instead reading Bhagavan's book. Unless I pay attention I never read  
it. Sometimes we do never have any thing to do like lying on bed with  
sickness. That time we can just watch all the thoughts. It is my view. I may  
be wrong.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 Thought has it's place when action is required even in the case of saints.We should not give place to thoughts in our mind   
which are out of context and not in anyway required and for many it became  
such a strong habit that it is impossible to stop the thought flow.   
A person of the caliber of Sri Ganapathi Sastri who has mantra siddhi could  
not control the thought traffic and missed self-realisation even in the   
close association of Bhagawan.He has strong sastra vasana and loka vasana and  
for many years he is district congress president and he wanted   
whole India to have cement roads because he strongly felt that world is real  
and we should work for it's welfare,though Bhagawan told him   
that waking state is also a dream.Because he gave attention to such thoughts  
he missed the quintessence of Bhagawan's teaching and missed   
the self.To fulfil basic needs we require only few thoughts for action.But we  
are indulging in unnecessary thinking and action,which i feel should   
be curtailed in sadhana stage.This is very vital.Thought traffic is reduced  
when one is in uninterrupted awareness,Sada Apramada as told by   
Sanat kumara.

Dear Sir   
Adding to my previous mail, I want to share something. in the light of Self,  
we know some thing is trigger in the brain cell which becomes thought. If it  
is repeated unknowingly we pay attention. Some thought may come due to our  
previous vasanas. This may be good or bad thought. If we have enough punyam  
and with the grace of Guru we may follow the good thought. Before puting into  
action this thought there comes Sankalpa. I heard many times even God also  
have sankalpa. which we call it Daiva sankalpa. Long time ago I read in Adi  
Sankara's comments. The worm how it has wings and breaking the house of its,  
flies away. because everytime the bee stings the worm, it starts thinking I  
should fly away. So here the thought only puts the worm into higher level.  
Thoughts have tremendous power. I think there is nothing wrong to have  
thoughts but we should have positive thoughts only. Unless we have a guru we  
do not know whether our thoughts and attention is good or not.Every now and  
then we can ask His guidence. Am I right?   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanduli, The one thought, "Who am I?" causes,   
as Raju said, apramada, the cleaning up of all the other thoughts.   
This thought takes one to the merger of the Self and that thought   
also burns up eventually, like the stick that is used in stirring the   
funeral pyre. (Who am I?)

Dear DRPVSSN Raju and srkudai, Thoughts will keep on rising,   
whether one attends to it or not. Bhagavan says: " If you ask,   
for whom is this thought? Then that thought will withdraw   
and another will spring up. Thoughts will keep coming, like   
the soldiers in the fortress and unless you kill all the thoughts,   
the fortress will not come to your hand." (Who am I? - 1902)

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, The interpretation of non duel is correct.   
Just watch the thoughts with the questions, "For whom are these   
thoughts". "It is for me", "Who am I?". Then comes Self-attention.   
Thoughts will keep on rising like soldiers from the enemy fortress.   
Empty the fortress.

Dear nonduel,   
 Thought arises only when there is a seeming movement of attention from the self towards the object.Whatever method you   
follow we should see that attention rests in itself wiout any  
movement.Attention is not thought.It is an awareness independent of thought   
activity.The witnessing nature of awareness is disturbed when there is seeming  
movement of awareness.

Dear nonduel,   
 You can address me just Raju.What you are referring is only objective attention in which there is bound to be duality and in that   
attention never rests in itself,if it really rests in itself there will be no  
nonduel,no objective world,no separate resting attention apart from you   
all will be dissolved in your self-conscious being.At present you are  
deliberately attentive with mind so you are experiencing duality.   
But awareness is independent of duality and you can experience even before  
annihilation of the ego,only thing is that you will not be   
established in awareness permanently when the ego still persists.There is  
temporary cessation of ego when your awareness is not drawn   
towards an object during which time your consciousness is one with the self-  
consciousness in which all duality is dissolved temporarily   
and you can taste nonduality and it's bliss.Kindly dont think all this is just  
theory and i want to convince you to my point of view.

Dear srkudai,when that light of self is directed towards some object,it  
becomes a thought with object knowing consciousness.   
At the present state of our understanding we are more interested in indulging  
in a life of thought rather than positing ourselves in   
the peaceful light of self.It is we who are giving a direction to the light of  
self resulting in apparent limitation of it.   
We must withdraw that attention from the objects through self-enquiry to get  
posited in the pure light of self.   
Thought arises only when we are interested in thought.Because thinking became  
a habit thought is out of our hands now.   
For curing this anomaly self-enquiry is the only way.

Dear non duel and others, I am happy that the Forum is hotting up.   
It is good. Only when butter is heated, one can get the 'clarified'   
butter, the ghee.   
Dear nonduel, You are correct. Everyone is giving his point of view.   
There is no obligation to accept. There could be different paths.   
But all roads are leading to Rome. Ramana's path, I believe, is   
the path suitable to me. That is all.   
Dear Sankar, What does your 'NO' indicate? I am confused.   
Please heat it up to clarify the butter.   
Dear DRPVSSN RAJU and srkudai, Good exchange of ideas.   
But it is for one to take it or not. Is it not?

Dear non duel, These are all discussions for the benefit of all.   
But no one is forced to accept one or all of them. Zen koans   
are given by the Master and each one works it out in the way   
it is suitable to them. Bhagavan always went by the way of the   
questioning devotee and then eventually brought him to the   
Self enquiry. He agreed to Gambhiram Seshayyar in Raja Yoga,   
agreed to Krishna Premi in Bhakti Yoga, agreed to Ramanatha   
Brahmachari in Karma Yoga. Ultimately everyone has to   
arrive at Jnana Marga, the Self Enquiry.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju ji   
Unless we attend to the thought how does the action take place. I think it is  
possible for those who attained self realisation. They are immersed within  
themselves. But for an ordinary people like me I think it is necessary to give  
attention to our thought. Thought may be good and bad. So we need budhi to  
justify before puting into action. For an instance I have a thought not to  
watch Tv. instead reading Bhagavan's book. Unless I pay attention I never read  
it. Sometimes we do never have any thing to do like lying on bed with  
sickness. That time we can just watch all the thoughts. It is my view. I may  
be wrong.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 Thought has it's place when action is required even in the case of saints.We should not give place to thoughts in our mind   
which are out of context and not in anyway required and for many it became  
such a strong habit that it is impossible to stop the thought flow.   
A person of the caliber of Sri Ganapathi Sastri who has mantra siddhi could  
not control the thought traffic and missed self-realisation even in the   
close association of Bhagawan.He has strong sastra vasana and loka vasana and  
for many years he is district congress president and he wanted   
whole India to have cement roads because he strongly felt that world is real  
and we should work for it's welfare,though Bhagawan told him   
that waking state is also a dream.Because he gave attention to such thoughts  
he missed the quintessence of Bhagawan's teaching and missed   
the self.To fulfil basic needs we require only few thoughts for action.But we  
are indulging in unnecessary thinking and action,which i feel should   
be curtailed in sadhana stage.This is very vital.Thought traffic is reduced  
when one is in uninterrupted awareness,Sada Apramada as told by   
Sanat kumara.

Dear Sir   
Adding to my previous mail, I want to share something. in the light of Self,  
we know some thing is trigger in the brain cell which becomes thought. If it  
is repeated unknowingly we pay attention. Some thought may come due to our  
previous vasanas. This may be good or bad thought. If we have enough punyam  
and with the grace of Guru we may follow the good thought. Before puting into  
action this thought there comes Sankalpa. I heard many times even God also  
have sankalpa. which we call it Daiva sankalpa. Long time ago I read in Adi  
Sankara's comments. The worm how it has wings and breaking the house of its,  
flies away. because everytime the bee stings the worm, it starts thinking I  
should fly away. So here the thought only puts the worm into higher level.  
Thoughts have tremendous power. I think there is nothing wrong to have  
thoughts but we should have positive thoughts only. Unless we have a guru we  
do not know whether our thoughts and attention is good or not.Every now and  
then we can ask His guidence. Am I right?   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
 Sada Apramada reduces unwanted thought traffic because it withdraws our attention from the nonself.

Dear Ramanduli, The one thought, "Who am I?" causes,   
as Raju said, apramada, the cleaning up of all the other thoughts.   
This thought takes one to the merger of the Self and that thought   
also burns up eventually, like the stick that is used in stirring the   
funeral pyre. (Who am I?)   
Arunachala Siva.
