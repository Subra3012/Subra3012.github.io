## To be a real guru

There are lots of spiritual gurus in our India. Some may have real taste in  
spiritualism but if they want to be a guru for at least they should aware of  
Bhagavan Ramana. Even though He is a jewel of advaita He never told himself a  
guru or He never accepted any body as a devotee. Why these modern gurus never  
learn from Bhagavan Ramana.   
Ramanaduli

Dear Ramanaduli,   
There are no parallels in recent times for Bhagavan Ramana. He   
never asked anything from anyone. He never takes also anything   
from anyone, unless such offerings could be shared with other devotees  
present. He took persons as they are, no preconditions,   
no pre qualifications. He was available 24 hours of the day. There   
were some devotees, who came late night, and when attendants   
refused permission, He came out and asked the attendants to let   
them in. He never did any materializations, making vibhuti, kumkum   
or gold pendants. When devotees were sincere, He conferred them   
the glimpse of the Self to take further interest and proceed in their   
sadhana. And last but not the least, He never discriminated   
between brahmins and non brahmins. He is very unique and can   
never be compared with anyone in recent times.   
There is a line of poem: As civilization advances, the poetry   
declines. That is in modern days, one cannot get a Kalidasa   
or Shakespeare or Milton or Kamban. The poetry has declined   
And so is the case of 'standards' of gurus. Tirumoolar says that   
one who has not realized the Siva himself, if he wants to direct   
others for liberation, it will be like a blind leading the blind to   
go on a particular path. Both will fall into the pit!   
Arunachala Siva.

BG does not distinguish between man and woman. But it gives equal importance   
to karma, bhakti and jnana whereas Sri Ramana Gita concentrates on Jnana  
Marga.   
Further SRG says that women could also have sannyasam and liberation,  
explicitly.   
Arunachala Siva.

BG does not give equal importance to jnana / bhakti & Karma either.   
thats a wrong notion. .. not supported by Sankara's commentary.   
Bhakti being non-different from Jnana is always supreme !   
karma and Raja yogas are means to purify mind. .. thats all.   
"jnana vihena sarva mathena bajathi na muktim janma sathena", says sankara. ..  
one without jnana will not find liberation in a 100 births no matter which  
religion he belongs to !   
 Sankara never said that all 4 are means to liberation. he maintained always  
taht karma cannot lead to liberation it can only purify mind. same with yoga.   
Bhakti is supreme as it is equivalent to jnana.

Yes udai garu you are right.Bhakti being non-different from Jnana is always  
supreme !   
**Bhagavan Sri Ramana has made it quite clear that people** who have had no  
literary education could also attain the highest knowledge through both the  
ways enumerated above,but people **of an emotional nature will benefit  
themselves more by bhakti and people of a reflective mood will have better  
appeal to jnana.**   
In the case of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, in spite of his not having seen  
even the portals of a school, he was able to attain the highest knowledge  
through bhakti. And in the case of Sri Ramana we have an example of a Self-  
realised soul through jnana, though Ramana had only very little school  
education. Sankara and Ramana come under the latter category of sages and  
hence it was possible for them to attain the highest knowledge while yet very  
young.

Soham Garu,   
why do you worry about women, vaishyas and shudras? As guru ramana says,they  
can take care of themselves.   
As guru ramana says, **The same scriptures which have laid down varnasrama  
dharma have also proclaimed the oneness of all life and abheda buddhi as the  
only reality.** Is it possible for anyone to teach a higher truth than the  
Unity or Oneness of all life? **There is no need for anyone to start reforming  
the country or the nation before reforming himself.**   
 **Each mans first duty is to realise his true nature.** If after doing it,  
he feels like reforming the country or nation, by all means let him take up  
such reform.   
More over as guru ramana says, **There is varnasrama in some form or other in  
every land. The significance is that one should hold on to the single Atman**  
and not swerve therefrom. That is the whole gist of it.   
As ramana maharshi **says such instructions in the bhagavad gita are according  
to the viewpoint of the seeker.**   
When Arjuna said that he would not fight against his own relations and elders,  
in order to kill them and gain the kingdom, Sri Krishna said: Not that these,  
you or I were not before, are not now, nor will be hereafter. None was born,  
none has died, nor will it be so hereafter and so on.   
Later, as he developed the theme and declared that He had given the same  
instruction to the Sun, through him to Ikshvaku, etc. Arjuna raised the doubt: How can that be? You were born a few years ago. They lived ages ago. Then  
Sri Krishna, understanding Arjunas standpoint, said: Yes, there have been  
many incarnations of myself and yourself; I know them all, but you do not).  
**Such statements appear contradictory, but still both are right according to  
the point of view of the questioner. Christ also declared Before Abraham was,  
I am.**   
Question : What is the purpose of such descriptions in religion?   
 **Ramana Maharshi : Only to establish the reality of the Self.**
