## Where is the Clock?  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: December 11, 2012, 04:49:46 PM

In my computer, I was having a picture of the day's Date and a Clock.  
Suddenly, the Clock has disappeared from the desktop.   
When I looked into Gadgets, the Clock was also not there. How to bring back  
the Clock?   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian,   
Click on the Start icon,get to control panel>click on 'appearance and  
personalization'\>click on 'Restore Desktop gadgets installed with  
windows'.This should restore the Clock in the Gadgets list.   
Namaskar.

1\. Start button   
2.Control panel   
3.Appearance and personalzation   
4.task bar and start button   
5.Notification zone   
6.pl verify there is a small tick in the clock column/from here you can add or  
remove the clock   
At last give Appliquer   
The above notifications I did in my French computer.

Dear Ravi,   
I succeeded in restoring the clock. Hey, you are a wizard in computer. Bill  
Gates of this Forum.   
This is the second time, you have helped me.

Subramanian,   
I faced a similiar problem with my calendar a month back.I got to know the  
'procedure' for restoration then.It is pretty elementary.I am no 'wizard' as  
you think!Just a user of the PC.   
Namaskar.
