Dear Jewell,   
Thanks a lot for your kind words. I added a link to my personal blog under my  
forum's name. It's in Russian, but may be you can understand because our  
languges are very close. Anyway, I uploaded some picks and clips from the last  
pilgrimage. And in archives you can also find some Ramakant Maharaj's videos  
in English if you're interested in.   
Yours in the Self,   
Vladimir
