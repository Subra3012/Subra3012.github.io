Dear keshav,   
Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi did not move out of Tiruvannamalai,   
right from His 17th year, i.e. from 1st Sept. 1896 to His last day.   
Each Jnani has a different way of living. Their teachings can be   
almost same, but the pattern of their lives can be different.   
J. Krishnamurty did not meet Bhagavan Ramana.   
Arunachala Siva.**

Dear keshav,   
Girivalam on 21st November 2010, which is a Poornima and Mahadeepam Day, will  
be a tough task. One has to move by   
inches. On a normal day, it will take [13 kms], about 3 to 4   
hours. One has to walk slowly [like a pregnant lady, as Bhagavan   
Ramana said, gazing at the Hill now and then] and this will take   
4 hours.   
Arunachala Siva.**
