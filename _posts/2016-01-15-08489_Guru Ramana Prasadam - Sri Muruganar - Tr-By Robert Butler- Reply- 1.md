195: When I became united with the feet of the Sadguru, my worldly ties were cut  
away through the practice   
of absorption in His abiding Selfhood, with no longer any need to acquire  
empirical knowledge,   
and the lofty knowledge of Sivam ripened within me as the vast Supreme.   
332: The wise declare that the beautiful light of pure Sivam that is free of  
objective traits, is simply   
shining forth of the Reality, that is consciousness. If the base, fraudulent  
and delusional 'I'   
of the defective mind is eliminated, the incorporeal nature of the Self,  
shining as all that is,   
will be revealed.   
93: When the light of His holy feet, that tranquil shore that is so hard to reach,  
wondrously caused   
my heart to blossom, the ghostly dance of the 'I' with its wild antics  
subsided in the state of   
divine silence, an existence, whose glorious nature is impossible to describe.   
79: As the divine experience that is life at the grace-bestowing feet that ruled  
me became ever more   
intense, within my heart final liberation, a vision worthy to behold, granted  
in grace by true knowledge,   
flared up consuming all in the oneness of a single nature, so that the world  
became the supreme   
realty itself.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
