HYDERABAD: A whopping 160,000 people sang in chorus seven keerthanas, or hymns  
in praise of god, of Telugu saint-poet Thallapaka Annamacharya here on Sunday  
evening, and broke a 70-year-old world record.   
A representative of the Guinness Book of World Records announced that the  
previous record is broken at the grand spiritual musical event, organised to  
mark the 601st birth anniversary of Annamacharya.   
"I have great pleasure in announcing that more than 70 years later the record  
has been broken," said Guinness Book representative Raymond Marshal amid  
thunderous applause at the sprawling Parade Grounds in Secunderabad,  
Hyderabad's twin city.   
He also presented the certificate from Guinness Book of World Records to state  
Minister for Finance K. Rosaiah.   
It was on Aug 2, 1937, that 60,000 people sang the national anthem in Germany  
to set the world record.   
The programme, 'Laksha Gala Sankirthanarchana', was organised jointly by  
Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD), the Andhra Pradesh state cultural council  
and Andhra Silicon. The organisers said 160,000 people sang the keerthanas in  
one voice.   
Renowned Carnatic musician M. Balamurali Krishna, singer Kavitha Krishnamurthy  
and her husband L. Subramanyam and Garimella Balakrishna Prasad led 160,000  
singers, both professionals and amateurs. Telugu actor Nagarjuna, who acted in  
film "Annamayya", was also present.   
Annamacharya, who was born in 1408, composed 32,000 Sankeerthans eulogising  
Lord Venkateswara. The TTD, which manages the affairs of the Lord  
Venkateshwara temple at Tirumala, is organising Annamacharya's 601st birth  
anniversary celebrations on a grand scale.   
TTD chairman D.K. Audikesavulu Naidu announced that Tallapaka, the birthplace  
of Annamacharya in Kadapa district, will be developed as a major spiritual  
centre.   
The TTD is also making efforts to propagate Keerthanas of the first Telugu  
lyric poet worldwide by organising spiritual programmes, including group  
rendering of Sankeerthans and lectures on his literary works.

The true saints like Annamaya & Kabir are the social reformers. They were  
brahma jnani.s. Annamaya's BRAHMAM OKATE song is teaching brahma jnan. In  
purana it says Vishnu is the protecter. And in Gita He says DHARMA SAMARTH....  
SAMBUVAMI YUGE YUGE. So whenever the society goes in wrong direction, He sends  
some Bhaktas like Annamaya, kabir, chaitanya, nayarmars and azhvars. We cannot  
see anyother country like India where so many saints were born. We are blessed  
to take birth in India. Especially when you go to Thruvannamalai for girivalam  
we can feel. It gives great feeling to walk the mountain path where Bhagavan  
also walked. Whenever I go back to India from Us. after seeing the garbage on  
roads I say to my friends MERA BHARAT MAHAN HAI.

well said ramanaduli garu.   
India is a sacred land which is unique in everything.   
Me and my wife were singing devotional songs when we had done girivalam in Dec  
2009.
