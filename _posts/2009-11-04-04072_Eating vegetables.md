## Eating vegetables

Often the objection is raised that we are killing plants to eat them. But this  
is not accurate, either. When we harvest vegetables, we do so at the end of  
their growth cycle; we dont cut them down in the prime of life. Animals,  
however, are slaughtered long before their natural lifespan is finished. We  
must also distinguish between the fruit and the plant. When we pick, say a  
tomato, we do not kill the plant, but it continues to growno life is taken.  
As for root vegetables such as carrots or potatoes, the root that we harvest  
is the final stage in the plants growth; if it were not harvested, the plant  
would merely rot in the earth. Furthermore, in plants the sensory mind is only  
potential, it is asleep. They do not feel pain. Although they do have a  
rudimentary nervous system that responds to injury, the conscious mind that  
would receive the message of pain in animal organisms is not functional.   
from "The Four Soul Killers"

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent. Bhagavan Ramana used to say that we should not   
pluck flowers from the trees, but only pick them when they   
fall on the ground. Once one lady plucked bhilwa leaves,   
left and right on the Hill, while coming with Bhagavan Ramana,   
for a stroll. Bhagavan Ramana said: Do not pluck these leaves   
and tonsure the trees. Pick them when they fall on the ground.   
The lady replied: "Bhagavan Ramana! I have got a penance to   
do archana to Siva with 100 thousand leaves." Bhagavan Ramana   
said: O Siva wants 100 thousand bhilwa leaves! You pinch your   
body 100 thousand times instead!" It really pinches oneself   
to listen to such golden words! Once when bugs were in the   
sofa, Bhagavan Ramana simply allowed them to bite Him and   
suck His blood. When He was away for a stroll, some attendant   
applied some DDT to kill the bugs. He came back and found the   
mischief by the smell. "So someone had played the trick.."   
He said.   
Arunachala Siva.

As for root vegetables, you cut the root you kill the plant. Carrots reproduce  
by forming a seedhead which comes up from the center of the carrot. Carrots  
are biennial - that means they take two years to reach maturity when they can  
produce seeds.   
The carrots one eat are harvested before the 3rd month after the seed has been  
planted.

And for the fruits with seeds, unless you eat the fruit and plant the seeds  
you are cutting off on reproduction. Animals eat the ripped fruits and then  
release the seeds with the feces.   
So fruits would be ok if you take the time to spread the seeds.

What is "wrong" with killing plants to eat them? Would it be better to eat  
them alive or worse to boil them first?   
If apples scream when we bite into them -- is that bad and if so, is it more  
bad than biting a dead chicken (leave aside the horrible treatment if poultry  
before it lies, packaged in a protected atmosphere and garanteed samonella  
free, on sale...)   
I saw a documentary about some people who live way, way up north. Their diet  
is mostly, fish, seal, walrus and whale. I saw them kill a big bull walrus,  
drag it ashore and, before starting to cut it up (this must be done quickly as  
the meat becomes inedible after a few hours if not partitioned) the leader of  
the hunters knelt and said in prayer something like, "Forgive us grandfather  
walrus, but our wives and children must have food to eat or they will die".   
I figure that it is the attitude towards and treatment of food objects that is  
important, not very much what is eaten.

I don't know what's wrong with it.   
Just trying to clarify that those postulates about convincing oneself that is  
a better human being because of eating vegetables has no real foundations, and  
they are not accurate.   
Now, about how different diets affect the mind is another story.

Dear friend,   
In fact, Bhagavan Ramana's comment was restricted only to the   
fact that vegetarian food brings about more sattvic qualities in   
a person. He also mentioned vegetarian food in moderate quantities, vide Who  
am I? The Westerners switched over to   
vegetarian food on their own. No one compelled them.   
Arunachala Siva.

Hello Subramanian,   
Thank you.   
Actually I was commenting on the first post, where I believe, the information  
given is not accurate. It sounds more like our bodies are doing a favor to the  
Plants eating them because they are at the final growth cycle. Actually I  
thinks, except for fruits and leaves, most of the vegetables we eat they don't  
even reach half of their growth cycle, or for example seeds and beans, are  
embryos + its food + protective coat, eating them would mean killing an  
embryo. So if you feed your body with animals, or vegetables, either way you  
technically need to get it killed. Maybe except for riped fruits, leaves, and  
any other vegetables that don't need to be killed to obtain a food source.   
As for vegetables, I doesn't know if they feel pain, but if they respond to  
stimuli like light, they can easily feel something, maybe not pain as we feel  
it, but some sort of Life-threatening reaction.   
I am Vegetarian now, but before I used to eat everything, then meat was making  
me feel bad in the stomach, like bloated, so the body was rejecting meat. With  
fish and shellfish, happens kind of the same, I started reacting even more and  
worse to histamine each time. So I ended up with vegetables, not all of them.   
I believe if you are going to be thinking if your food source comes from a  
killing, as an assessination, you are left with almost no food source. But if  
you get to know that your body is taking something from nature to later give  
it back, as a part of a bigger life cycle which involves every living being,  
your body will be given back to nature as food source for some vegetables  
maybe, which I don't think will be dealing with this mental ordeal of food  
procedence.   
I believe each one of our bodies is feeding on what is supposed to be feeding  
right now. If needs to change its diet it will.

Dear m0j0,   
I appreciate your views. If you read old Tamil and Sanskrit   
scriptures, you will find that Sages were eating only air and   
water, they call it Vayu bakshanam and Jala bakshanam. This   
is impossible. Then, they have mentioned that one can eat   
dry fallen leaves of trees and fruits that had fallen on their own   
on the ground. But practically speaking even Sages have to live   
and they have to eat something. Hence they prescribed the plant   
and fruits, which at best, one may say, are in the lowest cycle of   
beings. The animals, birds and fish are on the higher rung of the   
evolution ladder. And the first two 'express' the pain while being killed.  
Hence this was forbidden. Advaita in fact, never speaks on this subject.  
Only Saiva Siddhantam, which came into practice sometime from 300 AD,  
prescribed this because Siva is grace embodiment.   
"Saivam" in Tamil means Vegetarian apart from the Siva doctrine.   
We can, if we want, prescribe a level as it suits one. It is   
only to improve the Sattvic qualities, that shall aid Atma Vichara.   
(Who am I?)   
Jainism and Buddhism prescribed vegetarianism as the code of   
conduct. But practically today, they have fallen way behind eating   
all sorts of non vegetarian items, like pigs, snakes, sharks and whales and  
frogs!   
Arunachala Siva.

All that apart. .. our natural usage is   
if someone cuts a plant, its normal.   
if someone cuts a human as easily as he cuts the plant, its cruel.   
The more comfortable a person is in killing higher forms of life, the more  
cruel he is... thats how we use the words.   
Its relative world we are speaking about. .. so the nomenclature explains it.  
when a person is pure, he would like to cause as little suffering as possible  
to the world. .. and so he would prefer to eat purely vegetarian food.   
Exceptions like Nissargadatta & Vivekananda, Ramakrishna apart [we cannot  
discuss about Jnani's on the basis of their actions], its nice to be a  
vegetarian and have a compassionate heart!   
Love!

Once Bhagavan Ramana's sofa was full of bed bugs. These   
creatures were sucking the blood at their will. The attendants   
told this Bhagavan Ramana and He replied: Oh! do not bother,   
they will go away on their own, once they are bored with my blood.   
Next evening, when Bhagavan Ramana left for a stroll on the Hill,   
the attendants applied DDT (which had just then been invented)   
and cleared up the sofa. Bhagavan Ramana on return could find   
out the mischief with the smell. He said: "Oh, someone had played   
a trick on me." He left the matter at that.
