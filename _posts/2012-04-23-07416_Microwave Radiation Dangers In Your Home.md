Magda Havas demonstrates how WiFi connects your laptop, iPhone and iPad to the  
internet via microwave radiation. You will also learn how WiFi base stations,  
portable phones and baby monitors constantly radiate microwave radiation. The  
Swiss Government feels that all of these devices have the potential to do  
great harm if used incorrectly and warn their citizens.

I was discussing with my friend, about these huge Telephone towers found in  
many residential areas. It is no secret these days how harmful there towers  
are. My friend told me that in India they use primitive technolody that  
radiates high radiations and are extremely dangerous for everyone, and even  
more specifically for pregnant woman and babies. I asked, if it is so  
dangerous why is the government allowing these things on? he said, the  
companies have invested huge monies in all these towers and unless they are  
able to recover their costs, they are only going to hold us on ransom. For the  
companies, money is important than the people. For the government, their power  
is important than people.   
I guess, cigarate smoking is much better than these radiations (just kidding)  
some time back the media had some reports regarding these towers, but there  
was no response, and, thereafter, the media themselves forgot about all these.  
There are more interested in sensationalism than real welfare.   
This is what i observe, that the world has changed ridiculously even from what  
it was around Bhagavan's time.   
We are living in dangerous times. Where just meditation is not enough. These  
radiations definitely interfere with our mental energies.   
Can we do anything?   
Salutations to Bhagavan

phones" truly demonstrates the dangers

Dear Nagaraj,   
Microwave ovens   
Cell phones   
Cell phone towers in the fields   
Hair Dryers   
All the above cause diseases and damages to organs and even hair loss.

Dear Graham,   
Once you wrote that people coming to T'malai and stay for a good number of  
days lose hair fast, because the emission of   
signals by Cellphone towers. I was a victim of it when I stayed there for 7  
days in 2010.

Subramaniam Sir   
My last visit to Arunachala and Ramana Ashram was in Dec 2009 and after that I  
have stopped visiting there. I have been very frequent visitor to Arunachala  
right from 1999 and after 2007 or so onwards I saw severe deterioration of  
many things there to such an extent that after Dec 2009 I decided that I will  
invoke Bhagwan /Arunachala from my home itself and started Moving to Rishikesh  
for deepening my Spiritual Sadhana in solitude. The infrastructure in  
Thiruvanamalai is unable to cope up with the severe rush of devotees and the  
place has become highly overcrowded with lots of constructions, excessive  
vehicles and vehicular pollution, shops, the hotel facilities are substandard  
, outside food is also getting horrible, and now with extreme power cuts ( I  
hear it is more than 10 hrs ) , and added to that now too many chaps putting  
posters promising to "awaken others " through their satsangs. Rishikesh is  
also having the same symptoms but at least due to Ganges flowing one half of  
Rishikesh is cut off from Heavy Vehicles like Cars, Trucks etc and I am  
fortunate to settle in the safe side of Ganges that has only human rush but  
not Vehicular pollution. The Cell Phone Tower pollution is not much seen as I  
still found sparrows moving. I was thrilled to see sparrows there after a long  
time. They are now absent in Chennai.   
No doubt Bhagwan's Samadhi Shrine and Old Hall are very powerful and are least  
affected by the happenings outside, but I feel unless one gets the blessings  
of staying in the ashram inside, the outside challenges are too much to face  
.At least I felt that way as the Arunachala I saw in 1999 is not the same what  
I saw in 2009.   
So I am now comfortable following Bhagwan's teachings at my home itself  
-listening to the Tamil Parayana, reading his works and sharing in this forum  
.   
Om Peace.
