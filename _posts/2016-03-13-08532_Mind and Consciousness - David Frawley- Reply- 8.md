From Mind to Consciousness: We must learn to move beyond the mind to pure Consciousness, which is to  
return to our true nature,   
our inner Being. It is to rest in the silence and peace within that no  
thought, opinion, belief or conclusion   
can touch. It is to enter into the realm of Being and direct experience,  
where no words can go, which leaves   
no outer trace, where one becomes everything and nothing.   
The mind is an excellent tool and instrument for consciousness. It has a  
wonderful capacity for action, expression, memory and coordination of our  
outer actions. But if we try to understand consciousness through   
the mind, we fall into spiritual ignorance and confusion. We wrongly identify  
our true Self and Being with   
our outer being. However, if we abide in pure consciousness, then the mind  
has in its place to help us to   
function in life. But the mind no longer throws its tendencies and impulses  
upon as our real motivation.   
Learn to discriminate between mind and consciousness. Learn to witness the  
mind. Dwell as the seer of the   
mind and its modifications. This is the Yoga of meditation that empties the  
mind of its conditioning and allows   
us to rest in our true nature, to see Reality, and to go beyond death.   
concluded.   
Arunachala Siva.
