**Ramakrishna (smiling): Well, I went to some places. Hazra went farther and  
higher up, to Hrishikesha in the Himalayas. I did not go so far or so high up.   
The vulture and the kite soar very high, but their eyes are all the while  
directed to the charnel-pits below. Do you know what the charnel-pits are?  
Lust and gold. If in going on a pilgrimage a man does not acquire Bhakti, then  
his pilgrimage is fruitless; for Bhakti is the end of all; it is the one thing  
needful.   
Do you know what the vulture and the kite are? They are those who talk on  
lofty subjects and say: "We have performed most of the works enjoined in the  
Holy Scriptures," but whose minds are immersed in worldliness and strongly  
attached to wealth, name, fame, and sense-pleasures.**   
Pandit: Yes, Revered Sir,that is true. Going on a pilgrimage is like casting  
aside the precious stone worn on the breast of Vishnu and wandering about in  
search of other jewels.   
Ramakrishna: Again, you should know that although you may give thousands of  
instructions, still they will not produce results until the time is ripe.   
**A child before going to sleep says to its mother: "Mamma dear, awaken me  
when I shall feel hungry."   
The mother replies: "Do not worry about that, my child; thy hunger will awaken  
thee."  
**In the same manner one yearns after God when the proper time comes for it.

When someone offered Bhagavan to take Him in a special train   
all through India, He said: "Where can I go? What can I see?   
At least here, I am staying permanently and people know me   
that I am available here. If I go out, they will be disappointed."   
Oor chutru uLam vidathu unai kandu adangida   
un azhagai kattu arunachala - Sri AAMM. Verse 8   
Reveal your true beauty, O Arunachala, so that this mind   
is prevented from wandering in the streets and towns and is   
stilled by your Presence.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear grhluna,   
Saint Manikkavachagar says in Tiruvachakam: In this world which is itself unstable, how can we live stably?   
We shall go to Sivapuram (Kailash or the state of liberation).   
The golden doors are open and let us rush towards there.   
Let us go and abide at his anklet-wearing golden feet;   
If you hesitate and stay back*, he will become rare to get!   
(* staying back and hesitation means: "Let me tell my wife   
and come or let me have a coffee and then join you." This   
hesitation will put you back without going to Sivapuram.)   
Arunachala Siva.
