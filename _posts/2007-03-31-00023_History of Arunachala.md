There is a section called 'Arunachala saints' on David Godman's website  
(www.davidgodman.org). There are articles there on Guhai Namasivaya, Guru  
Namasivaya, Arunagirinatha and Isanya Jnana Desikar, all of who were  
Tiruvannamalai saints who lived several centuries ago. There is also a one-  
chapter extract from Arunachala Puranam, the sthala puranam that chronicles  
the various legends of Arunachala. Elsewhere on the site there is an article  
entitled 'Bhagavan's Deposition on Arunachala' which gives a selection of  
puranic verses about the greatness of Arunachala, all of which were picked by  
Bhagavan himself.   
 In addition to biographies of the saints, there are extracts from their writings, mostly translated by Robert Butler. Some of these poems have not been published anywhere else.

Dear vic, if you know Tamil, you may read Arunachala Puranam,   
a book of Tamil poems (649 poems) by Saiva Ellappa Navalar,   
with a prose translation by Shanmuga Arunachalam. It has been   
published by Ramanasramam. The book deals with Shiva's marriage,   
later misunderstanding (! ), Sakti's tapas, Her winning back Shiva's   
left side (Concorporate Shiva-Sakti), the story of Vajarangatha Pandya,   
and Vallala Maharaja (the King who protected Arunagirinatha.   
The benefits of going round the Hill, the tanks and waters in the Hill   
and Annamalai Venba have been given as appendices.
