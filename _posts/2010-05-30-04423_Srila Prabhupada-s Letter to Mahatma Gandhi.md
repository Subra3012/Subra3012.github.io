1947: July 12   
Cawnpore   
Mahatma Gandhijee   
Bhangi Colony   
New Delhi.   
Dear Friend Mahatmajee,   
Please accept my respectful Namaskar. I am your unknown friend but I had to  
write to you at times and again although you never cared to reply them. I sent  
you my papers Back to Godhead but your secretaries told me that you have  
very little time to read the letters and much less for reading the magazines.  
I asked for an interview with you but your busy secretaries never cared to  
reply this.   
Anyway as I am your very old friend although unknown to you I am again writing  
to you in order to bring you to the rightful position deserved by you. As a  
sincere friend I must not deviate from my duty towards a friend like your good  
self.   
 **I tell you as a sincere friend that you must immediately retire from active  
politics if you do not desire to die an inglorious death. You have 125 years  
to live as you have desired to live but you if you die an inglorious death it  
is no worth. The honour and prestige that you have obtained during the course  
of you present life time, were not possible to be obtained by any one else  
within the living memory. But you must know that all these honours and  
prestiges were false in as much as they were created by the Illusory Energy of  
Godhead called the maya.**   
By this falsity I do not mean to say that your so many friends were false to  
you nor you were false to them. By this falsity I mean illusion or in other  
words the false friendship and honours obtained thereby were but creation of  
maya and therefore they are always temporary or false as you may call it. But  
none of you neither your friends nor yourself knew this truth.   
Now by the Grace of God that illusion is going to be cleared and thus your  
faithful friends like Acarya Kripalini and others are accusing you for your  
inability at the present moment to give them any practical programme of work  
as you happened to give them during your glorious days of non-co-operation  
movement. So you are also in a plight to find out a proper solution for the  
present political tangle created by your opponents.   
You should therefore take a note of warning from your insignificant friend  
like me, that unless you retire timely from politics and engage yourself cent  
per cent in the preaching work of Bhagavad-gita, which is the real function of  
the Mahatmas, you shall have to meet with such inglorious deaths as Mussolini,  
Hitlers, Tojo, Churchill or Lloyd Georges met with.   
You can very easily understand as to how some of your political enemies in the  
garb of friends (both Indian and English) have deliberately cheated you and  
have broken your heart by doing the same mischief for which you have struggled  
so hard for so many years. You wanted chiefly Hindu-Moslem unity in India and  
they have tactfully managed to undo your work, by creation of the Pakistan and  
India separately. You wanted freedom for India but they have given permanent  
dependence of India.   
You wanted to do something for the upliftment of the position of the bhangis  
but they are still rotting as bhangis even though you are living in the bhangi  
colony. They are all therefore illusions and when these things will be  
presented to you as they are, you must consider them as God-sent. God has  
favored you by dissipating the illusion you were hovering in, and by the same  
illusion you were, nursing those ideas as Truth.   
You must know that you are in the relative world which is called by the sages  
as Dvaita i.e. dual- and nothing is absolute here. Your Ahimsa is always  
followed by Himsa as the light is followed by darkness or the father is  
followed by the son. Nothing is absolute truth in this dual world. You did not  
know this neither you ever cared to know this from the right sources and  
therefore all your attempts to create unity were followed by disunity and  
Ahimsa. Ahimsa was followed by Himsa.   
But it is better late than never. You must know now something about the  
Absolute Truth. The Truth with which you have been experimenting so long is  
relative. The relative truths are creations of the daivi maya qualified by the  
three modes of Nature. They are all insurmountable as is explained in the  
Bhagavad-gita (7.14). The Absolute Truth is the Absolute Godhead.   
In the Katha Upanisad it is ordered that one must approach the bona fide Guru  
who is not only well versed in all the scriptures of the world but is also the  
realised soul in Brahman the Absolutein order to learn the science of  
Absolute Truth. So also it is instructed in the Bhagavad-gita as follows:   
tad viddhi pranipatena   
pariprasnena sevaya   
upadeksyanti tad jnanam   
jnaninas tattvadarsinah   
(4.34)   
But I know that you never underwent such transcendental training except some  
severe penances which you invented for your purpose as you have invented so  
many things in the course of experimenting with the relative truths. You might  
have easily avoided them if you had approached the Guru as abovementioned. But  
your sincere efforts to attain some Godly qualities by austerities etc surely  
have raised you to some higher position which you can better utilize for the  
purpose of the Absolute Truth. If you, however, remain satisfied with such  
temporary position only and do not try to know the Absolute Truth, then surely  
you are to fall down from the artificially exalted position under the laws of  
Nature.   
But if you really want to approach the Absolute Truth and want to do some real  
good to the people in general all over the world, which shall include your  
ideas of unity, peace and non-violence, then you must give up the rotten  
politics immediately and rise up for the preaching work of the philosophy and  
religion of Bhagavad-gita without offering unnecessary and dogmatic  
interpretations on them. I had occasionally discussed this subject in my paper  
Back to Godhead and a leaf from the same is enclosed herewith for your  
reference. I would only request you to retire from politics at least for a  
month only and let us have discussion on the Bhagavad-gita. I am sure,thereby,  
that you shall get a new light from the result of such discussions not only  
for your benefit but for the benefit of the world at largeas I know that you  
are sincere, honest and moralist.   
Awaiting your early reply with interest.   
Yours sincerely,   
Abhay Charan De.

It was Ghandhi's prarabtha karma where he could not listen Srila Prabhupada's  
words. And also his karma did not allow to have Darshan of Ramana due to  
Rajagopalachari when Ghandhi was in Thruvannamalai. Though Ghandhi wanted to  
see Bhagavan, Rajagopalachari did not take him there. Rajagopalachari knew  
once Ghandhi would see Bhagavan there would be a change in Ghandhi's life.  
Ghandhi would have retired from politics and India would not get independence.  
Ghandhi was a karma yogi otherwise how could utter Hey Ram when he was leaving  
his body.   
Any it is all Maya. Maya will take care of Maya.

Ramanaduli garu,   
Gopal Godse who is brother of Nathuram Godse in an interview in time magazine  
denies that gandhiji has uttered "Hey Ram" when he was leaving his body.   
http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/2000/0214/india.godse.html   
Quote  
TIME: You mean that he did not say "Hey Ram" as he died?   
Godse: No, he did not say it. You see, it was an automatic pistol. It had a  
magazine for nine bullets but there were actually seven at that time. And once  
you pull the trigger, within a second, all the seven bullets had passed. When  
these bullets pass through crucial points like the heart, consciousness is  
finished. You have no strength.  
Anyhow happened is happened and we don't know complete truths and now any ways  
it is history.

Where was Gopal Godse that time. It was shown in the movie lots of congress  
people and Gandhi's follower presented there. Gandhi was doing meditation and  
Rama japa every day so it should be happened at the time of his death he might  
have uttered Ram. People have believe that at the time of death if you say  
some holi name you may go to heaven for that sake people say Ram Ram or Radhe  
Krishna.

Dear prasanth, Ramanaduli,   
I have no specific observations about Prabhupada's letter. However,   
as Ramanaduli observed some people are born for karmas and they   
cannot get away from that since destiny demanded that way. In   
fact, for Gandhi not meeting Bhagavan Ramana due to C.R's intervention about  
lack of time, Dr. Raju had once observed: "Perhaps C.R. was afraid that if  
Gandhi had been allowed to sit with Bhagavan Ramana, he would continue to sit  
there all the time, in Sri Ramanasramam, leaving all the work that he had  
been undertaking, so that he would pursue self enquiry!   
Regarding Gandhi shouting "Hey Ram", while dying, it is true beyond   
doubt. Once Gandhi met Kanchi Mahaswami (Chandrasekara Saraswati) and they  
were closeted for a long time. C.R. as usual   
was waiting impatiently outside. C.R. asked later Gandhi about the 'talk' and  
Gandhi refused to reveal.   
After Gandhi's death, after several years, Kanchi Mahaswami told   
a devotee about this. Gandhi had asked Chandrasekara Saraswati: "Swami! I want a death saying god's name! Please grace me." Kanchi Mahaswami  
had told him, "Thy wish will be done by god's grace. Do not worry!"   
Arunachala Siva.
