## Sri Arunachala Stuti Panchakam and Bhagavan's other original verses  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: November 04, 2009, 08:19:46 AM  
---  
For people who cannot read and understand Tamil, there are   
a number of translations of these works, in English and other   
European languages too. Regarding some of these works, there   
are Sanskrit versions. (Sri Arunachala Pancharatnam - Sanskrit   
original is Bhagavan's). For Upadesa Undiyar, there are again   
Sanskrt versions. Telugu and Malayalam versions done by   
Bhagavan Ramana or others too are available.   
In this connection, Smt. T.R. Kanakammal, has brought out   
her own commentary in Tamil, of all these works about 3-4   
years back. Kanakammal has learnt these verses with elaborate   
meanings directly from Muruganar. One can understand her   
capacity with this. Now, the above verses have been translated   
and commented by Smt. T.R. Kanakammal herself in English   
and this is being published by Sri Ramanasramam. Those   
who are interested in direct, simple commentaries in English   
may kindly order this book from Sri Ramanasramam. The   
price is Rs 150 plus courier charges.   
Arunachala Siva.

## The date of Death Experience of Bhagavan in Madurai  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: November 04, 2009, 08:27:55 AM  
---  
Bhagavan Ramana has described His death experience in   
Madurai, to various devotees at different points of time.   
He had said that it lasted, say for about 15 minutes, and   
it had happened about 6 weeks before leaving for Tiruvannamalai.   
Nowhere there are records about His actual date of death experience.   
Smt Gayatri Dev Vasudev, the illustrious daughter of Dr. (late)   
B.V. Raman, an ardent devotee of Bhagavan Ramana and a   
class astrologer on the lines of her father, has worked out   
details about Bhagavan Ramana's date of death experience.   
Taking His birth chart and also the 6 weeks quoted by Him   
in various conversations, she has shortlisted the period between   
10th July 1896 and 25th July 1896. And she has finally arrived   
at the exact date (as per astrology) of death experience of   
Bhagavan Ramana. No further details. Kindly buy and see   
the Mountain Path isssue, October-December 2009.   
Do not immediately ask: What is the use of such researches?   
There is no answer. Such human curiosity only made David   
Godman work for years with Ramana literature in the Archives   
of Tiruvannamalai. In fact, no one would have known the detailed   
villainy of Perumal Swamy, until David researched it for us.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Eating vegetables  
Author: silentgreen         Date: November 04, 2009, 11:52:28 AM

Often the objection is raised that we are killing plants to eat them. But this  
is not accurate, either. When we harvest vegetables, we do so at the end of  
their growth cycle; we dont cut them down in the prime of life. Animals,  
however, are slaughtered long before their natural lifespan is finished. We  
must also distinguish between the fruit and the plant. When we pick, say a  
tomato, we do not kill the plant, but it continues to growno life is taken.  
As for root vegetables such as carrots or potatoes, the root that we harvest  
is the final stage in the plants growth; if it were not harvested, the plant  
would merely rot in the earth. Furthermore, in plants the sensory mind is only  
potential, it is asleep. They do not feel pain. Although they do have a  
rudimentary nervous system that responds to injury, the conscious mind that  
would receive the message of pain in animal organisms is not functional.   
from "The Four Soul Killers"

Dear silentgreen,   
Excellent. Bhagavan Ramana used to say that we should not   
pluck flowers from the trees, but only pick them when they   
fall on the ground. Once one lady plucked bhilwa leaves,   
left and right on the Hill, while coming with Bhagavan Ramana,   
for a stroll. Bhagavan Ramana said: Do not pluck these leaves   
and tonsure the trees. Pick them when they fall on the ground.   
The lady replied: "Bhagavan Ramana! I have got a penance to   
do archana to Siva with 100 thousand leaves." Bhagavan Ramana   
said: O Siva wants 100 thousand bhilwa leaves! You pinch your   
body 100 thousand times instead!" It really pinches oneself   
to listen to such golden words! Once when bugs were in the   
sofa, Bhagavan Ramana simply allowed them to bite Him and   
suck His blood. When He was away for a stroll, some attendant   
applied some DDT to kill the bugs. He came back and found the   
mischief by the smell. "So someone had played the trick.."   
He said.   
Arunachala Siva.

As for root vegetables, you cut the root you kill the plant. Carrots reproduce  
by forming a seedhead which comes up from the center of the carrot. Carrots  
are biennial - that means they take two years to reach maturity when they can  
produce seeds.   
The carrots one eat are harvested before the 3rd month after the seed has been  
planted.

And for the fruits with seeds, unless you eat the fruit and plant the seeds  
you are cutting off on reproduction. Animals eat the ripped fruits and then  
release the seeds with the feces.   
So fruits would be ok if you take the time to spread the seeds.

What is "wrong" with killing plants to eat them? Would it be better to eat  
them alive or worse to boil them first?   
If apples scream when we bite into them -- is that bad and if so, is it more  
bad than biting a dead chicken (leave aside the horrible treatment if poultry  
before it lies, packaged in a protected atmosphere and garanteed samonella  
free, on sale...)   
I saw a documentary about some people who live way, way up north. Their diet  
is mostly, fish, seal, walrus and whale. I saw them kill a big bull walrus,  
drag it ashore and, before starting to cut it up (this must be done quickly as  
the meat becomes inedible after a few hours if not partitioned) the leader of  
the hunters knelt and said in prayer something like, "Forgive us grandfather  
walrus, but our wives and children must have food to eat or they will die".   
I figure that it is the attitude towards and treatment of food objects that is  
important, not very much what is eaten.

I don't know what's wrong with it.   
Just trying to clarify that those postulates about convincing oneself that is  
a better human being because of eating vegetables has no real foundations, and  
they are not accurate.   
Now, about how different diets affect the mind is another story.

Dear friend,   
In fact, Bhagavan Ramana's comment was restricted only to the   
fact that vegetarian food brings about more sattvic qualities in   
a person. He also mentioned vegetarian food in moderate quantities, vide Who  
am I? The Westerners switched over to   
vegetarian food on their own. No one compelled them.

Hello Subramanian,   
Thank you.   
Actually I was commenting on the first post, where I believe, the information  
given is not accurate. It sounds more like our bodies are doing a favor to the  
Plants eating them because they are at the final growth cycle. Actually I  
thinks, except for fruits and leaves, most of the vegetables we eat they don't  
even reach half of their growth cycle, or for example seeds and beans, are  
embryos + its food + protective coat, eating them would mean killing an  
embryo. So if you feed your body with animals, or vegetables, either way you  
technically need to get it killed. Maybe except for riped fruits, leaves, and  
any other vegetables that don't need to be killed to obtain a food source.   
As for vegetables, I doesn't know if they feel pain, but if they respond to  
stimuli like light, they can easily feel something, maybe not pain as we feel  
it, but some sort of Life-threatening reaction.   
I am Vegetarian now, but before I used to eat everything, then meat was making  
me feel bad in the stomach, like bloated, so the body was rejecting meat. With  
fish and shellfish, happens kind of the same, I started reacting even more and  
worse to histamine each time. So I ended up with vegetables, not all of them.   
I believe if you are going to be thinking if your food source comes from a  
killing, as an assessination, you are left with almost no food source. But if  
you get to know that your body is taking something from nature to later give  
it back, as a part of a bigger life cycle which involves every living being,  
your body will be given back to nature as food source for some vegetables  
maybe, which I don't think will be dealing with this mental ordeal of food  
procedence.   
I believe each one of our bodies is feeding on what is supposed to be feeding  
right now. If needs to change its diet it will.

Dear m0j0,   
I appreciate your views. If you read old Tamil and Sanskrit   
scriptures, you will find that Sages were eating only air and   
water, they call it Vayu bakshanam and Jala bakshanam. This   
is impossible. Then, they have mentioned that one can eat   
dry fallen leaves of trees and fruits that had fallen on their own   
on the ground. But practically speaking even Sages have to live   
and they have to eat something. Hence they prescribed the plant   
and fruits, which at best, one may say, are in the lowest cycle of   
beings. The animals, birds and fish are on the higher rung of the   
evolution ladder. And the first two 'express' the pain while being killed.  
Hence this was forbidden. Advaita in fact, never speaks on this subject.  
Only Saiva Siddhantam, which came into practice sometime from 300 AD,  
prescribed this because Siva is grace embodiment.   
"Saivam" in Tamil means Vegetarian apart from the Siva doctrine.   
We can, if we want, prescribe a level as it suits one. It is   
only to improve the Sattvic qualities, that shall aid Atma Vichara.   
(Who am I?)   
Jainism and Buddhism prescribed vegetarianism as the code of   
conduct. But practically today, they have fallen way behind eating   
all sorts of non vegetarian items, like pigs, snakes, sharks and whales and  
frogs!   
Arunachala Siva.

All that apart. .. our natural usage is   
if someone cuts a plant, its normal.   
if someone cuts a human as easily as he cuts the plant, its cruel.   
The more comfortable a person is in killing higher forms of life, the more  
cruel he is... thats how we use the words.   
Its relative world we are speaking about. .. so the nomenclature explains it.  
when a person is pure, he would like to cause as little suffering as possible  
to the world. .. and so he would prefer to eat purely vegetarian food.   
Exceptions like Nissargadatta & Vivekananda, Ramakrishna apart [we cannot  
discuss about Jnani's on the basis of their actions], its nice to be a  
vegetarian and have a compassionate heart!   
Love!

Once Bhagavan Ramana's sofa was full of bed bugs. These   
creatures were sucking the blood at their will. The attendants   
told this Bhagavan Ramana and He replied: Oh! do not bother,   
they will go away on their own, once they are bored with my blood.   
Next evening, when Bhagavan Ramana left for a stroll on the Hill,   
the attendants applied DDT (which had just then been invented)   
and cleared up the sofa. Bhagavan Ramana on return could find   
out the mischief with the smell. He said: "Oh, someone had played   
a trick on me." He left the matter at that.

Dear soham3,   
Each Brahma Jnani has got his peculiarities in behaviour. It all   
depends on his Prarabdha. Bhagavan Ramana was always quiet,   
very rarely giving room for anger but never uttered foul words.   
Seshadri Swami was behaving eccentrically, shouting at people,   
and even physically assaulting some of them. Sadasiva Brahmendra   
acted like a lunatic. Sri Ramakrishna was most of the times looking   
like a drunken man. But their Jnana-attainment was all the same.

If we understand ourselves then only we can understand others whether they are  
janani or ajanani. The real seeker may not consider the janani's looks,  
behaviour but will be attentive what he says. It is very difficult to know the  
real enlightened people. If we have good karma and God's grace we may meet  
them or they   
may come to our door and elevate us. To have such things in our life we just  
pray and read Ramana Bhagavan's books.

Dear soham3,   
 This has reference to your post on Sri.Nisargadatta Maharaj. **It is said that only a Jnani can recognize another Jnani**. Nisargdtta Maharaj's teaching are same as that of Bhagavan Ramana and what is important is to abide by his teachings instead of commenting on the personality.This forum being devoted to Bhgagavan Ramana Maharishi whose main teaching is to erase the ego, it will be better for the members of this forum to refrain from commenting on sages.   
Best regards

There have been instances when jnanis took shelter of jnana to indulge in  
crimes. Maharaj himself stated that he was not bound by morality.  
Jnanis do not indulge in anything, they just know they fulfil what  
predestined. But you're right: some ajnanis try to pretend to be jnanis to  
indulge themselves in crimes.   
Whether one is bound by morality or not, he will do exactly whatever  
preordained. There are millions of people who care a lot about morality and  
commit crimes (middleages inquisition for example)

O, come on friends, nobody has the "right" to judge anybody, jnani or whatever  
-- period. For that matter, how does one judge somebody jnani or whatever? I  
said "judge" not recognize what is being done.   
Okay, let's say we all agree that Sri So-and-So is jnani and he/she does some  
silly thing. What to do? Well, if what the fellow is doing looks silly,  
what's wrong with saying "that looks silly!" \-- none at all! But if we say,  
"So-and-So can't be jnani because he picked his nose in public" then we are  
off course. If there is such a thing as jnani, it is in Being not in Doing   
Another example: there was this Zen master, very respected, one day some  
robbers attacked him on the road and killed him -- his disciples were shocked  
to hear that he had screamed when he died. "How could this be?", they asked.  
"No," they were told, "you don't understand, his screams were heard five miles  
away!!!"

Dear everyone,   
Nice discussions. Why all these problems? Because Jnani is   
in a body. If he has left his body, then there will be only a   
Siva Lingam or a Cross over the samadhi or cemetry. Then   
no comments, no praises, no criticisms. The Jnani then becomes   
the Presence. That is why the Presence is quite powerful.   
Jnani with a body is always subject to criticism. There were   
people during Bhagavan Ramana's time, who were telling: What   
is this man? Wearing a coupinam, and walking with his curved legs? Doing no  
work. Then they would say to Shirdi Baba: O this guy   
is a fool, wearing a tattered gown and eating meat pieces. They   
would say to Sri Satya Sai Baba: O who is this guy, with huge   
growth of hair that looks like krotens? They would say to Seshadri Swamigal: Hey, this guy is a crackpot, wearing torn dhoti and banians and eating foul  
smelling old rice and shouting at everyone.   
For Sri Bhagavan Ramakrishna they would say: Who is this guy   
who always eats fish and luchi and dances as if he is drunk.   
There is no end.   
Do not see the Jnani with a body, or as a body. If you have faith in him,  
ignore everything. If you do not have faith in him, please   
stay away.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniam, I'm not sure you get my modest point which is, "Do not see  
_anybody_ simply as a body" There is a jnani hidden in every body. When this  
is seen, (dimly by most of us, of course), then one loves everybody, not with  
the intensity that God loves us, but love just the same -- in fact one loves  
the world, because the world is no longer the world but shot through with  
God's glory transforming it into His Reality.

Dear Chuck Cliff,   
I have no quarrel and I am only trying to tell you the dangers   
of seeing the Jnani only as a body. All mind's mischief starts   
only because of that. Is it not? After Bhagavan Ramana's   
Mahanirvana, many people thought that everything was over   
and they packed up to their places. Only a few like Chadwick,   
Arthur Osborne, Kunju Swami, Annamalai Swami and the   
Sarvadikari Chinnaswamy remained. But those guys who went   
away came back in one or two years, because Bhagavan Ramana   
was transmitting His grace not as a body but as the Presence.   
The Ramana Nagar colonly which became almost totally vacant started filling up  
slowly.   
I repeat, that I am taking your views as mine too. The dangers   
lurk only when one thinks othewrise.   
Arunachala Siva.

Nisargadatta Maharaj is often referred to as "a mystic with a stick".   
The stick has straightened many bends over the years and continues to do so.   
There were reasons why Maharaj sometimes told people to go away.   
His place of satsang was very small and could accomodate few people.   
Some people only came to show off instead of being really interested in the  
talks and Maharaj did not tolerate such attitudes. Also sometimes when Maharaj  
found that old timers preventing entry to new comers he told them to seat in  
the back seats and make space for new comers.   
Maharaj was not financially sound and his place of dwelling was small. He also  
had his own family. Under these circumstances he created suitable space for  
satsang and disseminated and gave talks spanning several years. This shows  
that his attitude was to help others. The "stick" methodology was used to help  
people in the shortest possible time. Out of his talks came the spiritual  
classic "I am That".
