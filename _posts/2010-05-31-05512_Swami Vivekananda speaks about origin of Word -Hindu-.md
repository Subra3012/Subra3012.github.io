**VEDANTISM Volume 3, Lectures from Colombo to Almora**   
 **The word Hindu, by which it is the fashion nowadays to style ourselves, has  
lost all its meaning, for this word merely meant those who lived on the other  
side of the river Indus (in Sanskrit, Sindhu).** This name was murdered into  
Hindu by the ancient Persians, and all people living on the other side of the  
river Sindhu were called by them Hindus. Thus this word has come down to us;  
and during the Mohammedan rule we took up the word ourselves. There may not be  
any harm in using the word of course; but, as I have said, it has lost its  
significance, for you may mark that all the people who live on this side of  
the Indus in modern times do not follow the same religion as they did in  
ancient times.   
**This mass of writing called the Vedas is not the utterance of persons. Its  
date has never been fixed, can never be fixed, and, according to us, the Vedas  
are eternal. There is one salient point which I want you to remember, that all  
the other religions of the world claim their authority as being delivered by a  
Personal God or a number of personal beings, angels, or special messengers of  
God, unto certain persons; while the claim of the Hindus is that the Vedas do  
not owe their authority to anybody, they are themselves the authority, being  
eternal  the knowledge of God. They were never written, never created, they  
have existed throughout time; just as creation is infinite and eternal,  
without beginning and without end, so is the knowledge of God without  
beginning and without end. And this knowledge is what is meant by the Vedas  
(Vid to know).**   
**This mass of writing, the Vedas, is divided principally into two parts, the  
Karma Kânda and the Jnâna Kânda  the work portion and the knowledge portion,  
the ceremonial and the spiritual.** The work portion consists of various  
sacrifices; most of them of late have been given up as not practicable under  
present circumstances, but others remain to the present day in some shape or  
other. The main ideas of the Karma Kanda, which consists of the duties of man,  
the duties of the student, of the householder, of the recluse, and the various  
duties of the different stations of life, are followed more or less down to  
the present day. But the spiritual portion of our religion is in the second  
part, the Jnana Kanda, the Vedanta, the end of the Vedas, the gist, the goal  
of the Vedas.   
Next to the Vedanta come the Smritis. These also are books written by sages,  
but the authority of the Smritis is subordinate to that of the Vedanta,  
because they stand in the same relation with us as the scriptures of the other  
religions stand with regard to them. We admit that the Smritis have been  
written by particular sages; in that sense they are the same as the scriptures  
of other religions, but these Smritis are not final authority. **If there is  
any thing in a Smriti which contradicts the Vedanta, the Smriti is to be  
rejected  its authority is gone.**   
 **Then there are the Purânas.** the Puranas are of five characteristics   
that which treats of history, of cosmology, with various symbological  
illustration of philosophical principles, and so forth. These were written to  
popularise the religion of the Vedas. The language in which the Vedas are  
written is very ancient, and even among scholars very few can trace the date  
of these books. The Puranas were written in the language of the people of that  
time, what we call modern Sanskrit. They were then meant not for scholars, but  
for the ordinary people; and ordinary people cannot understand philosophy.  
Such things were given unto them in concrete form, by means of the lives of  
saints and kinds and great men and historical events that happened to the race  
etc. The sages made use of these things to illustrate the eternal principles  
of religion.   
And above all, one thing is necessary. **First, learn to obey.**   
The command will come by itself. **Always first learn to be a servant, and  
then you will be fit to be a master.** Avoid this jealousy and you will do  
great works that have yet to be done. Our ancestors did most wonderful works,  
and we look back upon their work with veneration and pride. But we also are  
going to do great deeds, and let others look back with blessings and pride  
upon us as their ancestors. With the blessing of the Lord every one here will  
yet do such deeds that will eclipse those of our ancestors, great and glorious  
as they may have been.

Hinduism - is the name given by British who created many theories   
like Aryans and Dravidans and Aryans who gave Veda came from   
Indus Valley. Hence, Hindu.   
The correct name is Sanatana Dharma. It is basically dharma,   
a way of life, and not religion in the sense that we use it today.   
Arunachala Siva.
