The feeling of a need to work in order to gain happiness is the misery of  
miseries. How can there be pleasure or removal of pain so long as it  
continues?   
Only those who need not engage in action, are happy; they are perfectly  
content, and self contained, and they experience a happiness which extends to  
all the pores of the body   
How silly of people with innumerable obligations, ever too busy seeking such  
moments of pleasure in the world!   
Each of them having gained his end feels happy and considers himself blessed  
as if he had reached the goad of life. I too have been unwittingly imitating  
them like a blind man following the blind. Enough of this folly! I will at  
once return to that ocean of mercy - My Master

What is known as the mind is, after all, always like a restless monkey. So the   
ordinary is always afflicted with troubles. Everybody knows that restless mind   
is a channel of endless troubles; whereas one is happy in sleep in the absence   
of such restlessness. Therefore keep your mind steady when you listen to what   
I say. Hearing with a distracted mind is as good as not hearing, for the words   
serve no useful purpose, resembling the fruit-laden tree in a painting.   
Appropriate effort must follow right discussion; for a man profits according  
to   
the zeal accompanying his efforts.   
Guided by proper deliberation, accompanied by zeal and engaged in individual   
efforts, one must make one's own unfailing way to emancipation.   
There are said to be many ways to that end. Choose that one among them   
which is the surest.   
Choice is made by right discussion and according to the experience of the  
wise.   
Then begin the practice immediately   
Investigate the nature of the Self with intellect made transparently clear   
It is not an object to be perceived, not described; how shall I then tell you   
of it? You know the Mother only if you know your Self.   
The Self does not admit of specification, and therefore no teacher can teach  
it.   
However, realise the Self within you, for it abides in unblemished intellect.   
It pervades all, beginning from the personal God to the amoeba; but it is not   
cognisable by the mind or senses; being itself unilluminated by external  
agencies,   
It illumines all, everywhere and always. It surpasses demonstration or  
discussion.   
How, where, when, or by whom has it been specifically described even   
incompletely? What you ask me, dear, amounts to asking me to show your own   
eyes to you.   
Even the best teachers cannot bring your eyes to your sight. Just as a teacher   
is of no use in this instance, so in the other. He can best guide you towards  
it   
and nothing more. I shall also explain to you the means to realisation. Listen  
attentively.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Excellent. Bhagavan Ramana says in Who am I?   
1\. God and Guru will only show you the way, but not put you   
in deliverence.   
2\. Rama, should he go and see the mirror to know that he is Rama?   
He always knows himself. Similarly, to see the Self, within, one should see  
with the wisdom insight but not from others.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
Bhagawan's words are simply so lucid! We are all very much indebted to him for  
taking us all under his folds. How fortunate we are all? indeed very  
fortunate!   
I have been reading the Tripura Rahasya for the last few days and I have  
thoroughly been enjoying every moment of reading it. Its an amazing work from  
our scriptures. Such in depth and clear explanations. It actually clears a lot  
of hidden questions within. No wonder Sri Ramana asked devotees to read this  
grand work.   
This work is also known as Harithayana Samhita.   
Nagaraj

As long as you are contaminated with notions of _me_ or _mine_   
_(eg., my home, my body, my mind, my intellect)_, the Self will not be   
found, for it lies beyond cognition and cannot be realised as _' my Self'_.   
Retire into solitude, analyse and see what those things are which are congised   
as _mine_ ; discard them all and transcending them, look for the real Self.   
For instance, you know me as your wife and not as your self. I am only   
_related_ to you and _not part_ of you, much less your very being.   
Analyse everything in this way and discard it. What remains over,   
transcending it all, beyond conception, or relinquishment - know That to   
be the Self. That knowledge is final emancipation.   
Truly all these people are deluded! Not one of them knows even the fringe of   
the Self! But all are active for the sake of their own selves! Some of them   
recite the scriptures, a few study them and their commentaries; some are   
busy accumulating wealth; others are ruling the land; some are fighting the   
enemy; others are seeking the luxuries of life. When engaged in all this   
selfish activity they never question what exactly the Self may be; now why   
is there all this confusion? Oh! When the Self is not known, all is in vain  
and   
as if done in a dream. So I will now investigate the matter.   
My home, wealth, kingdom, treasure, woman, cattle none of these is _me_,   
and they are only _mine_. I certainly take the body for the Self but it is   
simply a tool of mine. I am indeed the king's son. with goodly limbs and a  
fair   
complexion. These people, too, are taken up by this same notion that their   
bodies are their egos.   
Reflecting thus, he considered the body. He could not identify the body as   
the Self, and so began to transcend it.  _This body is mine, not me '_. It is  
built   
up of blood and bones, and is changing each moment. How can this be   
the changeless, continuous _me_. It looks like a chattel, it is apart from me  
as   
is a waking body from the dream, etc. _I_ cannot be the body; nor can the   
vital force be the Self; mind and intellect are clearly my tools, so they  
cannot   
be _I. I_ am surely something apart from all these, beginning from the  
body   
and ending with the intellect.   
Nagaraj

Very well-directed guidance.   
There is a puzzle-like enquiry which goes thus:  _What is nearest to you?_   
The investigator starts with an external object, then comes nearer;   
to the body, then the mind.   
Upon asking him to identify something even nearer the mind,   
the investigator is puzzled for a moment.   
Reflection in that moment may give an intuitive sense of the pure  
consciousness underlying the mind.

Dear Silentgreen,   
Your post is excellent. _What is nearest to you_ exercise is definitely an  
excellent Sadhana. Slowly It will lead the pursuer within and take strong hold  
of the seeker.

Objects are cognised through the senses, not otherwise;   
life is recognised by touch, and mind by intellect.   
By whom is the intellect made evident? I do not know. ...   
I now see I am always aware. Realisation of that pure awareness   
is obstructed by other factors (pertaining to the nonself)   
butting in. Now I shall not imagine them. They cannot   
appear without my mental imagery of them and they cannot   
obstruct the glory of the Self, without appearing.   
Thinking thus, he forcibly arrested his thoughts.   
Instantaneously a blank superseded. He, at the   
same time, decided that it was the Self, so became very   
happy and once again he began to meditate. I will do it   
again, he said and plunged within.   
Regaining human consciousness, he began   
to wonder how this could happen: There is no constancy   
in the experience. The Self cannot be more than one. I   
will repeat and see, he said and dived again. This time he   
fell into a long sleep and dreamt wonderful dreams. On   
waking up, he began to think furiously: How is it that I was overpowered by sleep   
and started to dream? The darkness and light which I saw   
before must also be in the nature of dreams. Dreams are   
mental imagery, so how shall I overcome them?'   
I shall again repress my thoughts and see, he said,   
and plunged within. His mind was still for a time. He was   
sunk, as it were, in in a ocean of bliss.   
Shortly after, he regained his original state,   
owing to the mind again beginning to function. He   
reflected: What is all this? Is it a dream or a hallucination   
of the mind? My experience is a fact but it surpasses my   
imagination.   
Why is that bliss quite unique and unlike any that I   
have experienced before? The highest of my known   
experiences cannot compare with even an iota of the state of   
bliss I was in just now. It was like sleep, in so far as I was not   
externally aware. But there was a peculiar bliss at the same   
time. The reason is not clear to me because there was nothing   
to impart pleasure to me. Although I attempt to know the   
Self, I do not do so. I see the Self differently now and again.   
What can it be? Is it darkness, light or pleasure, etc. Or is   
it possible that these are successive forms of the Self? I do   
not understand it. Let me ask my recondite wife.   
Nagaraj

My dear! I have, as advised by you, retired to   
a solitary place where I am engaged in investigating the   
Self. Even so, I have diverse visions and experiences.   
Thinking that the constant Self-awareness is dimmed by   
the uncalled-for interference of mental activities, I forcibly   
repressed my thoughts and remained calm. Darkness   
superseded, light appeared, sleep supervened and finally a   
unique bliss overpowered me for a little while. Is this the   
Self, or something different? Please analyse these   
experiences of mine and tell me, my dear, so that I may   
clearly understand them.   
After listening to him carefully Hemalekha,   
the knower of this world and beyond, spoke sweetly thus: Listen to me, my dear, closely. What you have now done   
to restrain thoughts with the mind turned inward (vichara)   
is a good beginning and praised by the worthy as the best   
way. Without it, no one has ever been successful anywhere.   
However, it does not produce Self-realisation, for the Self   
remains realised at all times.   
If a product, it cannot be the Self. For, how can the   
Self be got anew? So then, the Self is never gained. Gain is of   
something which is not already possessed. Is there any   
moment when the Self is not the Self? Neither is control of   
mind used to gain it. I shall give you some examples: Just as things unseen in darkness are found on its   
removal by means of a lamp, and are therefore said to be   
recovered from oblivion.   
Just as a confused man forgets his purse, but   
remembers and locates it on keeping his mind unruffled   
and steady, yet still says that he has gained the lost purse,   
though the steadying of his mind did not produce it.   
So also the control of your mind is not the cause   
of your Self-realisation; though the Self is always there, it   
is not recognised by you even with a controlled mind   
because you are not conversant with it.   
Blank darkness was visible after you controlled your thoughts.   
In the short interval before its appearance and after the   
control of mind, there remains a state free from the effort to   
control and the perception of darkness.   
Always remember that state as the one of perfect   
and transcendental happiness. All are deceived in that state   
because their minds are accustomed to be turned outward.   
Though people may be learned, skilful and keen,   
still they search and search, only to be thwarted and they do   
not abide in that holy state.   
They grieve day and night, without knowing this   
state. Mere theoretical knowledge of sculpture can never   
make a man a sculptor.   
Though he be a pandit well grounded in the theory   
and the discussion of the philosophy of the Self, he cannot   
realise the Self because it is not realisable but already realised.   
Realisation is not attained by going far, but only by staying   
still; not by thought, but by cessation of thought.   
Effort towards Realisation is like the attempt to   
stamp with ones foot on the shadow cast by ones head. Effort   
will always make it recede.

Excellent. Such close and detailed guidance.   
 _Blank darkness was visible after you controlled your thoughts.

control of mind, there remains a state free from the effort to   
control and the perception of darkness.   
Always remember that state as the one of perfect   
and transcendental happiness. All are deceived in that state   
because their minds are accustomed to be turned outward._   
After reading this I had to leave things in a hurry and start reading Tripura  
Rahasya.   
I have read the likeness of such detailed guidance in another scripture which  
I cannot recollect now.

Dear silentgreen and Nagaraj,   
Excellent. What is nearest to us? The Self! It is not even nearest to us,  
it is Me! The Guru from outside pushes your into the Self. The Guru within  
pulls you in from inside. Ultimately the merger takes place. Saint  
Manikkavachagar says in Tiruvachakam, "Yan, yenathu enra urai moithu..." You  
make to stop thinking about me and mine and then takes me inside. For him,  
Guru came as an Effulgence, in   
Tiru Uttarakosa Mangai. Then the Guru came to him as a brahmin priest in Tiru  
Perundurai. The saint left everything. Merger took place in Chidambaram.   
Arunachala Siva.

They understand the universe in space but have no regard   
for space itself. Similarly, it is with them in regard to the Self.   
 _We always think about the pot space example but we often fail to realize  
that even the pot is within the space. We are that   
space and not the pot   
We are the rope itself and not the snake. we are not some other entity which  
sees the rope and snake. The rope itself see's itself as a snake. The rope  
cannot see itself   
_   
The world consists of knowledge and the objects known.   
Of these the objects are non-self and perceived by senses;   
knowledge is selfevident;there is no world in the absence of knowledge.   
Knowledge is the direct proof of the existence of objects   
which are therefore dependent on knowledge. Knowledge   
is dependent on the knower for its existence. The knower   
does not require any tests for knowing his own existence.   
The knower therefore is the only reality behind knowledge   
and objects. That which is self-evident without the   
necessity to be proved, is alone real; not so other things.   
 _When Self alone is how can it be known? To know infers 'to think' implies to  
search for something else to identify itself with? but is there anything apart  
from the Self? Its like the space trying to know itself as the pot within the  
space. The space but is. trying to know is like limiting the Self as a pot  
which is absurd_   
Therefore, realise with a still mind your own true nature   
which is the one pure, undivided Consciousness   
underlying the restless mind which is composed   
of the whole universe in all its diversity.   
If one is fixed in that fundamental basis of the   
universe (i.e., the Self ), one becomes the All-doer. I shall tell   
you how to inhere thus. I assure you  you will be That.   
Realise with a still mind the state between sleep and   
wakefulness, the interval between the recognition of one   
object after another or the gap between two perceptions.   
 _Now what it is to be with a still mind? common understanding is absence of  
thoughts. But actually it is not absence of thoughts but absence of thinking -  
'to think' or investigate. usual tendency is 'to think' or 'investigate' as to  
how to still our mind. Stillness is not achieved by thinking or investigating  
or analysing but only by the absence of all of these. To be still is to 'just  
be'   
**Mark this - It takes no effort to to 'not think' but takes a mammoth effort  
'to think'** But we always think contrary to this   
Really in the absence of 'to think' or 'thinking' whether we believe or not or  
want to buy it or not we are all abiding as that **' I AM'**   
Because in the absence of thinking or investigating the Self is as it is. As  
they say Self cannot be grasped by thinking. It is as it is_   
This is the real Self, inhering in which one is no   
longer deluded. Unaware of this Truth, people have become   
inheritors of sorrow.   
Now let not your mind be outgoing; turn it inward;   
control it just a little and watch for the Self, **always remembering   
that the investigator is himself the essence of being   
and the Self of self.**   
 _The investigator, investigation, and the object investigated are all one   
This being the case what is the Investigator searching for? \- Investigator  
investigation investigated is 'I' alone. If we realize this truth or  
understand this truth, we will stop our relentless search and abide as 'I' or  
'I am'   
If anything is to come after 'I am' it is obviously 'to think' Even to to  
think 'I am' is false. actually **' just be' !**   
to 'just be' is the absence of investigation or 'to think' or 'thinking'   
We will not even 'stop' as 'to stop' also is 'to think' or 'doership to stop'  
exists. we will 'just be' as we naturally are. what stops is 'to think' or 'to  
do' or 'the doership'   
'I am' _**that - 'I am'**_ You are that what you are  
imagining/searching/thinking to be. the investigator is already that what is  
being investigated. you are already that.   
_   
Be also free from the thought I see; remain still   
like a blind man seeing. What transcends sight and no   
sight, That you are. Be quick and be That.   
 _We should just be as 'I' alone, when you begin to see then it implies  
bondage - it includes waking and dream state. abiding just as 'I' is beyond  
these 2 states - what is called as the 'Turia'   
The target or goal or sadhana is to just abide as 'I' it implies or means  
being just a witness and not seeing thoughts as separate from 'I'   
The thoughts flow - it is natural but 'to think' is not natural, there is an  
effort here. what needs to be checked is 'to think' and not thoughts.   
Thoughts are there, let it be there. but Thinking implies doership.   
If thinking is absent, then there is just 'I am' here we need to think to know  
'I am' if begin to think then again its seer and seen.   
Very important to know the difference between 'thoughts' and 'to think'   
_
