Verse 43:- The Jnani who has achieved the siddhi (the state)   
gets the Aparoksha Jnana, direct knowledge of Brahman within.   
He will rest in Brahama pada, bereft of birth and death, and looks   
at the universe as a terrifying one. He behaves like a lunatic   
smearing mud on his body and roams about in the forests all alone.   
He is said to be in 'Unmani' state, the state in which he has   
found the ruby in his Heart, wherefrom nectar is flowing. He   
always lives in that state, even if he moves about with people   
of the world.   
Verse 44:- The self realized Jnani is a yoga siddha, that is,   
he will not perceive anything with his eyes or ears and speaks   
hardly any word and he is ever in Brahman and there are no   
rituals for him. He stands unaffected like a rock in a storm.   
Verse 45:- The Jnani is devoid of any caste, or clan and has   
no possessions, distinction or difference. He is a Brahma Vetta   
and there is no difference between Brahman and Brahma Vetta.   
He treats everyone like, even if they are learned priests, common   
peasant, a cow or an elephant or a lowly dog. He is from the   
unknown source to which he has returned. He is devoid of   
time and space. He is a kala-teeta, one who has transcended   
the three times (past, present and future) and the space.   
to be contd.....   
Arunachala Siva.

Jnani is like empty flute with holes through which God sings a celestial song.

Dear Raju, Yes. The Jnani is like a shuttle in the weaving   
machine. The weaver is Brahman, and the Jnani moves here   
and there, or stays put, as the the weaver, Brahman wants.   
He has not thinking or action of his own. This what Saint   
Manikkavachagar says in Tiruvachakam, Decad of Surrender.   
Arunachala Siva.
