## Tiruppavai - 23  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 07, 2010, 11:10:36 AM  
---  
The 23rd song of Tiruppavai, is sung today, the 23rd day of Dhanur,   
Margazhi, month. This is again a simple narrative song, continuing   
the them of waking up Narayana for the early morning bathing.   
The lion in the rainy season, comes out from its sleep, from out   
of the mountain-cave. It makes a roar and looks at the surroundings   
with its fire emitting eyes. O Narayana, the god with hue of blue   
lily, you too come out from your bed and ask us for what purpose,   
we have come to your doorstep, and then bless us.   
The Sri Vaishnava scholars say that the imagery to the lion is indicative of  
Narasimha avatara. Since AndaL has been referring   
to Vamana Avatara, Sri Ramaavatara and Sri Krishnavatara in the next song,  
they say that this song is a discreet reference to Narasimha Avatara.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Tiruppavai - 22  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 06, 2010, 09:32:21 AM

The 22nd song of Tiruppavai, is sung on this day, the 22nd day   
of Margazhi (Dhanur month). This again is a simple narrative song,   
perhaps with a discreet reference to Duryodana and Arjuna going   
to Krishna while the latter was lying on the bed, for support for   
their war at Gurukshetra.   
We are all coming to you Krishna, leaving all our ego, like the   
great kings who came to you leaving all their self respect, and   
stood beside your bed. Will you not, please direct towards us your lotus like  
eyes full of grace and it will be like sun and moon rising   
together. If you could show your gaze once towards us, all our   
sins will vanish and we shall merge at your lotus feet!   
Arunachala Siva.

## Tiruppavai - 24  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 09, 2010, 05:10:39 AM  
---  
Tiruppavai song no. 24 is sung on 24th day of Dhanur, Margazhi   
month, i.e. this year, on 8th Jan 2010. Here AndaL, the saint   
poetess describes the various avataras of Vishnu.   
O Narayana, the One who measured all the worlds with your feet*,   
glory to your feet! O the One who crossed over the ocean to Lanka   
and destroyed the demons**, glory to your valour! O the One who   
killed Sakatasura, glory to your fame! O the One who who killed   
demon who came as a calf and also killed the demon who came in the form of  
a Indian apple tree. O the One who raised   
the Govardhan mountain as an umbrella (to protect the cowherds   
and cows from torrential rains caused by Indra.). Glory to your   
features of courage. Glory to the Spear that is on your hand which   
is a nightmare to your enemies. We have come this early morning   
to sing your glory and attain your grace. Please take pity on us.   
* Vamana-Trivikarama Avatara.   
 Sri Rama Avatara   
 Krishna as a child killed Sakatasura who came in the form of   
 a fast moving cart-wheel.   
 One demon came as a calf to hit Krishna. He lifted that   
 calf and threw it on an Indian apple tree, which was also a   
 form taken by another demon. Both were killed.   
The lifting of Govardhana mountain as an umbrella to protect   
the cows and cowherds, is again in Krishna Avatara. Indra causes   
torrential rains, since puja was denied to him and instead offered   
to Govardhana mountain. Krishna lifted the Govardhana mountain   
with his little finger and raised it so that in the space below cows   
and cowherds rested without affected by rains. It lasted for 7 days.   
Srimad Bhagavatam says that Krishna also made the cows and cowherds to have no  
appetite or thirst or nature calls during these   
seven days!   
Arunachala Siva.

## How to watch the sense 'I am'  
Author: snow                Date: January 07, 2010, 03:06:33 PM  
---  
Nisargadatta Maharaj said that it is very important to watch "I-am-ness" all  
the time. I don't however understand what this sense "I Am" contains. Does it  
include seeing, smelling, hearing etc.? Should I be mindful of these also? Or  
is it enough if I just do like Maharshi said: "Get rid of your present  
thoughts, that is all."   
This however seems a little difficult (atleast when I'm not meditating). But  
would you say that just letting go of thinking is basically all that is  
necessary.

Author: silentgreen         Date: January 08, 2010, 03:54:19 AM

Dear Snow,   
Good question.   
It is the natural feeling of the sense of "I am" which Nisargadatta Maharaj is  
pointing to.   
This feeling is there even if we shut out our senses. For example: We can close our eyes and shut out the sense of vision. "I am" is still there.   
We can close our ears with our fingers and shut out the sense of hearing. "I  
am" is still there.   
We can close our mouth and shut out the sense of taste. "I am" is still there.   
So what is this "I am" which seems to be independent of senses etc.   
How far can we go towards its source?   
Bhagavan Ramana says to find out, "from where this 'I' arises".   
In the process attention will go towards the pure consciousness within.   
Nisargadatta Maharaj says to remain with the sense of "I am" at its root (as  
far as possible) without allowing thoughts to extend "I am" as "I am this or  
that" (like "I am Henry", "I am a teacher", "I am feeling hot" etc.). The  
effect of this is also to take one towards the pure consciousness within.

The state of I AM is simply I AM.   
It is defintely not I am this or I am that.   
I AM is the state of Existence/Witness.   
Dear snow, it is ver difficult to remain in that I AM. That is why   
Bhagavan Ramana said: Ask for whom this thought? It is for me.   
Who am I? Keep on killing the soldiers coming out of the enemy   
fortress. It is difficult, so Bhagavan said Atma Vidya is very easy.   
It is because, we are carrying huge dirt of thoughts and vasanas,   
from many previous births. Guru's Grace alone will remove it one   
stroke, like the Sun removes the darkness of a room, closed and kept in  
darkness for years.

Is this one necessary to say? Isn't it pretty obivious? I find this not to be  
as powerful question to the mind than "Who am I" which is (like Adyashanti  
said) an alarm clock thrown in the dream.   
And can Bhagavan be my guru even though he left his body decades ago?

Dear snow,   
"I find this one as not powerful question..." \- I am not clear   
as to what this question, which is not powerful, that you refer.   
Kindly let me know.   
Should Bhagavan Ramana be only living in a body, to be our Guru?   
He remained in body for some years. One cannot live for ever in   
body. Further, why do you associate a body, for selecting a guru?   
Only those who are body conscious should worry about the guru being   
in body. Is not His Presence, powerful enough, to be your Guru?   
His Presence is all pervading but the power is felt at its highest   
in His Samadhi as well as in Old Hall, where He sat for 23 years   
and guided devotees. If you visit T'malai next time, kindly sit   
in the Samadhi Hall or Old Hall, for about an hour. You shall   
definitely feel the Power of Presence, engulfing you.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear snow,   
Yes. Letting go of all thoughts about the objective world - is   
the thoughtless state, that is essential for self enquiry. Thought   
about God within, Bhagavan Ramana says, Atma Nishtaparan, in   
Who am I? is the greatest devotion. Hence this thought should   
be retained till it matures into surrender. Once the total surrender   
becomes your nature, there is no need even for thought of God, since   
there is only God within you and not any more of you.   
The question, for whom this thought arises? is necessary and must   
be continued, till worldly thoughts keep bothering you. At one stage, for  
whom this thought arises? - will not arise at all. That   
is abidance in Self. If this abidance in Self becomes permanent,   
then it is Sahaja Stithi. Thereafter every worldly activity of yours   
will be done by That, as Ribhu Gita, Ch.26 Verse 25 states.   
Arunachala Siva.

What is the feeling of existing ? Seek within. What is the feeling on  
existing ? Now.   
Sometimes I call myself to find myself : Q : hello ? A : hmm ? Q: hello ?  
A:ar hmmm ? Q:hello ? A:... I am here ?   
But I am is coloured by the impressions/conditioning picked up. Holding the I  
am, deeper and deeper into the I am you go, beyond the impressions until there  
is just I am, and then one step further. .. which cannot be described.

the sense of "Iam" is effortless, so making effort to reach it is

Dear I,   
It takes a mammoth effort to do something, to think and it takes absolutely no  
effort at all to simply be. This is the greatest irony that 'mind' thinks  
other wise and never rests! This is the essence of 'I am'   
Just cast of the very need to understand this and simply be. do not attempt to  
know or even bother to answer your question, cast of your very question  
itself, relax and just be. You do not need to know anything about "I am" that

Dear Nagaraj,   
This. .. "Cast off everything and just be". .. when you say it, someone takes  
it into the mind. And then, its a memory.   
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
how to cast off everything and just be ?   
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
You tell me... you told this. .. just be. .. but do u really remain like that?  
The point is simple. .. anger just comes in a moment's time! IT wont give you  
time enough to refer to your memory and find "who am i sentence" and do it!   
Love!   
Silence

Dear I,   
The moment you responded, you are not just being. You - 'I' \- Thoughts just  
don't want to be. see it wants to continue.   
Quote  
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
they don't come automatically, it comes because there is a need for all these  
emotions. To put it more clearly, these emotions arise because when any  
thought which arises and questions the very foundation of you - 'I' \- your  
thoughts, then it responds frantically, anger, fear, etc.. comes because it  
itself is under threat, its place is under question. hence these emotions  
arise.   
And at the same time, if any emotions such as comforting or happiness arises,  
it is nothing but anything that is conforming to what it already knows, it  
feels stronger, its place is assured, hence such emotions.   
emotions such as lust arise because of its inherent need of security to exist  
permanently. Lust need not necessarily be physical, money, material etc.. are  
all accumulated because of insecurity or incmpleteness.   
Quote  
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
If the person is already as you say Just Is, then he would not have posted it  
here. and as you say "if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement  
does not help him. .. coz his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no  
choice." is because, thoughts have to die, Manonasham is this. Thoughts - you  
- 'I' need thoughts to survive.   
The very moment you read this post you have already put effort. Just Be is  
zero effort. zero thinking, where you can't see that you are not thinking for  
if you begin to see that you are not thinking, you have put an effort there.  
Just Be.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

## How to watch the sense 'I am'  
Author: snow                Date: January 07, 2010, 03:06:33 PM  
---  
Nisargadatta Maharaj said that it is very important to watch "I-am-ness" all  
the time. I don't however understand what this sense "I Am" contains. Does it  
include seeing, smelling, hearing etc.? Should I be mindful of these also? Or  
is it enough if I just do like Maharshi said: "Get rid of your present  
thoughts, that is all."   
This however seems a little difficult (atleast when I'm not meditating). But  
would you say that just letting go of thinking is basically all that is  
necessary.

Dear Snow,   
Good question.   
It is the natural feeling of the sense of "I am" which Nisargadatta Maharaj is  
pointing to.   
This feeling is there even if we shut out our senses. For example: We can close our eyes and shut out the sense of vision. "I am" is still there.   
We can close our ears with our fingers and shut out the sense of hearing. "I  
am" is still there.   
We can close our mouth and shut out the sense of taste. "I am" is still there.   
So what is this "I am" which seems to be independent of senses etc.   
How far can we go towards its source?   
Bhagavan Ramana says to find out, "from where this 'I' arises".   
In the process attention will go towards the pure consciousness within.   
Nisargadatta Maharaj says to remain with the sense of "I am" at its root (as  
far as possible) without allowing thoughts to extend "I am" as "I am this or  
that" (like "I am Henry", "I am a teacher", "I am feeling hot" etc.). The  
effect of this is also to take one towards the pure consciousness within.

The state of I AM is simply I AM.   
It is defintely not I am this or I am that.   
I AM is the state of Existence/Witness.   
Dear snow, it is ver difficult to remain in that I AM. That is why   
Bhagavan Ramana said: Ask for whom this thought? It is for me.   
Who am I? Keep on killing the soldiers coming out of the enemy   
fortress. It is difficult, so Bhagavan said Atma Vidya is very easy.   
It is because, we are carrying huge dirt of thoughts and vasanas,   
from many previous births. Guru's Grace alone will remove it one   
stroke, like the Sun removes the darkness of a room, closed and kept in  
darkness for years.

Is this one necessary to say? Isn't it pretty obivious? I find this not to be  
as powerful question to the mind than "Who am I" which is (like Adyashanti  
said) an alarm clock thrown in the dream.   
And can Bhagavan be my guru even though he left his body decades ago?

Dear snow,   
"I find this one as not powerful question..." \- I am not clear   
as to what this question, which is not powerful, that you refer.   
Kindly let me know.   
Should Bhagavan Ramana be only living in a body, to be our Guru?   
He remained in body for some years. One cannot live for ever in   
body. Further, why do you associate a body, for selecting a guru?   
Only those who are body conscious should worry about the guru being   
in body. Is not His Presence, powerful enough, to be your Guru?   
His Presence is all pervading but the power is felt at its highest   
in His Samadhi as well as in Old Hall, where He sat for 23 years   
and guided devotees. If you visit T'malai next time, kindly sit   
in the Samadhi Hall or Old Hall, for about an hour. You shall   
definitely feel the Power of Presence, engulfing you.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear snow,   
Yes. Letting go of all thoughts about the objective world - is   
the thoughtless state, that is essential for self enquiry. Thought   
about God within, Bhagavan Ramana says, Atma Nishtaparan, in   
Who am I? is the greatest devotion. Hence this thought should   
be retained till it matures into surrender. Once the total surrender   
becomes your nature, there is no need even for thought of God, since   
there is only God within you and not any more of you.   
The question, for whom this thought arises? is necessary and must   
be continued, till worldly thoughts keep bothering you. At one stage, for  
whom this thought arises? - will not arise at all. That   
is abidance in Self. If this abidance in Self becomes permanent,   
then it is Sahaja Stithi. Thereafter every worldly activity of yours   
will be done by That, as Ribhu Gita, Ch.26 Verse 25 states.   
Arunachala Siva.

What is the feeling of existing ? Seek within. What is the feeling on  
existing ? Now.   
Sometimes I call myself to find myself : Q : hello ? A : hmm ? Q: hello ?  
A:ar hmmm ? Q:hello ? A:... I am here ?   
But I am is coloured by the impressions/conditioning picked up. Holding the I  
am, deeper and deeper into the I am you go, beyond the impressions until there  
is just I am, and then one step further. .. which cannot be described.

the sense of "Iam" is effortless, so making effort to reach it is  
impossible..you can try but hte more oyu try the more you will be hard in the

noone has ever seen this "Iam"...it is not an object to meditate about, infact  
the more we try to reach it the more we are in ignorance of our true nature   
warding of thoughts cna be missunderstood, beeing thougtless is nice but  
temporary what we look for is ever present conciousness...wich does not care

Dear I,   
It takes a mammoth effort to do something, to think and it takes absolutely no  
effort at all to simply be. This is the greatest irony that 'mind' thinks  
other wise and never rests! This is the essence of 'I am'   
Just cast of the very need to understand this and simply be. do not attempt to  
know or even bother to answer your question, cast of your very question  
itself, relax and just be. You do not need to know anything about "I am" that  
is really being 'I am'

Dear I,   
The moment you responded, you are not just being. You - 'I' \- Thoughts just  
don't want to be. see it wants to continue.   
Quote  
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
they don't come automatically, it comes because there is a need for all these  
emotions. To put it more clearly, these emotions arise because when any  
thought which arises and questions the very foundation of you - 'I' \- your  
thoughts, then it responds frantically, anger, fear, etc.. comes because it  
itself is under threat, its place is under question. hence these emotions  
arise.   
And at the same time, if any emotions such as comforting or happiness arises,  
it is nothing but anything that is conforming to what it already knows, it  
feels stronger, its place is assured, hence such emotions.   
emotions such as lust arise because of its inherent need of security to exist  
permanently. Lust need not necessarily be physical, money, material etc.. are  
all accumulated because of insecurity or incmpleteness.   
Quote  
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
If the person is already as you say Just Is, then he would not have posted it  
here. and as you say "if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement  
does not help him. .. coz his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no  
choice." is because, thoughts have to die, Manonasham is this. Thoughts - you  
- 'I' need thoughts to survive.   
The very moment you read this post you have already put effort. Just Be is  
zero effort. zero thinking, where you can't see that you are not thinking for  
if you begin to see that you are not thinking, you have put an effort there.  
Just Be.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

## How to watch the sense 'I am'  
Author: snow                Date: January 07, 2010, 03:06:33 PM

Nisargadatta Maharaj said that it is very important to watch "I-am-ness" all  
the time. I don't however understand what this sense "I Am" contains. Does it  
include seeing, smelling, hearing etc.? Should I be mindful of these also? Or  
is it enough if I just do like Maharshi said: "Get rid of your present  
thoughts, that is all."   
This however seems a little difficult (atleast when I'm not meditating). But  
would you say that just letting go of thinking is basically all that is  
necessary.

Dear Snow,   
Good question.   
It is the natural feeling of the sense of "I am" which Nisargadatta Maharaj is  
pointing to.   
This feeling is there even if we shut out our senses. For example: We can close our eyes and shut out the sense of vision. "I am" is still there.   
We can close our ears with our fingers and shut out the sense of hearing. "I  
am" is still there.   
We can close our mouth and shut out the sense of taste. "I am" is still there.   
So what is this "I am" which seems to be independent of senses etc.   
How far can we go towards its source?   
Bhagavan Ramana says to find out, "from where this 'I' arises".   
In the process attention will go towards the pure consciousness within.   
Nisargadatta Maharaj says to remain with the sense of "I am" at its root (as  
far as possible) without allowing thoughts to extend "I am" as "I am this or  
that" (like "I am Henry", "I am a teacher", "I am feeling hot" etc.). The  
effect of this is also to take one towards the pure consciousness within.

The state of I AM is simply I AM.   
It is defintely not I am this or I am that.   
I AM is the state of Existence/Witness.   
Dear snow, it is ver difficult to remain in that I AM. That is why   
Bhagavan Ramana said: Ask for whom this thought? It is for me.   
Who am I? Keep on killing the soldiers coming out of the enemy   
fortress. It is difficult, so Bhagavan said Atma Vidya is very easy.   
It is because, we are carrying huge dirt of thoughts and vasanas,   
from many previous births. Guru's Grace alone will remove it one   
stroke, like the Sun removes the darkness of a room, closed and kept in  
darkness for years.

Is this one necessary to say? Isn't it pretty obivious? I find this not to be  
as powerful question to the mind than "Who am I" which is (like Adyashanti  
said) an alarm clock thrown in the dream.   
And can Bhagavan be my guru even though he left his body decades ago?

Dear snow,   
"I find this one as not powerful question..." \- I am not clear   
as to what this question, which is not powerful, that you refer.   
Kindly let me know.   
Should Bhagavan Ramana be only living in a body, to be our Guru?   
He remained in body for some years. One cannot live for ever in   
body. Further, why do you associate a body, for selecting a guru?   
Only those who are body conscious should worry about the guru being   
in body. Is not His Presence, powerful enough, to be your Guru?   
His Presence is all pervading but the power is felt at its highest   
in His Samadhi as well as in Old Hall, where He sat for 23 years   
and guided devotees. If you visit T'malai next time, kindly sit   
in the Samadhi Hall or Old Hall, for about an hour. You shall   
definitely feel the Power of Presence, engulfing you.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear snow,   
Yes. Letting go of all thoughts about the objective world - is   
the thoughtless state, that is essential for self enquiry. Thought   
about God within, Bhagavan Ramana says, Atma Nishtaparan, in   
Who am I? is the greatest devotion. Hence this thought should   
be retained till it matures into surrender. Once the total surrender   
becomes your nature, there is no need even for thought of God, since   
there is only God within you and not any more of you.   
The question, for whom this thought arises? is necessary and must   
be continued, till worldly thoughts keep bothering you. At one stage, for  
whom this thought arises? - will not arise at all. That   
is abidance in Self. If this abidance in Self becomes permanent,   
then it is Sahaja Stithi. Thereafter every worldly activity of yours   
will be done by That, as Ribhu Gita, Ch.26 Verse 25 states.   
Arunachala Siva.

What is the feeling of existing ? Seek within. What is the feeling on  
existing ? Now.   
Sometimes I call myself to find myself : Q : hello ? A : hmm ? Q: hello ?  
A:ar hmmm ? Q:hello ? A:... I am here ?   
But I am is coloured by the impressions/conditioning picked up. Holding the I  
am, deeper and deeper into the I am you go, beyond the impressions until there  
is just I am, and then one step further. .. which cannot be described.

dear snow I would like to anwer your first questions..   
the sense of "Iam" is effortless, so making effort to reach it is  
impossible..you can try but hte more oyu try the more you will be hard in the  
chest, the energy will move to your head and you will find meditaitng is very  
exhausting...   
this is a misstake that I do and others do...so maybe this could save some  
time   
noone has ever seen this "Iam"...it is not an object to meditate about, infact  
the more we try to reach it the more we are in ignorance of our true nature   
warding of thoughts cna be missunderstood, beeing thougtless is nice but  
temporary what we look for is ever present conciousness...wich does not care  
aout our thoughts...so best thing is to be that wich does not care wether

Dear I,   
It takes a mammoth effort to do something, to think and it takes absolutely no  
effort at all to simply be. This is the greatest irony that 'mind' thinks  
other wise and never rests! This is the essence of 'I am'   
Just cast of the very need to understand this and simply be. do not attempt to  
know or even bother to answer your question, cast of your very question  
itself, relax and just be. You do not need to know anything about "I am" that  
is really being 'I am'

Dear Nagaraj,   
This. .. "Cast off everything and just be". .. when you say it, someone takes  
it into the mind. And then, its a memory.   
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
how to cast off everything and just be ?   
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
You tell me... you told this. .. just be. .. but do u really remain like that?  
The point is simple. .. anger just comes in a moment's time! IT wont give you  
time enough to refer to your memory and find "who am i sentence" and do it!

does not help him. .. coz his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no  
choice." is because, thoughts have to die, Manonasham is this. Thoughts - you  
- 'I' need thoughts to survive.   
The very moment you read this post you have already put effort. Just Be is  
zero effort. zero thinking, where you can't see that you are not thinking for  
if you begin to see that you are not thinking, you have put an effort there.  
Just Be.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

## How to watch the sense 'I am'  
Author: snow                Date: January 07, 2010, 03:06:33 PM  
---  
Nisargadatta Maharaj said that it is very important to watch "I-am-ness" all  
the time. I don't however understand what this sense "I Am" contains. Does it  
include seeing, smelling, hearing etc.? Should I be mindful of these also? Or  
is it enough if I just do like Maharshi said: "Get rid of your present  
thoughts, that is all."   
This however seems a little difficult (atleast when I'm not meditating). But  
would you say that just letting go of thinking is basically all that is  
necessary.

Dear Snow,   
Good question.   
It is the natural feeling of the sense of "I am" which Nisargadatta Maharaj is  
pointing to.   
This feeling is there even if we shut out our senses. For example: We can close our eyes and shut out the sense of vision. "I am" is still there.   
We can close our ears with our fingers and shut out the sense of hearing. "I  
am" is still there.   
We can close our mouth and shut out the sense of taste. "I am" is still there.   
So what is this "I am" which seems to be independent of senses etc.   
How far can we go towards its source?   
Bhagavan Ramana says to find out, "from where this 'I' arises".   
In the process attention will go towards the pure consciousness within.   
Nisargadatta Maharaj says to remain with the sense of "I am" at its root (as  
far as possible) without allowing thoughts to extend "I am" as "I am this or  
that" (like "I am Henry", "I am a teacher", "I am feeling hot" etc.). The  
effect of this is also to take one towards the pure consciousness within.

The state of I AM is simply I AM.   
It is defintely not I am this or I am that.   
I AM is the state of Existence/Witness.   
Dear snow, it is ver difficult to remain in that I AM. That is why   
Bhagavan Ramana said: Ask for whom this thought? It is for me.   
Who am I? Keep on killing the soldiers coming out of the enemy   
fortress. It is difficult, so Bhagavan said Atma Vidya is very easy.   
It is because, we are carrying huge dirt of thoughts and vasanas,   
from many previous births. Guru's Grace alone will remove it one   
stroke, like the Sun removes the darkness of a room, closed and kept in  
darkness for years.

Is this one necessary to say? Isn't it pretty obivious? I find this not to be  
as powerful question to the mind than "Who am I" which is (like Adyashanti  
said) an alarm clock thrown in the dream.   
And can Bhagavan be my guru even though he left his body decades ago?

Dear snow,   
"I find this one as not powerful question..." \- I am not clear   
as to what this question, which is not powerful, that you refer.   
Kindly let me know.   
Should Bhagavan Ramana be only living in a body, to be our Guru?   
He remained in body for some years. One cannot live for ever in   
body. Further, why do you associate a body, for selecting a guru?   
Only those who are body conscious should worry about the guru being   
in body. Is not His Presence, powerful enough, to be your Guru?   
His Presence is all pervading but the power is felt at its highest   
in His Samadhi as well as in Old Hall, where He sat for 23 years   
and guided devotees. If you visit T'malai next time, kindly sit   
in the Samadhi Hall or Old Hall, for about an hour. You shall   
definitely feel the Power of Presence, engulfing you.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear snow,   
Yes. Letting go of all thoughts about the objective world - is   
the thoughtless state, that is essential for self enquiry. Thought   
about God within, Bhagavan Ramana says, Atma Nishtaparan, in   
Who am I? is the greatest devotion. Hence this thought should   
be retained till it matures into surrender. Once the total surrender   
becomes your nature, there is no need even for thought of God, since   
there is only God within you and not any more of you.   
The question, for whom this thought arises? is necessary and must   
be continued, till worldly thoughts keep bothering you. At one stage, for  
whom this thought arises? - will not arise at all. That   
is abidance in Self. If this abidance in Self becomes permanent,   
then it is Sahaja Stithi. Thereafter every worldly activity of yours   
will be done by That, as Ribhu Gita, Ch.26 Verse 25 states.   
Arunachala Siva.

What is the feeling of existing ? Seek within. What is the feeling on  
existing ? Now.   
Sometimes I call myself to find myself : Q : hello ? A : hmm ? Q: hello ?  
A:ar hmmm ? Q:hello ? A:... I am here ?   
But I am is coloured by the impressions/conditioning picked up. Holding the I  
am, deeper and deeper into the I am you go, beyond the impressions until there  
is just I am, and then one step further. .. which cannot be described.

the sense of "Iam" is effortless, so making effort to reach it is  
impossible..you can try but hte more oyu try the more you will be hard in the  
chest, the energy will move to your head and you will find meditaitng is very

this is a misstake that I do and others do...so maybe this could save some

noone has ever seen this "Iam"...it is not an object to meditate about, infact  
the more we try to reach it the more we are in ignorance of our true nature   
warding of thoughts cna be missunderstood, beeing thougtless is nice but  
temporary what we look for is ever present conciousness...wich does not care

Dear I,   
It takes a mammoth effort to do something, to think and it takes absolutely no  
effort at all to simply be. This is the greatest irony that 'mind' thinks  
other wise and never rests! This is the essence of 'I am'   
Just cast of the very need to understand this and simply be. do not attempt to  
know or even bother to answer your question, cast of your very question  
itself, relax and just be. You do not need to know anything about "I am" that  
is really being 'I am'

Dear Nagaraj,   
This. .. "Cast off everything and just be". .. when you say it, someone takes  
it into the mind. And then, its a memory.   
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
how to cast off everything and just be ?   
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
You tell me... you told this. .. just be. .. but do u really remain like that?  
The point is simple. .. anger just comes in a moment's time! IT wont give you  
time enough to refer to your memory and find "who am i sentence" and do it!   
Love!

Dear I,   
The moment you responded, you are not just being. You - 'I' \- Thoughts just  
don't want to be. see it wants to continue.   
Quote  
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
they don't come automatically, it comes because there is a need for all these  
emotions. To put it more clearly, these emotions arise because when any  
thought which arises and questions the very foundation of you - 'I' \- your  
thoughts, then it responds frantically, anger, fear, etc.. comes because it  
itself is under threat, its place is under question. hence these emotions  
arise.   
And at the same time, if any emotions such as comforting or happiness arises,  
it is nothing but anything that is conforming to what it already knows, it  
feels stronger, its place is assured, hence such emotions.   
emotions such as lust arise because of its inherent need of security to exist  
permanently. Lust need not necessarily be physical, money, material etc.. are  
all accumulated because of insecurity or incmpleteness.

Dear Snow,   
Good question.   
It is the natural feeling of the sense of "I am" which Nisargadatta Maharaj is  
pointing to.   
This feeling is there even if we shut out our senses. For example: We can close our eyes and shut out the sense of vision. "I am" is still there.   
We can close our ears with our fingers and shut out the sense of hearing. "I  
am" is still there.   
We can close our mouth and shut out the sense of taste. "I am" is still there.   
So what is this "I am" which seems to be independent of senses etc.   
How far can we go towards its source?   
Bhagavan Ramana says to find out, "from where this 'I' arises".   
In the process attention will go towards the pure consciousness within.   
Nisargadatta Maharaj says to remain with the sense of "I am" at its root (as  
far as possible) without allowing thoughts to extend "I am" as "I am this or  
that" (like "I am Henry", "I am a teacher", "I am feeling hot" etc.). The  
effect of this is also to take one towards the pure consciousness within.

The state of I AM is simply I AM.   
It is defintely not I am this or I am that.   
I AM is the state of Existence/Witness.   
Dear snow, it is ver difficult to remain in that I AM. That is why   
Bhagavan Ramana said: Ask for whom this thought? It is for me.   
Who am I? Keep on killing the soldiers coming out of the enemy   
fortress. It is difficult, so Bhagavan said Atma Vidya is very easy.   
It is because, we are carrying huge dirt of thoughts and vasanas,   
from many previous births. Guru's Grace alone will remove it one   
stroke, like the Sun removes the darkness of a room, closed and kept in  
darkness for years.

Dear snow,   
"I find this one as not powerful question..." \- I am not clear   
as to what this question, which is not powerful, that you refer.   
Kindly let me know.   
Should Bhagavan Ramana be only living in a body, to be our Guru?   
He remained in body for some years. One cannot live for ever in   
body. Further, why do you associate a body, for selecting a guru?   
Only those who are body conscious should worry about the guru being   
in body. Is not His Presence, powerful enough, to be your Guru?   
His Presence is all pervading but the power is felt at its highest   
in His Samadhi as well as in Old Hall, where He sat for 23 years   
and guided devotees. If you visit T'malai next time, kindly sit   
in the Samadhi Hall or Old Hall, for about an hour. You shall   
definitely feel the Power of Presence, engulfing you.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear snow,   
Yes. Letting go of all thoughts about the objective world - is   
the thoughtless state, that is essential for self enquiry. Thought   
about God within, Bhagavan Ramana says, Atma Nishtaparan, in   
Who am I? is the greatest devotion. Hence this thought should   
be retained till it matures into surrender. Once the total surrender   
becomes your nature, there is no need even for thought of God, since   
there is only God within you and not any more of you.   
The question, for whom this thought arises? is necessary and must   
be continued, till worldly thoughts keep bothering you. At one stage, for  
whom this thought arises? - will not arise at all. That   
is abidance in Self. If this abidance in Self becomes permanent,   
then it is Sahaja Stithi. Thereafter every worldly activity of yours   
will be done by That, as Ribhu Gita, Ch.26 Verse 25 states.   
Arunachala Siva.

What is the feeling of existing ? Seek within. What is the feeling on  
existing ? Now.   
Sometimes I call myself to find myself : Q : hello ? A : hmm ? Q: hello ?  
A:ar hmmm ? Q:hello ? A:... I am here ?   
But I am is coloured by the impressions/conditioning picked up. Holding the I  
am, deeper and deeper into the I am you go, beyond the impressions until there  
is just I am, and then one step further. .. which cannot be described.

Dear I,   
It takes a mammoth effort to do something, to think and it takes absolutely no  
effort at all to simply be. This is the greatest irony that 'mind' thinks  
other wise and never rests! This is the essence of 'I am'   
Just cast of the very need to understand this and simply be. do not attempt to  
know or even bother to answer your question, cast of your very question  
itself, relax and just be. You do not need to know anything about "I am" that  
is really being 'I am'

Dear Nagaraj,

But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come

how to cast off everything and just be ?   
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
You tell me... you told this. .. just be. .. but do u really remain like that?  
The point is simple. .. anger just comes in a moment's time! IT wont give you  
time enough to refer to your memory and find "who am i sentence" and do it!

Dear I,   
The moment you responded, you are not just being. You - 'I' \- Thoughts just  
don't want to be. see it wants to continue.   
Quote  
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
they don't come automatically, it comes because there is a need for all these  
emotions. To put it more clearly, these emotions arise because when any  
thought which arises and questions the very foundation of you - 'I' \- your  
thoughts, then it responds frantically, anger, fear, etc.. comes because it  
itself is under threat, its place is under question. hence these emotions  
arise.   
And at the same time, if any emotions such as comforting or happiness arises,  
it is nothing but anything that is conforming to what it already knows, it  
feels stronger, its place is assured, hence such emotions.   
emotions such as lust arise because of its inherent need of security to exist  
permanently. Lust need not necessarily be physical, money, material etc.. are  
all accumulated because of insecurity or incmpleteness.   
Quote  
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.

If the person is already as you say Just Is, then he would not have posted it  
here. and as you say "if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement  
does not help him. .. coz his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no  
choice." is because, thoughts have to die, Manonasham is this. Thoughts - you  
- 'I' need thoughts to survive.   
The very moment you read this post you have already put effort. Just Be is  
zero effort. zero thinking, where you can't see that you are not thinking for  
if you begin to see that you are not thinking, you have put an effort there.  
Just Be.

## How to watch the sense 'I am'  
Author: snow                Date: January 07, 2010, 03:06:33 PM  
---  
Nisargadatta Maharaj said that it is very important to watch "I-am-ness" all  
the time. I don't however understand what this sense "I Am" contains. Does it  
include seeing, smelling, hearing etc.? Should I be mindful of these also? Or  
is it enough if I just do like Maharshi said: "Get rid of your present  
thoughts, that is all."   
This however seems a little difficult (atleast when I'm not meditating). But  
would you say that just letting go of thinking is basically all that is  
necessary.

Dear Snow,   
Good question.   
It is the natural feeling of the sense of "I am" which Nisargadatta Maharaj is  
pointing to.   
This feeling is there even if we shut out our senses. For example: We can close our eyes and shut out the sense of vision. "I am" is still there.   
We can close our ears with our fingers and shut out the sense of hearing. "I  
am" is still there.   
We can close our mouth and shut out the sense of taste. "I am" is still there.   
So what is this "I am" which seems to be independent of senses etc.   
How far can we go towards its source?   
Bhagavan Ramana says to find out, "from where this 'I' arises".   
In the process attention will go towards the pure consciousness within.   
Nisargadatta Maharaj says to remain with the sense of "I am" at its root (as  
far as possible) without allowing thoughts to extend "I am" as "I am this or  
that" (like "I am Henry", "I am a teacher", "I am feeling hot" etc.). The  
effect of this is also to take one towards the pure consciousness within.

The state of I AM is simply I AM.   
It is defintely not I am this or I am that.   
I AM is the state of Existence/Witness.   
Dear snow, it is ver difficult to remain in that I AM. That is why   
Bhagavan Ramana said: Ask for whom this thought? It is for me.   
Who am I? Keep on killing the soldiers coming out of the enemy   
fortress. It is difficult, so Bhagavan said Atma Vidya is very easy.   
It is because, we are carrying huge dirt of thoughts and vasanas,

Dear Snow,   
Good question.   
It is the natural feeling of the sense of "I am" which Nisargadatta Maharaj is  
pointing to.   
This feeling is there even if we shut out our senses. For example: We can close our eyes and shut out the sense of vision. "I am" is still there.   
We can close our ears with our fingers and shut out the sense of hearing. "I  
am" is still there.   
We can close our mouth and shut out the sense of taste. "I am" is still there.   
So what is this "I am" which seems to be independent of senses etc.   
How far can we go towards its source?   
Bhagavan Ramana says to find out, "from where this 'I' arises".   
In the process attention will go towards the pure consciousness within.   
Nisargadatta Maharaj says to remain with the sense of "I am" at its root (as  
far as possible) without allowing thoughts to extend "I am" as "I am this or  
that" (like "I am Henry", "I am a teacher", "I am feeling hot" etc.). The  
effect of this is also to take one towards the pure consciousness within.   
Thanks this is very helpful. =)

Is this one necessary to say? Isn't it pretty obivious? I find this not to be  
as powerful question to the mind than "Who am I" which is (like Adyashanti  
said) an alarm clock thrown in the dream.   
And can Bhagavan be my guru even though he left his body decades ago?

Dear snow,   
"I find this one as not powerful question..." \- I am not clear   
as to what this question, which is not powerful, that you refer.   
Kindly let me know.   
Should Bhagavan Ramana be only living in a body, to be our Guru?   
He remained in body for some years. One cannot live for ever in   
body. Further, why do you associate a body, for selecting a guru?   
Only those who are body conscious should worry about the guru being   
in body. Is not His Presence, powerful enough, to be your Guru?   
His Presence is all pervading but the power is felt at its highest   
in His Samadhi as well as in Old Hall, where He sat for 23 years   
and guided devotees. If you visit T'malai next time, kindly sit   
in the Samadhi Hall or Old Hall, for about an hour. You shall   
definitely feel the Power of Presence, engulfing you.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear snow,   
Yes. Letting go of all thoughts about the objective world - is   
the thoughtless state, that is essential for self enquiry. Thought   
about God within, Bhagavan Ramana says, Atma Nishtaparan, in   
Who am I? is the greatest devotion. Hence this thought should   
be retained till it matures into surrender. Once the total surrender   
becomes your nature, there is no need even for thought of God, since   
there is only God within you and not any more of you.   
The question, for whom this thought arises? is necessary and must   
be continued, till worldly thoughts keep bothering you. At one stage, for  
whom this thought arises? - will not arise at all. That   
is abidance in Self. If this abidance in Self becomes permanent,   
then it is Sahaja Stithi. Thereafter every worldly activity of yours   
will be done by That, as Ribhu Gita, Ch.26 Verse 25 states.   
Arunachala Siva.

What is the feeling of existing ? Seek within. What is the feeling on  
existing ? Now.   
Sometimes I call myself to find myself : Q : hello ? A : hmm ? Q: hello ?  
A:ar hmmm ? Q:hello ? A:... I am here ?   
But I am is coloured by the impressions/conditioning picked up. Holding the I  
am, deeper and deeper into the I am you go, beyond the impressions until there  
is just I am, and then one step further. .. which cannot be described.

Dear I,   
It takes a mammoth effort to do something, to think and it takes absolutely no  
effort at all to simply be. This is the greatest irony that 'mind' thinks  
other wise and never rests! This is the essence of 'I am'   
Just cast of the very need to understand this and simply be. do not attempt to  
know or even bother to answer your question, cast of your very question  
itself, relax and just be. You do not need to know anything about "I am" that  
is really being 'I am'

Dear Nagaraj,   
This. .. "Cast off everything and just be". .. when you say it, someone takes  
it into the mind. And then, its a memory.   
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
how to cast off everything and just be ?   
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
You tell me... you told this. .. just be. .. but do u really remain like that?  
The point is simple. .. anger just comes in a moment's time! IT wont give you  
time enough to refer to your memory and find "who am i sentence" and do it!   
Love!

Dear I,   
The moment you responded, you are not just being. You - 'I' \- Thoughts just  
don't want to be. see it wants to continue.   
Quote  
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
they don't come automatically, it comes because there is a need for all these  
emotions. To put it more clearly, these emotions arise because when any  
thought which arises and questions the very foundation of you - 'I' \- your  
thoughts, then it responds frantically, anger, fear, etc.. comes because it  
itself is under threat, its place is under question. hence these emotions  
arise.   
And at the same time, if any emotions such as comforting or happiness arises,  
it is nothing but anything that is conforming to what it already knows, it  
feels stronger, its place is assured, hence such emotions.   
emotions such as lust arise because of its inherent need of security to exist  
permanently. Lust need not necessarily be physical, money, material etc.. are  
all accumulated because of insecurity or incmpleteness.   
Quote  
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz

If the person is already as you say Just Is, then he would not have posted it  
here. and as you say "if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement  
does not help him. .. coz his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no  
choice." is because, thoughts have to die, Manonasham is this. Thoughts - you  
- 'I' need thoughts to survive.   
The very moment you read this post you have already put effort. Just Be is  
zero effort. zero thinking, where you can't see that you are not thinking for  
if you begin to see that you are not thinking, you have put an effort there.  
Just Be.

Nisargadatta Maharaj said that it is very important to watch "I-am-ness" all  
the time. I don't however understand what this sense "I Am" contains. Does it  
include seeing, smelling, hearing etc.? Should I be mindful of these also? Or  
is it enough if I just do like Maharshi said: "Get rid of your present  
thoughts, that is all."   
This however seems a little difficult (atleast when I'm not meditating). But  
would you say that just letting go of thinking is basically all that is  
necessary.

Dear Snow,   
Good question.   
It is the natural feeling of the sense of "I am" which Nisargadatta Maharaj is  
pointing to.   
This feeling is there even if we shut out our senses. For example: We can close our eyes and shut out the sense of vision. "I am" is still there.   
We can close our ears with our fingers and shut out the sense of hearing. "I

We can close our mouth and shut out the sense of taste. "I am" is still there.   
So what is this "I am" which seems to be independent of senses etc.   
How far can we go towards its source?   
Bhagavan Ramana says to find out, "from where this 'I' arises".   
In the process attention will go towards the pure consciousness within.   
Nisargadatta Maharaj says to remain with the sense of "I am" at its root (as  
far as possible) without allowing thoughts to extend "I am" as "I am this or  
that" (like "I am Henry", "I am a teacher", "I am feeling hot" etc.). The  
effect of this is also to take one towards the pure consciousness within.

Dear Snow,   
Good question.   
It is the natural feeling of the sense of "I am" which Nisargadatta Maharaj is  
pointing to.   
This feeling is there even if we shut out our senses. For example: We can close our eyes and shut out the sense of vision. "I am" is still there.   
We can close our ears with our fingers and shut out the sense of hearing. "I  
am" is still there.   
We can close our mouth and shut out the sense of taste. "I am" is still there.   
So what is this "I am" which seems to be independent of senses etc.   
How far can we go towards its source?   
Bhagavan Ramana says to find out, "from where this 'I' arises".   
In the process attention will go towards the pure consciousness within.   
Nisargadatta Maharaj says to remain with the sense of "I am" at its root (as  
far as possible) without allowing thoughts to extend "I am" as "I am this or  
that" (like "I am Henry", "I am a teacher", "I am feeling hot" etc.). The  
effect of this is also to take one towards the pure consciousness within.   
Thanks this is very helpful. =)

It is defintely not I am this or I am that.   
I AM is the state of Existence/Witness.   
Dear snow, it is ver difficult to remain in that I AM. That is why   
 **Bhagavan Ramana said: Ask for whom this thought? It is for me.   
Who am I? Keep on killing the soldiers coming out of the enemy   
fortress.  
It is difficult, so Bhagavan said Atma Vidya is very easy.   
It is because, we are carrying huge dirt of thoughts and vasanas,   
from many previous births. **Guru 's Grace alone will remove it one   
stroke, like the Sun removes the darkness of a room, closed and kept in  
darkness for years.   
Arunachala Siva.  
Is this one necessary to say? Isn't it pretty obivious? I find this not to be  
as powerful question to the mind than "Who am I" which is (like Adyashanti  
said) an alarm clock thrown in the dream.   
And can Bhagavan be my guru even though he left his body decades ago?

Dear snow,   
"I find this one as not powerful question..." \- I am not clear   
as to what this question, which is not powerful, that you refer.   
Kindly let me know.   
Should Bhagavan Ramana be only living in a body, to be our Guru?   
He remained in body for some years. One cannot live for ever in   
body. Further, why do you associate a body, for selecting a guru?   
Only those who are body conscious should worry about the guru being   
in body. Is not His Presence, powerful enough, to be your Guru?   
His Presence is all pervading but the power is felt at its highest   
in His Samadhi as well as in Old Hall, where He sat for 23 years   
and guided devotees. If you visit T'malai next time, kindly sit   
in the Samadhi Hall or Old Hall, for about an hour. You shall   
definitely feel the Power of Presence, engulfing you.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear snow,   
Yes. Letting go of all thoughts about the objective world - is   
the thoughtless state, that is essential for self enquiry. Thought   
about God within, Bhagavan Ramana says, Atma Nishtaparan, in   
Who am I? is the greatest devotion. Hence this thought should   
be retained till it matures into surrender. Once the total surrender   
becomes your nature, there is no need even for thought of God, since   
there is only God within you and not any more of you.   
The question, for whom this thought arises? is necessary and must   
be continued, till worldly thoughts keep bothering you. At one stage, for  
whom this thought arises? - will not arise at all. That   
is abidance in Self. If this abidance in Self becomes permanent,   
then it is Sahaja Stithi. Thereafter every worldly activity of yours   
will be done by That, as Ribhu Gita, Ch.26 Verse 25 states.   
Arunachala Siva.

What is the feeling of existing ? Seek within. What is the feeling on  
existing ? Now.   
Sometimes I call myself to find myself : Q : hello ? A : hmm ? Q: hello ?  
A:ar hmmm ? Q:hello ? A:... I am here ?   
But I am is coloured by the impressions/conditioning picked up. Holding the I  
am, deeper and deeper into the I am you go, beyond the impressions until there  
is just I am, and then one step further. .. which cannot be described.

Hmm okay, but I still have a tendency to make obsessions very easily so I  
think this would this form of enquiry would be more of a hindrance than an  
aid. And I've never read Nisargadatta recommending this question to asked.

Dear I,   
It takes a mammoth effort to do something, to think and it takes absolutely no  
effort at all to simply be. This is the greatest irony that 'mind' thinks  
other wise and never rests! This is the essence of 'I am'   
Just cast of the very need to understand this and simply be. do not attempt to  
know or even bother to answer your question, cast of your very question  
itself, relax and just be. You do not need to know anything about "I am" that  
is really being 'I am'

Dear Nagaraj,   
This. .. "Cast off everything and just be". .. when you say it, someone takes  
it into the mind. And then, its a memory.   
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
how to cast off everything and just be ?   
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
You tell me... you told this. .. just be. .. but do u really remain like that?  
The point is simple. .. anger just comes in a moment's time! IT wont give you  
time enough to refer to your memory and find "who am i sentence" and do it!   
Love!

Dear I,   
The moment you responded, you are not just being. You - 'I' \- Thoughts just  
don't want to be. see it wants to continue.   
Quote  
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
they don't come automatically, it comes because there is a need for all these  
emotions. To put it more clearly, these emotions arise because when any  
thought which arises and questions the very foundation of you - 'I' \- your  
thoughts, then it responds frantically, anger, fear, etc.. comes because it  
itself is under threat, its place is under question. hence these emotions  
arise.   
And at the same time, if any emotions such as comforting or happiness arises,  
it is nothing but anything that is conforming to what it already knows, it  
feels stronger, its place is assured, hence such emotions.   
emotions such as lust arise because of its inherent need of security to exist  
permanently. Lust need not necessarily be physical, money, material etc.. are  
all accumulated because of insecurity or incmpleteness.   
Quote  
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
If the person is already as you say Just Is, then he would not have posted it  
here. and as you say "if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement  
does not help him. .. coz his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no  
choice." is because, thoughts have to die, Manonasham is this. Thoughts - you  
- 'I' need thoughts to survive.   
The very moment you read this post you have already put effort. Just Be is  
zero effort. zero thinking, where you can't see that you are not thinking for  
if you begin to see that you are not thinking, you have put an effort there.  
Just Be.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

## How to watch the sense 'I am'

Nisargadatta Maharaj said that it is very important to watch "I-am-ness" all  
the time. I don't however understand what this sense "I Am" contains. Does it  
include seeing, smelling, hearing etc.? Should I be mindful of these also? Or  
is it enough if I just do like Maharshi said: "Get rid of your present  
thoughts, that is all."   
This however seems a little difficult (atleast when I'm not meditating). But  
would you say that just letting go of thinking is basically all that is  
necessary.

Dear Snow,   
Good question.   
It is the natural feeling of the sense of "I am" which Nisargadatta Maharaj is  
pointing to.   
This feeling is there even if we shut out our senses. For example: We can close our eyes and shut out the sense of vision. "I am" is still there.   
We can close our ears with our fingers and shut out the sense of hearing. "I  
am" is still there.   
We can close our mouth and shut out the sense of taste. "I am" is still there.   
So what is this "I am" which seems to be independent of senses etc.   
How far can we go towards its source?   
Bhagavan Ramana says to find out, "from where this 'I' arises".   
In the process attention will go towards the pure consciousness within.   
Nisargadatta Maharaj says to remain with the sense of "I am" at its root (as  
far as possible) without allowing thoughts to extend "I am" as "I am this or  
that" (like "I am Henry", "I am a teacher", "I am feeling hot" etc.). The  
effect of this is also to take one towards the pure consciousness within.

Is this one necessary to say? Isn't it pretty obivious? I find this not to be  
as powerful question to the mind than "Who am I" which is (like Adyashanti  
said) an alarm clock thrown in the dream.   
And can Bhagavan be my guru even though he left his body decades ago?

Dear snow,   
"I find this one as not powerful question..." \- I am not clear   
as to what this question, which is not powerful, that you refer.   
Kindly let me know.   
Should Bhagavan Ramana be only living in a body, to be our Guru?   
He remained in body for some years. One cannot live for ever in   
body. Further, why do you associate a body, for selecting a guru?   
Only those who are body conscious should worry about the guru being   
in body. Is not His Presence, powerful enough, to be your Guru?   
His Presence is all pervading but the power is felt at its highest   
in His Samadhi as well as in Old Hall, where He sat for 23 years   
and guided devotees. If you visit T'malai next time, kindly sit   
in the Samadhi Hall or Old Hall, for about an hour. You shall   
definitely feel the Power of Presence, engulfing you.   
Arunachala Siva.

I meant this part: "Bhagavan Ramana said: **Ask for whom this thought?** "   
And I asked earlier.

But would you say that just letting go of thinking is basically all that is

Is it?

Dear snow,   
Yes. Letting go of all thoughts about the objective world - is   
the thoughtless state, that is essential for self enquiry. Thought   
about God within, Bhagavan Ramana says, Atma Nishtaparan, in   
Who am I? is the greatest devotion. Hence this thought should   
be retained till it matures into surrender. Once the total surrender   
becomes your nature, there is no need even for thought of God, since   
there is only God within you and not any more of you.   
The question, for whom this thought arises? is necessary and must   
be continued, till worldly thoughts keep bothering you. At one stage, for  
whom this thought arises? - will not arise at all. That   
is abidance in Self. If this abidance in Self becomes permanent,   
then it is Sahaja Stithi. Thereafter every worldly activity of yours   
will be done by That, as Ribhu Gita, Ch.26 Verse 25 states.   
Arunachala Siva.

What is the feeling of existing ? Seek within. What is the feeling on  
existing ? Now.   
Sometimes I call myself to find myself : Q : hello ? A : hmm ? Q: hello ?  
A:ar hmmm ? Q:hello ? A:... I am here ?   
But I am is coloured by the impressions/conditioning picked up. Holding the I  
am, deeper and deeper into the I am you go, beyond the impressions until there  
is just I am, and then one step further. .. which cannot be described.

Dear I,   
It takes a mammoth effort to do something, to think and it takes absolutely no  
effort at all to simply be. This is the greatest irony that 'mind' thinks  
other wise and never rests! This is the essence of 'I am'   
Just cast of the very need to understand this and simply be. do not attempt to  
know or even bother to answer your question, cast of your very question  
itself, relax and just be. You do not need to know anything about "I am" that  
is really being 'I am'

Dear Nagaraj,   
This. .. "Cast off everything and just be". .. when you say it, someone takes  
it into the mind. And then, its a memory.   
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
how to cast off everything and just be ?   
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
You tell me... you told this. .. just be. .. but do u really remain like that?  
The point is simple. .. anger just comes in a moment's time! IT wont give you  
time enough to refer to your memory and find "who am i sentence" and do it!   
Love!

Dear I,   
The moment you responded, you are not just being. You - 'I' \- Thoughts just  
don't want to be. see it wants to continue.   
Quote  
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
they don't come automatically, it comes because there is a need for all these  
emotions. To put it more clearly, these emotions arise because when any  
thought which arises and questions the very foundation of you - 'I' \- your  
thoughts, then it responds frantically, anger, fear, etc.. comes because it  
itself is under threat, its place is under question. hence these emotions  
arise.   
And at the same time, if any emotions such as comforting or happiness arises,  
it is nothing but anything that is conforming to what it already knows, it  
feels stronger, its place is assured, hence such emotions.   
emotions such as lust arise because of its inherent need of security to exist  
permanently. Lust need not necessarily be physical, money, material etc.. are  
all accumulated because of insecurity or incmpleteness.   
Quote  
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
If the person is already as you say Just Is, then he would not have posted it  
here. and as you say "if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement  
does not help him. .. coz his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no  
choice." is because, thoughts have to die, Manonasham is this. Thoughts - you  
- 'I' need thoughts to survive.   
The very moment you read this post you have already put effort. Just Be is  
zero effort. zero thinking, where you can't see that you are not thinking for  
if you begin to see that you are not thinking, you have put an effort there.  
Just Be.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

## How to watch the sense 'I am'

Nisargadatta Maharaj said that it is very important to watch "I-am-ness" all  
the time. I don't however understand what this sense "I Am" contains. Does it  
include seeing, smelling, hearing etc.? Should I be mindful of these also? Or  
is it enough if I just do like Maharshi said: "Get rid of your present  
thoughts, that is all."   
This however seems a little difficult (atleast when I'm not meditating). But  
would you say that just letting go of thinking is basically all that is  
necessary.

Dear Snow,   
Good question.   
It is the natural feeling of the sense of "I am" which Nisargadatta Maharaj is  
pointing to.   
This feeling is there even if we shut out our senses. For example: We can close our eyes and shut out the sense of vision. "I am" is still there.   
We can close our ears with our fingers and shut out the sense of hearing. "I  
am" is still there.   
We can close our mouth and shut out the sense of taste. "I am" is still there.   
So what is this "I am" which seems to be independent of senses etc.   
How far can we go towards its source?   
Bhagavan Ramana says to find out, "from where this 'I' arises".   
In the process attention will go towards the pure consciousness within.   
Nisargadatta Maharaj says to remain with the sense of "I am" at its root (as  
far as possible) without allowing thoughts to extend "I am" as "I am this or  
that" (like "I am Henry", "I am a teacher", "I am feeling hot" etc.). The  
effect of this is also to take one towards the pure consciousness within.

The state of I AM is simply I AM.   
It is defintely not I am this or I am that.   
I AM is the state of Existence/Witness.   
Dear snow, it is ver difficult to remain in that I AM. That is why   
Bhagavan Ramana said: Ask for whom this thought? It is for me.   
Who am I? Keep on killing the soldiers coming out of the enemy   
fortress. It is difficult, so Bhagavan said Atma Vidya is very easy.   
It is because, we are carrying huge dirt of thoughts and vasanas,   
from many previous births. Guru's Grace alone will remove it one

Dear snow,   
"I find this one as not powerful question..." \- I am not clear   
as to what this question, which is not powerful, that you refer.   
Kindly let me know.   
Should Bhagavan Ramana be only living in a body, to be our Guru?   
He remained in body for some years. One cannot live for ever in   
body. Further, why do you associate a body, for selecting a guru?   
Only those who are body conscious should worry about the guru being   
in body. Is not His Presence, powerful enough, to be your Guru?   
His Presence is all pervading but the power is felt at its highest   
in His Samadhi as well as in Old Hall, where He sat for 23 years   
and guided devotees. If you visit T'malai next time, kindly sit   
in the Samadhi Hall or Old Hall, for about an hour. You shall   
definitely feel the Power of Presence, engulfing you.

Dear snow,   
"I find this one as not powerful question..." \- I am not clear   
as to what this question, which is not powerful, that you refer.   
Kindly let me know.   
Should Bhagavan Ramana be only living in a body, to be our Guru?   
He remained in body for some years. One cannot live for ever in   
body. Further, why do you associate a body, for selecting a guru?   
Only those who are body conscious should worry about the guru being   
in body. Is not His Presence, powerful enough, to be your Guru?   
His Presence is all pervading but the power is felt at its highest   
in His Samadhi as well as in Old Hall, where He sat for 23 years   
and guided devotees. If you visit T'malai next time, kindly sit   
in the Samadhi Hall or Old Hall, for about an hour. You shall   
definitely feel the Power of Presence, engulfing you.   
Arunachala Siva.   
Thanks   
I meant this part: "Bhagavan Ramana said: **Ask for whom this thought?** "   
And I asked earlier.   
Quote  
But would you say that just letting go of thinking is basically all that is  
necessary.  
Is it?

Dear snow,   
Yes. Letting go of all thoughts about the objective world - is   
the thoughtless state, that is essential for self enquiry. Thought   
about God within, Bhagavan Ramana says, Atma Nishtaparan, in   
Who am I? is the greatest devotion. Hence this thought should   
be retained till it matures into surrender. Once the total surrender   
becomes your nature, there is no need even for thought of God, since   
there is only God within you and not any more of you.   
The question, for whom this thought arises? is necessary and must   
be continued, till worldly thoughts keep bothering you. At one stage, for  
whom this thought arises? - will not arise at all. That   
is abidance in Self. If this abidance in Self becomes permanent,   
then it is Sahaja Stithi. Thereafter every worldly activity of yours   
will be done by That, as Ribhu Gita, Ch.26 Verse 25 states.   
Arunachala Siva.

What is the feeling of existing ? Seek within. What is the feeling on  
existing ? Now.   
Sometimes I call myself to find myself : Q : hello ? A : hmm ? Q: hello ?  
A:ar hmmm ? Q:hello ? A:... I am here ?   
But I am is coloured by the impressions/conditioning picked up. Holding the I  
am, deeper and deeper into the I am you go, beyond the impressions until there  
is just I am, and then one step further. .. which cannot be described.

Dear I,   
It takes a mammoth effort to do something, to think and it takes absolutely no  
effort at all to simply be. This is the greatest irony that 'mind' thinks  
other wise and never rests! This is the essence of 'I am'   
Just cast of the very need to understand this and simply be. do not attempt to  
know or even bother to answer your question, cast of your very question  
itself, relax and just be. You do not need to know anything about "I am" that  
is really being 'I am'   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
This. .. "Cast off everything and just be". .. when you say it, someone takes  
it into the mind. And then, its a memory.   
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
how to cast off everything and just be ?   
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
You tell me... you told this. .. just be. .. but do u really remain like that?  
The point is simple. .. anger just comes in a moment's time! IT wont give you  
time enough to refer to your memory and find "who am i sentence" and do it!   
Love!

Dear I,   
The moment you responded, you are not just being. You - 'I' \- Thoughts just  
don't want to be. see it wants to continue.   
Quote  
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
they don't come automatically, it comes because there is a need for all these  
emotions. To put it more clearly, these emotions arise because when any  
thought which arises and questions the very foundation of you - 'I' \- your  
thoughts, then it responds frantically, anger, fear, etc.. comes because it  
itself is under threat, its place is under question. hence these emotions  
arise.   
And at the same time, if any emotions such as comforting or happiness arises,  
it is nothing but anything that is conforming to what it already knows, it  
feels stronger, its place is assured, hence such emotions.   
emotions such as lust arise because of its inherent need of security to exist  
permanently. Lust need not necessarily be physical, money, material etc.. are  
all accumulated because of insecurity or incmpleteness.   
Quote  
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
If the person is already as you say Just Is, then he would not have posted it  
here. and as you say "if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement  
does not help him. .. coz his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no  
choice." is because, thoughts have to die, Manonasham is this. Thoughts - you  
- 'I' need thoughts to survive.   
The very moment you read this post you have already put effort. Just Be is  
zero effort. zero thinking, where you can't see that you are not thinking for  
if you begin to see that you are not thinking, you have put an effort there.  
Just Be.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

## How to watch the sense 'I am'  
Author: snow                Date: January 07, 2010, 03:06:33 PM

Nisargadatta Maharaj said that it is very important to watch "I-am-ness" all  
the time. I don't however understand what this sense "I Am" contains. Does it  
include seeing, smelling, hearing etc.? Should I be mindful of these also? Or  
is it enough if I just do like Maharshi said: "Get rid of your present  
thoughts, that is all."   
This however seems a little difficult (atleast when I'm not meditating). But  
would you say that just letting go of thinking is basically all that is  
necessary.

Dear Snow,   
Good question.   
It is the natural feeling of the sense of "I am" which Nisargadatta Maharaj is  
pointing to.   
This feeling is there even if we shut out our senses. For example: We can close our eyes and shut out the sense of vision. "I am" is still there.   
We can close our ears with our fingers and shut out the sense of hearing. "I  
am" is still there.   
We can close our mouth and shut out the sense of taste. "I am" is still there.   
So what is this "I am" which seems to be independent of senses etc.   
How far can we go towards its source?   
Bhagavan Ramana says to find out, "from where this 'I' arises".   
In the process attention will go towards the pure consciousness within.   
Nisargadatta Maharaj says to remain with the sense of "I am" at its root (as  
far as possible) without allowing thoughts to extend "I am" as "I am this or  
that" (like "I am Henry", "I am a teacher", "I am feeling hot" etc.). The  
effect of this is also to take one towards the pure consciousness within.

The state of I AM is simply I AM.   
It is defintely not I am this or I am that.   
I AM is the state of Existence/Witness.   
Dear snow, it is ver difficult to remain in that I AM. That is why   
Bhagavan Ramana said: Ask for whom this thought? It is for me.   
Who am I? Keep on killing the soldiers coming out of the enemy   
fortress. It is difficult, so Bhagavan said Atma Vidya is very easy.   
It is because, we are carrying huge dirt of thoughts and vasanas,   
from many previous births. Guru's Grace alone will remove it one

darkness for years.

Is this one necessary to say? Isn't it pretty obivious? I find this not to be  
as powerful question to the mind than "Who am I" which is (like Adyashanti

And can Bhagavan be my guru even though he left his body decades ago?

Dear snow,   
"I find this one as not powerful question..." \- I am not clear   
as to what this question, which is not powerful, that you refer.   
Kindly let me know.   
Should Bhagavan Ramana be only living in a body, to be our Guru?   
He remained in body for some years. One cannot live for ever in   
body. Further, why do you associate a body, for selecting a guru?   
Only those who are body conscious should worry about the guru being   
in body. Is not His Presence, powerful enough, to be your Guru?   
His Presence is all pervading but the power is felt at its highest   
in His Samadhi as well as in Old Hall, where He sat for 23 years   
and guided devotees. If you visit T'malai next time, kindly sit   
in the Samadhi Hall or Old Hall, for about an hour. You shall   
definitely feel the Power of Presence, engulfing you.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear snow,   
Yes. Letting go of all thoughts about the objective world - is   
the thoughtless state, that is essential for self enquiry. Thought   
about God within, Bhagavan Ramana says, Atma Nishtaparan, in   
Who am I? is the greatest devotion. Hence this thought should   
be retained till it matures into surrender. Once the total surrender   
becomes your nature, there is no need even for thought of God, since   
there is only God within you and not any more of you.   
The question, for whom this thought arises? is necessary and must   
be continued, till worldly thoughts keep bothering you. At one stage, for  
whom this thought arises? - will not arise at all. That   
is abidance in Self. If this abidance in Self becomes permanent,   
then it is Sahaja Stithi. Thereafter every worldly activity of yours   
will be done by That, as Ribhu Gita, Ch.26 Verse 25 states.   
Arunachala Siva.

What is the feeling of existing ? Seek within. What is the feeling on  
existing ? Now.   
Sometimes I call myself to find myself : Q : hello ? A : hmm ? Q: hello ?  
A:ar hmmm ? Q:hello ? A:... I am here ?   
But I am is coloured by the impressions/conditioning picked up. Holding the I  
am, deeper and deeper into the I am you go, beyond the impressions until there  
is just I am, and then one step further. .. which cannot be described.

Dear I,   
It takes a mammoth effort to do something, to think and it takes absolutely no  
effort at all to simply be. This is the greatest irony that 'mind' thinks  
other wise and never rests! This is the essence of 'I am'   
Just cast of the very need to understand this and simply be. do not attempt to  
know or even bother to answer your question, cast of your very question  
itself, relax and just be. You do not need to know anything about "I am" that  
is really being 'I am'   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
This. .. "Cast off everything and just be". .. when you say it, someone takes  
it into the mind. And then, its a memory.   
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
how to cast off everything and just be ?   
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
You tell me... you told this. .. just be. .. but do u really remain like that?  
The point is simple. .. anger just comes in a moment's time! IT wont give you  
time enough to refer to your memory and find "who am i sentence" and do it!   
Love!

Dear I,   
The moment you responded, you are not just being. You - 'I' \- Thoughts just  
don't want to be. see it wants to continue.   
Quote  
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
they don't come automatically, it comes because there is a need for all these  
emotions. To put it more clearly, these emotions arise because when any  
thought which arises and questions the very foundation of you - 'I' \- your  
thoughts, then it responds frantically, anger, fear, etc.. comes because it  
itself is under threat, its place is under question. hence these emotions  
arise.   
And at the same time, if any emotions such as comforting or happiness arises,  
it is nothing but anything that is conforming to what it already knows, it  
feels stronger, its place is assured, hence such emotions.   
emotions such as lust arise because of its inherent need of security to exist  
permanently. Lust need not necessarily be physical, money, material etc.. are  
all accumulated because of insecurity or incmpleteness.   
Quote  
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
If the person is already as you say Just Is, then he would not have posted it  
here. and as you say "if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement  
does not help him. .. coz his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no  
choice." is because, thoughts have to die, Manonasham is this. Thoughts - you  
- 'I' need thoughts to survive.   
The very moment you read this post you have already put effort. Just Be is  
zero effort. zero thinking, where you can't see that you are not thinking for  
if you begin to see that you are not thinking, you have put an effort there.  
Just Be.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

## How to watch the sense 'I am'  
Author: snow                Date: January 07, 2010, 03:06:33 PM  
---  
Nisargadatta Maharaj said that it is very important to watch "I-am-ness" all  
the time. I don't however understand what this sense "I Am" contains. Does it  
include seeing, smelling, hearing etc.? Should I be mindful of these also? Or  
is it enough if I just do like Maharshi said: "Get rid of your present  
thoughts, that is all."   
This however seems a little difficult (atleast when I'm not meditating). But  
would you say that just letting go of thinking is basically all that is  
necessary.

Dear Snow,   
Good question.   
It is the natural feeling of the sense of "I am" which Nisargadatta Maharaj is  
pointing to.   
This feeling is there even if we shut out our senses. For example: We can close our eyes and shut out the sense of vision. "I am" is still there.   
We can close our ears with our fingers and shut out the sense of hearing. "I  
am" is still there.   
We can close our mouth and shut out the sense of taste. "I am" is still there.   
So what is this "I am" which seems to be independent of senses etc.   
How far can we go towards its source?   
Bhagavan Ramana says to find out, "from where this 'I' arises".   
In the process attention will go towards the pure consciousness within.   
Nisargadatta Maharaj says to remain with the sense of "I am" at its root (as  
far as possible) without allowing thoughts to extend "I am" as "I am this or  
that" (like "I am Henry", "I am a teacher", "I am feeling hot" etc.). The  
effect of this is also to take one towards the pure consciousness within.

The state of I AM is simply I AM.   
It is defintely not I am this or I am that.   
I AM is the state of Existence/Witness.   
Dear snow, it is ver difficult to remain in that I AM. That is why   
Bhagavan Ramana said: Ask for whom this thought? It is for me.   
Who am I? Keep on killing the soldiers coming out of the enemy   
fortress. It is difficult, so Bhagavan said Atma Vidya is very easy.   
It is because, we are carrying huge dirt of thoughts and vasanas,   
from many previous births. Guru's Grace alone will remove it one

as powerful question to the mind than "Who am I" which is (like Adyashanti

And can Bhagavan be my guru even though he left his body decades ago?

Dear snow,   
"I find this one as not powerful question..." \- I am not clear   
as to what this question, which is not powerful, that you refer.   
Kindly let me know.   
Should Bhagavan Ramana be only living in a body, to be our Guru?   
He remained in body for some years. One cannot live for ever in   
body. Further, why do you associate a body, for selecting a guru?   
Only those who are body conscious should worry about the guru being   
in body. Is not His Presence, powerful enough, to be your Guru?   
His Presence is all pervading but the power is felt at its highest   
in His Samadhi as well as in Old Hall, where He sat for 23 years   
and guided devotees. If you visit T'malai next time, kindly sit   
in the Samadhi Hall or Old Hall, for about an hour. You shall   
definitely feel the Power of Presence, engulfing you.   
Arunachala Siva.

What is the feeling of existing ? Seek within. What is the feeling on  
existing ? Now.   
Sometimes I call myself to find myself : Q : hello ? A : hmm ? Q: hello ?  
A:ar hmmm ? Q:hello ? A:... I am here ?   
But I am is coloured by the impressions/conditioning picked up. Holding the I  
am, deeper and deeper into the I am you go, beyond the impressions until there  
is just I am, and then one step further. .. which cannot be described.

dear snow I would like to anwer your first questions..   
the sense of "Iam" is effortless, so making effort to reach it is  
impossible..you can try but hte more oyu try the more you will be hard in the  
chest, the energy will move to your head and you will find meditaitng is very  
exhausting...   
this is a misstake that I do and others do...so maybe this could save some  
time   
noone has ever seen this "Iam"...it is not an object to meditate about, infact  
the more we try to reach it the more we are in ignorance of our true nature   
warding of thoughts cna be missunderstood, beeing thougtless is nice but  
temporary what we look for is ever present conciousness...wich does not care  
aout our thoughts...so best thing is to be that wich does not care wether  
thoughts are there or not...

Dear I,   
It takes a mammoth effort to do something, to think and it takes absolutely no  
effort at all to simply be. This is the greatest irony that 'mind' thinks  
other wise and never rests! This is the essence of 'I am'   
Just cast of the very need to understand this and simply be. do not attempt to  
know or even bother to answer your question, cast of your very question  
itself, relax and just be. You do not need to know anything about "I am" that  
is really being 'I am'

Dear Nagaraj,   
This. .. "Cast off everything and just be". .. when you say it, someone takes  
it into the mind. And then, its a memory.   
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
how to cast off everything and just be ?   
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
You tell me... you told this. .. just be. .. but do u really remain like that?  
The point is simple. .. anger just comes in a moment's time! IT wont give you  
time enough to refer to your memory and find "who am i sentence" and do it!   
Love!

Dear I,   
The moment you responded, you are not just being. You - 'I' \- Thoughts just  
don't want to be. see it wants to continue.   
Quote  
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
they don't come automatically, it comes because there is a need for all these  
emotions. To put it more clearly, these emotions arise because when any  
thought which arises and questions the very foundation of you - 'I' \- your  
thoughts, then it responds frantically, anger, fear, etc.. comes because it  
itself is under threat, its place is under question. hence these emotions  
arise.   
And at the same time, if any emotions such as comforting or happiness arises,  
it is nothing but anything that is conforming to what it already knows, it  
feels stronger, its place is assured, hence such emotions.   
emotions such as lust arise because of its inherent need of security to exist  
permanently. Lust need not necessarily be physical, money, material etc.. are  
all accumulated because of insecurity or incmpleteness.   
Quote  
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
If the person is already as you say Just Is, then he would not have posted it  
here. and as you say "if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement  
does not help him. .. coz his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no  
choice." is because, thoughts have to die, Manonasham is this. Thoughts - you  
- 'I' need thoughts to survive.   
The very moment you read this post you have already put effort. Just Be is  
zero effort. zero thinking, where you can't see that you are not thinking for  
if you begin to see that you are not thinking, you have put an effort there.  
Just Be.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

## How to watch the sense 'I am'  
Author: snow                Date: January 07, 2010, 03:06:33 PM  
---  
Nisargadatta Maharaj said that it is very important to watch "I-am-ness" all  
the time. I don't however understand what this sense "I Am" contains. Does it  
include seeing, smelling, hearing etc.? Should I be mindful of these also? Or  
is it enough if I just do like Maharshi said: "Get rid of your present  
thoughts, that is all."   
This however seems a little difficult (atleast when I'm not meditating). But  
would you say that just letting go of thinking is basically all that is  
necessary.

Dear Snow,   
Good question.   
It is the natural feeling of the sense of "I am" which Nisargadatta Maharaj is  
pointing to.   
This feeling is there even if we shut out our senses. For example: We can close our eyes and shut out the sense of vision. "I am" is still there.   
We can close our ears with our fingers and shut out the sense of hearing. "I  
am" is still there.   
We can close our mouth and shut out the sense of taste. "I am" is still there.   
So what is this "I am" which seems to be independent of senses etc.   
How far can we go towards its source?   
Bhagavan Ramana says to find out, "from where this 'I' arises".   
In the process attention will go towards the pure consciousness within.   
Nisargadatta Maharaj says to remain with the sense of "I am" at its root (as  
far as possible) without allowing thoughts to extend "I am" as "I am this or  
that" (like "I am Henry", "I am a teacher", "I am feeling hot" etc.). The  
effect of this is also to take one towards the pure consciousness within.

The state of I AM is simply I AM.   
It is defintely not I am this or I am that.   
I AM is the state of Existence/Witness.   
Dear snow, it is ver difficult to remain in that I AM. That is why   
Bhagavan Ramana said: Ask for whom this thought? It is for me.   
Who am I? Keep on killing the soldiers coming out of the enemy   
fortress. It is difficult, so Bhagavan said Atma Vidya is very easy.   
It is because, we are carrying huge dirt of thoughts and vasanas,   
from many previous births. Guru's Grace alone will remove it one   
stroke, like the Sun removes the darkness of a room, closed and kept in  
darkness for years.

Is this one necessary to say? Isn't it pretty obivious? I find this not to be  
as powerful question to the mind than "Who am I" which is (like Adyashanti  
said) an alarm clock thrown in the dream.   
And can Bhagavan be my guru even though he left his body decades ago?

Dear snow,   
"I find this one as not powerful question..." \- I am not clear   
as to what this question, which is not powerful, that you refer.   
Kindly let me know.   
Should Bhagavan Ramana be only living in a body, to be our Guru?   
He remained in body for some years. One cannot live for ever in   
body. Further, why do you associate a body, for selecting a guru?   
Only those who are body conscious should worry about the guru being   
in body. Is not His Presence, powerful enough, to be your Guru?   
His Presence is all pervading but the power is felt at its highest   
in His Samadhi as well as in Old Hall, where He sat for 23 years   
and guided devotees. If you visit T'malai next time, kindly sit   
in the Samadhi Hall or Old Hall, for about an hour. You shall   
definitely feel the Power of Presence, engulfing you.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear snow,   
Yes. Letting go of all thoughts about the objective world - is   
the thoughtless state, that is essential for self enquiry. Thought   
about God within, Bhagavan Ramana says, Atma Nishtaparan, in   
Who am I? is the greatest devotion. Hence this thought should   
be retained till it matures into surrender. Once the total surrender   
becomes your nature, there is no need even for thought of God, since   
there is only God within you and not any more of you.   
The question, for whom this thought arises? is necessary and must   
be continued, till worldly thoughts keep bothering you. At one stage, for  
whom this thought arises? - will not arise at all. That   
is abidance in Self. If this abidance in Self becomes permanent,   
then it is Sahaja Stithi. Thereafter every worldly activity of yours   
will be done by That, as Ribhu Gita, Ch.26 Verse 25 states.

dear snow I would like to anwer your first questions..   
the sense of "Iam" is effortless, so making effort to reach it is  
impossible..you can try but hte more oyu try the more you will be hard in the  
chest, the energy will move to your head and you will find meditaitng is very  
exhausting...   
this is a misstake that I do and others do...so maybe this could save some  
time   
noone has ever seen this "Iam"...it is not an object to meditate about, infact  
the more we try to reach it the more we are in ignorance of our true nature   
warding of thoughts cna be missunderstood, beeing thougtless is nice but  
temporary what we look for is ever present conciousness...wich does not care  
aout our thoughts...so best thing is to be that wich does not care wether  
thoughts are there or not...   
hope I could be of help

Dear I,   
It takes a mammoth effort to do something, to think and it takes absolutely no  
effort at all to simply be. This is the greatest irony that 'mind' thinks  
other wise and never rests! This is the essence of 'I am'   
Just cast of the very need to understand this and simply be. do not attempt to  
know or even bother to answer your question, cast of your very question  
itself, relax and just be. You do not need to know anything about "I am" that  
is really being 'I am'

Dear Nagaraj,   
This. .. "Cast off everything and just be". .. when you say it, someone takes  
it into the mind. And then, its a memory.   
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
how to cast off everything and just be ?   
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
You tell me... you told this. .. just be. .. but do u really remain like that?  
The point is simple. .. anger just comes in a moment's time! IT wont give you  
time enough to refer to your memory and find "who am i sentence" and do it!   
Love!

Dear I,   
The moment you responded, you are not just being. You - 'I' \- Thoughts just  
don't want to be. see it wants to continue.   
Quote  
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
they don't come automatically, it comes because there is a need for all these  
emotions. To put it more clearly, these emotions arise because when any  
thought which arises and questions the very foundation of you - 'I' \- your  
thoughts, then it responds frantically, anger, fear, etc.. comes because it  
itself is under threat, its place is under question. hence these emotions  
arise.   
And at the same time, if any emotions such as comforting or happiness arises,  
it is nothing but anything that is conforming to what it already knows, it  
feels stronger, its place is assured, hence such emotions.   
emotions such as lust arise because of its inherent need of security to exist  
permanently. Lust need not necessarily be physical, money, material etc.. are  
all accumulated because of insecurity or incmpleteness.   
Quote  
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
If the person is already as you say Just Is, then he would not have posted it  
here. and as you say "if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement  
does not help him. .. coz his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no  
choice." is because, thoughts have to die, Manonasham is this. Thoughts - you  
- 'I' need thoughts to survive.   
The very moment you read this post you have already put effort. Just Be is  
zero effort. zero thinking, where you can't see that you are not thinking for  
if you begin to see that you are not thinking, you have put an effort there.  
Just Be.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

## How to watch the sense 'I am'  
Author: snow                Date: January 07, 2010, 03:06:33 PM  
---  
Nisargadatta Maharaj said that it is very important to watch "I-am-ness" all  
the time. I don't however understand what this sense "I Am" contains. Does it  
include seeing, smelling, hearing etc.? Should I be mindful of these also? Or  
is it enough if I just do like Maharshi said: "Get rid of your present  
thoughts, that is all."   
This however seems a little difficult (atleast when I'm not meditating). But  
would you say that just letting go of thinking is basically all that is  
necessary.

Dear Snow,   
Good question.   
It is the natural feeling of the sense of "I am" which Nisargadatta Maharaj is  
pointing to.   
This feeling is there even if we shut out our senses. For example: We can close our eyes and shut out the sense of vision. "I am" is still there.   
We can close our ears with our fingers and shut out the sense of hearing. "I  
am" is still there.   
We can close our mouth and shut out the sense of taste. "I am" is still there.   
So what is this "I am" which seems to be independent of senses etc.   
How far can we go towards its source?   
Bhagavan Ramana says to find out, "from where this 'I' arises".   
In the process attention will go towards the pure consciousness within.   
Nisargadatta Maharaj says to remain with the sense of "I am" at its root (as  
far as possible) without allowing thoughts to extend "I am" as "I am this or  
that" (like "I am Henry", "I am a teacher", "I am feeling hot" etc.). The  
effect of this is also to take one towards the pure consciousness within.

The state of I AM is simply I AM.   
It is defintely not I am this or I am that.   
I AM is the state of Existence/Witness.   
Dear snow, it is ver difficult to remain in that I AM. That is why   
Bhagavan Ramana said: Ask for whom this thought? It is for me.   
Who am I? Keep on killing the soldiers coming out of the enemy   
fortress. It is difficult, so Bhagavan said Atma Vidya is very easy.   
It is because, we are carrying huge dirt of thoughts and vasanas,   
from many previous births. Guru's Grace alone will remove it one   
stroke, like the Sun removes the darkness of a room, closed and kept in  
darkness for years.

Is this one necessary to say? Isn't it pretty obivious? I find this not to be  
as powerful question to the mind than "Who am I" which is (like Adyashanti  
said) an alarm clock thrown in the dream.   
And can Bhagavan be my guru even though he left his body decades ago?

Dear snow,   
"I find this one as not powerful question..." \- I am not clear   
as to what this question, which is not powerful, that you refer.   
Kindly let me know.   
Should Bhagavan Ramana be only living in a body, to be our Guru?   
He remained in body for some years. One cannot live for ever in   
body. Further, why do you associate a body, for selecting a guru?   
Only those who are body conscious should worry about the guru being   
in body. Is not His Presence, powerful enough, to be your Guru?   
His Presence is all pervading but the power is felt at its highest   
in His Samadhi as well as in Old Hall, where He sat for 23 years   
and guided devotees. If you visit T'malai next time, kindly sit   
in the Samadhi Hall or Old Hall, for about an hour. You shall   
definitely feel the Power of Presence, engulfing you.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear snow,   
Yes. Letting go of all thoughts about the objective world - is   
the thoughtless state, that is essential for self enquiry. Thought   
about God within, Bhagavan Ramana says, Atma Nishtaparan, in   
Who am I? is the greatest devotion. Hence this thought should   
be retained till it matures into surrender. Once the total surrender   
becomes your nature, there is no need even for thought of God, since   
there is only God within you and not any more of you.   
The question, for whom this thought arises? is necessary and must   
be continued, till worldly thoughts keep bothering you. At one stage, for  
whom this thought arises? - will not arise at all. That   
is abidance in Self. If this abidance in Self becomes permanent,   
then it is Sahaja Stithi. Thereafter every worldly activity of yours   
will be done by That, as Ribhu Gita, Ch.26 Verse 25 states.   
Arunachala Siva.

What is the feeling of existing ? Seek within. What is the feeling on  
existing ? Now.   
Sometimes I call myself to find myself : Q : hello ? A : hmm ? Q: hello ?  
A:ar hmmm ? Q:hello ? A:... I am here ?   
But I am is coloured by the impressions/conditioning picked up. Holding the I  
am, deeper and deeper into the I am you go, beyond the impressions until there  
is just I am, and then one step further. .. which cannot be described.

Hmm okay, but I still have a tendency to make obsessions very easily so I  
think this would this form of enquiry would be more of a hindrance than an  
aid. And I've never read Nisargadatta recommending this question to asked.

Dear I,   
It takes a mammoth effort to do something, to think and it takes absolutely no  
effort at all to simply be. This is the greatest irony that 'mind' thinks  
other wise and never rests! This is the essence of 'I am'   
Just cast of the very need to understand this and simply be. do not attempt to  
know or even bother to answer your question, cast of your very question  
itself, relax and just be. You do not need to know anything about "I am" that  
is really being 'I am'   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
This. .. "Cast off everything and just be". .. when you say it, someone takes  
it into the mind. And then, its a memory.   
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
how to cast off everything and just be ?   
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
You tell me... you told this. .. just be. .. but do u really remain like that?  
The point is simple. .. anger just comes in a moment's time! IT wont give you  
time enough to refer to your memory and find "who am i sentence" and do it!   
Love!   
Silence

Dear I,   
The moment you responded, you are not just being. You - 'I' \- Thoughts just  
don't want to be. see it wants to continue.   
Quote  
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
they don't come automatically, it comes because there is a need for all these  
emotions. To put it more clearly, these emotions arise because when any  
thought which arises and questions the very foundation of you - 'I' \- your  
thoughts, then it responds frantically, anger, fear, etc.. comes because it  
itself is under threat, its place is under question. hence these emotions  
arise.   
And at the same time, if any emotions such as comforting or happiness arises,  
it is nothing but anything that is conforming to what it already knows, it  
feels stronger, its place is assured, hence such emotions.   
emotions such as lust arise because of its inherent need of security to exist  
permanently. Lust need not necessarily be physical, money, material etc.. are  
all accumulated because of insecurity or incmpleteness.   
Quote  
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
If the person is already as you say Just Is, then he would not have posted it  
here. and as you say "if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement  
does not help him. .. coz his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no  
choice." is because, thoughts have to die, Manonasham is this. Thoughts - you  
- 'I' need thoughts to survive.   
The very moment you read this post you have already put effort. Just Be is  
zero effort. zero thinking, where you can't see that you are not thinking for  
if you begin to see that you are not thinking, you have put an effort there.  
Just Be.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

## How to watch the sense 'I am'  
Author: snow                Date: January 07, 2010, 03:06:33 PM  
---  
Nisargadatta Maharaj said that it is very important to watch "I-am-ness" all  
the time. I don't however understand what this sense "I Am" contains. Does it  
include seeing, smelling, hearing etc.? Should I be mindful of these also? Or  
is it enough if I just do like Maharshi said: "Get rid of your present  
thoughts, that is all."   
This however seems a little difficult (atleast when I'm not meditating). But  
would you say that just letting go of thinking is basically all that is  
necessary.

Dear Snow,   
Good question.   
It is the natural feeling of the sense of "I am" which Nisargadatta Maharaj is  
pointing to.   
This feeling is there even if we shut out our senses. For example: We can close our eyes and shut out the sense of vision. "I am" is still there.   
We can close our ears with our fingers and shut out the sense of hearing. "I  
am" is still there.   
We can close our mouth and shut out the sense of taste. "I am" is still there.   
So what is this "I am" which seems to be independent of senses etc.   
How far can we go towards its source?   
Bhagavan Ramana says to find out, "from where this 'I' arises".   
In the process attention will go towards the pure consciousness within.   
Nisargadatta Maharaj says to remain with the sense of "I am" at its root (as  
far as possible) without allowing thoughts to extend "I am" as "I am this or  
that" (like "I am Henry", "I am a teacher", "I am feeling hot" etc.). The  
effect of this is also to take one towards the pure consciousness within.

The state of I AM is simply I AM.   
It is defintely not I am this or I am that.   
I AM is the state of Existence/Witness.   
Dear snow, it is ver difficult to remain in that I AM. That is why   
Bhagavan Ramana said: Ask for whom this thought? It is for me.   
Who am I? Keep on killing the soldiers coming out of the enemy   
fortress. It is difficult, so Bhagavan said Atma Vidya is very easy.   
It is because, we are carrying huge dirt of thoughts and vasanas,   
from many previous births. Guru's Grace alone will remove it one   
stroke, like the Sun removes the darkness of a room, closed and kept in  
darkness for years.

Is this one necessary to say? Isn't it pretty obivious? I find this not to be  
as powerful question to the mind than "Who am I" which is (like Adyashanti  
said) an alarm clock thrown in the dream.   
And can Bhagavan be my guru even though he left his body decades ago?

Dear snow,   
"I find this one as not powerful question..." \- I am not clear   
as to what this question, which is not powerful, that you refer.   
Kindly let me know.   
Should Bhagavan Ramana be only living in a body, to be our Guru?   
He remained in body for some years. One cannot live for ever in   
body. Further, why do you associate a body, for selecting a guru?   
Only those who are body conscious should worry about the guru being   
in body. Is not His Presence, powerful enough, to be your Guru?   
His Presence is all pervading but the power is felt at its highest   
in His Samadhi as well as in Old Hall, where He sat for 23 years   
and guided devotees. If you visit T'malai next time, kindly sit   
in the Samadhi Hall or Old Hall, for about an hour. You shall   
definitely feel the Power of Presence, engulfing you.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear snow,   
Yes. Letting go of all thoughts about the objective world - is   
the thoughtless state, that is essential for self enquiry. Thought   
about God within, Bhagavan Ramana says, Atma Nishtaparan, in   
Who am I? is the greatest devotion. Hence this thought should   
be retained till it matures into surrender. Once the total surrender   
becomes your nature, there is no need even for thought of God, since   
there is only God within you and not any more of you.   
The question, for whom this thought arises? is necessary and must   
be continued, till worldly thoughts keep bothering you. At one stage, for  
whom this thought arises? - will not arise at all. That   
is abidance in Self. If this abidance in Self becomes permanent,   
then it is Sahaja Stithi. Thereafter every worldly activity of yours   
will be done by That, as Ribhu Gita, Ch.26 Verse 25 states.   
Arunachala Siva.

What is the feeling of existing ? Seek within. What is the feeling on  
existing ? Now.   
Sometimes I call myself to find myself : Q : hello ? A : hmm ? Q: hello ?  
A:ar hmmm ? Q:hello ? A:... I am here ?   
But I am is coloured by the impressions/conditioning picked up. Holding the I  
am, deeper and deeper into the I am you go, beyond the impressions until there  
is just I am, and then one step further. .. which cannot be described.

Dear I,   
It takes a mammoth effort to do something, to think and it takes absolutely no  
effort at all to simply be. This is the greatest irony that 'mind' thinks  
other wise and never rests! This is the essence of 'I am'   
Just cast of the very need to understand this and simply be. do not attempt to  
know or even bother to answer your question, cast of your very question  
itself, relax and just be. You do not need to know anything about "I am" that  
is really being 'I am'   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
This. .. "Cast off everything and just be". .. when you say it, someone takes  
it into the mind. And then, its a memory.   
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
how to cast off everything and just be ?   
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
You tell me... you told this. .. just be. .. but do u really remain like that?  
The point is simple. .. anger just comes in a moment's time! IT wont give you  
time enough to refer to your memory and find "who am i sentence" and do it!   
Love!

Dear I,   
The moment you responded, you are not just being. You - 'I' \- Thoughts just  
don't want to be. see it wants to continue.   
Quote  
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
they don't come automatically, it comes because there is a need for all these  
emotions. To put it more clearly, these emotions arise because when any  
thought which arises and questions the very foundation of you - 'I' \- your  
thoughts, then it responds frantically, anger, fear, etc.. comes because it  
itself is under threat, its place is under question. hence these emotions  
arise.   
And at the same time, if any emotions such as comforting or happiness arises,  
it is nothing but anything that is conforming to what it already knows, it  
feels stronger, its place is assured, hence such emotions.   
emotions such as lust arise because of its inherent need of security to exist  
permanently. Lust need not necessarily be physical, money, material etc.. are  
all accumulated because of insecurity or incmpleteness.   
Quote  
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
If the person is already as you say Just Is, then he would not have posted it  
here. and as you say "if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement  
does not help him. .. coz his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no  
choice." is because, thoughts have to die, Manonasham is this. Thoughts - you  
- 'I' need thoughts to survive.   
The very moment you read this post you have already put effort. Just Be is  
zero effort. zero thinking, where you can't see that you are not thinking for  
if you begin to see that you are not thinking, you have put an effort there.  
Just Be.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

## How to watch the sense 'I am'  
Author: snow                Date: January 07, 2010, 03:06:33 PM  
---  
Nisargadatta Maharaj said that it is very important to watch "I-am-ness" all  
the time. I don't however understand what this sense "I Am" contains. Does it  
include seeing, smelling, hearing etc.? Should I be mindful of these also? Or  
is it enough if I just do like Maharshi said: "Get rid of your present  
thoughts, that is all."   
This however seems a little difficult (atleast when I'm not meditating). But  
would you say that just letting go of thinking is basically all that is  
necessary.

Dear Snow,   
Good question.   
It is the natural feeling of the sense of "I am" which Nisargadatta Maharaj is  
pointing to.   
This feeling is there even if we shut out our senses. For example: We can close our eyes and shut out the sense of vision. "I am" is still there.   
We can close our ears with our fingers and shut out the sense of hearing. "I  
am" is still there.   
We can close our mouth and shut out the sense of taste. "I am" is still there.   
So what is this "I am" which seems to be independent of senses etc.   
How far can we go towards its source?   
Bhagavan Ramana says to find out, "from where this 'I' arises".   
In the process attention will go towards the pure consciousness within.   
Nisargadatta Maharaj says to remain with the sense of "I am" at its root (as  
far as possible) without allowing thoughts to extend "I am" as "I am this or  
that" (like "I am Henry", "I am a teacher", "I am feeling hot" etc.). The  
effect of this is also to take one towards the pure consciousness within.

The state of I AM is simply I AM.   
It is defintely not I am this or I am that.   
I AM is the state of Existence/Witness.   
Dear snow, it is ver difficult to remain in that I AM. That is why   
Bhagavan Ramana said: Ask for whom this thought? It is for me.   
Who am I? Keep on killing the soldiers coming out of the enemy   
fortress. It is difficult, so Bhagavan said Atma Vidya is very easy.   
It is because, we are carrying huge dirt of thoughts and vasanas,   
from many previous births. Guru's Grace alone will remove it one   
stroke, like the Sun removes the darkness of a room, closed and kept in  
darkness for years.

Is this one necessary to say? Isn't it pretty obivious? I find this not to be  
as powerful question to the mind than "Who am I" which is (like Adyashanti  
said) an alarm clock thrown in the dream.   
And can Bhagavan be my guru even though he left his body decades ago?

Dear snow,   
"I find this one as not powerful question..." \- I am not clear   
as to what this question, which is not powerful, that you refer.   
Kindly let me know.   
Should Bhagavan Ramana be only living in a body, to be our Guru?   
He remained in body for some years. One cannot live for ever in   
body. Further, why do you associate a body, for selecting a guru?   
Only those who are body conscious should worry about the guru being   
in body. Is not His Presence, powerful enough, to be your Guru?   
His Presence is all pervading but the power is felt at its highest   
in His Samadhi as well as in Old Hall, where He sat for 23 years   
and guided devotees. If you visit T'malai next time, kindly sit   
in the Samadhi Hall or Old Hall, for about an hour. You shall   
definitely feel the Power of Presence, engulfing you.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear snow,   
Yes. Letting go of all thoughts about the objective world - is   
the thoughtless state, that is essential for self enquiry. Thought   
about God within, Bhagavan Ramana says, Atma Nishtaparan, in   
Who am I? is the greatest devotion. Hence this thought should   
be retained till it matures into surrender. Once the total surrender   
becomes your nature, there is no need even for thought of God, since   
there is only God within you and not any more of you.   
The question, for whom this thought arises? is necessary and must   
be continued, till worldly thoughts keep bothering you. At one stage, for  
whom this thought arises? - will not arise at all. That   
is abidance in Self. If this abidance in Self becomes permanent,   
then it is Sahaja Stithi. Thereafter every worldly activity of yours   
will be done by That, as Ribhu Gita, Ch.26 Verse 25 states.   
Arunachala Siva.

What is the feeling of existing ? Seek within. What is the feeling on  
existing ? Now.   
Sometimes I call myself to find myself : Q : hello ? A : hmm ? Q: hello ?  
A:ar hmmm ? Q:hello ? A:... I am here ?   
But I am is coloured by the impressions/conditioning picked up. Holding the I  
am, deeper and deeper into the I am you go, beyond the impressions until there  
is just I am, and then one step further. .. which cannot be described.

Just cast of the very need to understand this and simply be. do not attempt to  
know or even bother to answer your question, cast of your very question  
itself, relax and just be. You do not need to know anything about "I am" that  
is really being 'I am'

Dear Nagaraj,   
This. .. "Cast off everything and just be". .. when you say it, someone takes  
it into the mind. And then, its a memory.   
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
how to cast off everything and just be ?   
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
You tell me... you told this. .. just be. .. but do u really remain like that?  
The point is simple. .. anger just comes in a moment's time! IT wont give you  
time enough to refer to your memory and find "who am i sentence" and do it!   
Love!

Dear I,   
The moment you responded, you are not just being. You - 'I' \- Thoughts just  
don't want to be. see it wants to continue.   
Quote  
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
they don't come automatically, it comes because there is a need for all these  
emotions. To put it more clearly, these emotions arise because when any  
thought which arises and questions the very foundation of you - 'I' \- your  
thoughts, then it responds frantically, anger, fear, etc.. comes because it  
itself is under threat, its place is under question. hence these emotions  
arise.   
And at the same time, if any emotions such as comforting or happiness arises,  
it is nothing but anything that is conforming to what it already knows, it  
feels stronger, its place is assured, hence such emotions.   
emotions such as lust arise because of its inherent need of security to exist  
permanently. Lust need not necessarily be physical, money, material etc.. are  
all accumulated because of insecurity or incmpleteness.   
Quote  
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
If the person is already as you say Just Is, then he would not have posted it  
here. and as you say "if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement  
does not help him. .. coz his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no  
choice." is because, thoughts have to die, Manonasham is this. Thoughts - you  
- 'I' need thoughts to survive.   
The very moment you read this post you have already put effort. Just Be is  
zero effort. zero thinking, where you can't see that you are not thinking for  
if you begin to see that you are not thinking, you have put an effort there.  
Just Be.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Is eating and drinking also part of effort and one requires to refrain from  
them to "Just Be"?   
What do you say?   
I am trying to understand whether it can be classified as a thoughtful or

I am trying to understand whether it can be classified as a thoughtful or  
thoughtless activity.  
Why do you - 'I' want to know, whether eating and drinking also is part of  
effort and whether one has to refrain from them to "Just Be" \- please see,  
this very need is taking you - 'I' away from Just Being. This is what you -  
'I' \- Mind - Thought is doing. Questioning!   
Just for purposes of clarity, in a thoughtless (state) what matters to you -  
'I' ? why speculate about it now Thinking about it? what ever you think about  
it now, is going to be false as it falls in the realms of thoughts only!   
A honest answer thought can give is - "you - thought - 'I' will know answer  
for your question only in thought-less (state) {in reality you will never know  
for you - thoughts will never be there to know this answer}   
Ideally, Ramana Mahashi would say, first get to the thoughtless (state) and  
then ask this question.   
You - 'I' (as in - Thoughts) can never know Manonasham (state) what ever you  
know is just thought alone! Please see, it is you - 'I' \- Mind - thought that  
is just hungry for thinking - Thoughts, Mind just want to procreate for  
continuity for eternity.   
Please see, as I mentioned in other posts about the Sushupti (State), is there  
any hunger, thirst, life, Body, others, world, are you there? where are these  
questions about the effort and effortlessness, activity and inactivity!

How to watch the sense 'I am'  
Dear Snow,   
Sence of "I am" is what watches so called "you" all the time. Try to get rid  
of it and you will not succeed. When you are defeated in such a way, you'll  
see how to watch it.

dear rideforever you said   
" Please help me understand. You say do not try. .. so you mean do nothing ?  
Or are you saying do something subtle ?"**   
try as you like, it is ok to meditate, to make effort..but know that all  
effort is contraproductive as a mental concentration activity..   
what we look for is eternal, everpresent concioussness...and it is simply the  
arising of htis moment..not a big thing..just this   
now tell me Who creates thsi moment...if you found a personality who makes  
this moment   
then tell me next who sustains this moment?   
if you can find someone then show me a person who transcends this moment...   
oyu will never find anything apart from this moment...no sustainer no creator  
no destroyer   
it simply is...and no one is there to make this...yo effor tis senseless...but  
still we need to make effort daily   
its a paradox but a very gentle and loving paradox..so make effort, hard  
effort and then more and more subtle but know deeply understand deeply that it  
is for nothing because there is no one to achive enlightment, enlightment is  
allready (primordially) the nature of htis moment...it is self arising,  
spontanious samadhi   
you cannot reach it, you cannot miss it, you can not grasp it hold it or  
whatever...so best thing is to relax...

If you are looking or if you are relaxing, you are doing something.   
"Is there any meaning in wanting to be a jnani ?", or does enlightenment just  
happen ?   
"Is it possible to make an effort to be a jnani ?"   
"Why did Sri Ramana write a book about jnana ? reading a book is gaining a  
vasana"   
Yes, I think, wanting to be a jnana might have some value. I am not saying  
definitely, I am saying there is a possibility that it would help to want to  
be a jnana.   
The instruction "hold onto the I-feeling". This is a vasana. Can it help you  
? Perhaps.   
Perhaps if you have a small amount of wanting, a small amount of doing, it can  
take you 95% on the path, and then you give that up and you are pulled from  
the other side 5%.   
If you think that any effort is against jnana, then stop being a jnana. Stop  
relaxing. Stop looking. Forget it.

Bhagavan Ramana has said the following on the various points   
mentioned: 1. Desiring the Self is the only desire that one can have. If   
desire is meant as vasana, this is the only vasana that one can   
have.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana did write books, did have some thoughts,   
why only thoughts, He did have dreams too. He did drinking   
and sleeping. He has said that this is done by the Pure Mind   
or Suddha Manas, or Sattva Manas, which does not produce   
any prarabdha effect. It is from the Pure Mind, which is like   
the burnt rope. The burnt rope has only a form but of little   
use for any activity i.e. activity that we normally mean.   
He has also said that the Self does everything that a self realized   
jnani does. It is an advaitic paradox. Sri Sankara did all the work,   
including pilgrimages (which Bhagavan Ramana did not do) with   
this Pure Mind or the Self. It is said in Tamil - Ninaiyamal ninainthu...  
thinking without thinking, sollaamal solli. .. telling   
without telling.... kaanaamal kandu....seeing without seeing.   
It is like doing acitivity in a dream. He has said this to Maurice   
Frydman in one of His conversations.

This article which seems written by Maurice Frydman is actually yours, it has  
become yours when you have read it. Its again your thought. Like this all the  
various books written by various devotees are verily their own (your)  
thoughts.   
Is it not just a thought again? that Bhagawan had thoughts, dreams, ate, drank  
etc...? whose thoughts are these? Who is the 'I' to whom these thoughts arise?  
please see.   
They are all just thoughts.

Who is the I that is saying "... then i would never desire to have a bad

Dear Nagaraj,   
Is eating and drinking also part of effort and one requires to refrain from  
them to "Just Be"?   
What do you say?   
I am trying to understand whether it can be classified as a thoughtful or  
thoughtless activity.

I am trying to understand whether it can be classified as a thoughtful or  
thoughtless activity.  
Why do you - 'I' want to know, whether eating and drinking also is part of  
effort and whether one has to refrain from them to "Just Be" \- please see,  
this very need is taking you - 'I' away from Just Being. This is what you -  
'I' \- Mind - Thought is doing. Questioning!   
Just for purposes of clarity, in a thoughtless (state) what matters to you -  
'I' ? why speculate about it now Thinking about it? what ever you think about  
it now, is going to be false as it falls in the realms of thoughts only!   
A honest answer thought can give is - "you - thought - 'I' will know answer  
for your question only in thought-less (state) {in reality you will never know  
for you - thoughts will never be there to know this answer}   
Ideally, Ramana Mahashi would say, first get to the thoughtless (state) and  
then ask this question.   
You - 'I' (as in - Thoughts) can never know Manonasham (state) what ever you  
know is just thought alone! Please see, it is you - 'I' \- Mind - thought that  
is just hungry for thinking - Thoughts, Mind just want to procreate for  
continuity for eternity.   
Please see, as I mentioned in other posts about the Sushupti (State), is there  
any hunger, thirst, life, Body, others, world, are you there? where are these  
questions about the effort and effortlessness, activity and inactivity!

How to watch the sense 'I am'  
Dear Snow,   
Sence of "I am" is what watches so called "you" all the time. Try to get rid  
of it and you will not succeed. When you are defeated in such a way, you'll  
see how to watch it.

dear rideforever you said   
" Please help me understand. You say do not try. .. so you mean do nothing ?  
Or are you saying do something subtle ?"**   
try as you like, it is ok to meditate, to make effort..but know that all  
effort is contraproductive as a mental concentration activity..   
what we look for is eternal, everpresent concioussness...and it is simply the  
arising of htis moment..not a big thing..just this   
now tell me Who creates thsi moment...if you found a personality who makes  
this moment   
then tell me next who sustains this moment?   
if you can find someone then show me a person who transcends this moment...   
oyu will never find anything apart from this moment...no sustainer no creator  
no destroyer   
it simply is...and no one is there to make this...yo effor tis senseless...but  
still we need to make effort daily   
its a paradox but a very gentle and loving paradox..so make effort, hard  
effort and then more and more subtle but know deeply understand deeply that it  
is for nothing because there is no one to achive enlightment, enlightment is  
allready (primordially) the nature of htis moment...it is self arising,  
spontanious samadhi   
you cannot reach it, you cannot miss it, you can not grasp it hold it or  
whatever...so best thing is to relax...

what we look for. ..

If you are looking or if you are relaxing, you are doing something.   
"Is there any meaning in wanting to be a jnani ?", or does enlightenment just  
happen ?   
"Is it possible to make an effort to be a jnani ?"   
"Why did Sri Ramana write a book about jnana ? reading a book is gaining a  
vasana"   
Yes, I think, wanting to be a jnana might have some value. I am not saying  
definitely, I am saying there is a possibility that it would help to want to  
be a jnana.   
The instruction "hold onto the I-feeling". This is a vasana. Can it help you  
? Perhaps.   
Perhaps if you have a small amount of wanting, a small amount of doing, it can  
take you 95% on the path, and then you give that up and you are pulled from  
the other side 5%.   
If you think that any effort is against jnana, then stop being a jnana. Stop  
relaxing. Stop looking. Forget it.

Bhagavan Ramana has said the following on the various points   
mentioned: 1. Desiring the Self is the only desire that one can have. If   
desire is meant as vasana, this is the only vasana that one can   
have.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana did write books, did have some thoughts,   
why only thoughts, He did have dreams too. He did drinking   
and sleeping. He has said that this is done by the Pure Mind   
or Suddha Manas, or Sattva Manas, which does not produce   
any prarabdha effect. It is from the Pure Mind, which is like   
the burnt rope. The burnt rope has only a form but of little   
use for any activity i.e. activity that we normally mean.   
He has also said that the Self does everything that a self realized   
jnani does. It is an advaitic paradox. Sri Sankara did all the work,   
including pilgrimages (which Bhagavan Ramana did not do) with   
this Pure Mind or the Self. It is said in Tamil - Ninaiyamal ninainthu...  
thinking without thinking, sollaamal solli. .. telling   
without telling.... kaanaamal kandu....seeing without seeing.   
It is like doing acitivity in a dream. He has said this to Maurice   
Frydman in one of His conversations.

This article which seems written by Maurice Frydman is actually yours, it has  
become yours when you have read it. Its again your thought. Like this all the  
various books written by various devotees are verily their own (your)  
thoughts.   
Is it not just a thought again? that Bhagawan had thoughts, dreams, ate, drank  
etc...? whose thoughts are these? Who is the 'I' to whom these thoughts arise?  
please see.   
They are all just thoughts.

Dear I,   
Quote from: silentgreen on January 12, 2010, 01:13:29 PM  
Is eating and drinking also part of effort and one requires to refrain from  
them to "Just Be"?   
What do you say?   
I am trying to understand whether it can be classified as a thoughtful or  
thoughtless activity.  
Why do you - 'I' want to know, whether eating and drinking also is part of  
effort and whether one has to refrain from them to "Just Be" \- please see,  
this very need is taking you - 'I' away from Just Being. This is what you -  
'I' \- Mind - Thought is doing. Questioning!   
Just for purposes of clarity, in a thoughtless (state) what matters to you -  
'I' ? why speculate about it now Thinking about it? what ever you think about  
it now, is going to be false as it falls in the realms of thoughts only!   
A honest answer thought can give is - "you - thought - 'I' will know answer  
for your question only in thought-less (state) {in reality you will never know  
for you - thoughts will never be there to know this answer}   
Ideally, Ramana Mahashi would say, first get to the thoughtless (state) and  
then ask this question.   
You - 'I' (as in - Thoughts) can never know Manonasham (state) what ever you  
know is just thought alone! Please see, it is you - 'I' \- Mind - thought that  
is just hungry for thinking - Thoughts, Mind just want to procreate for  
continuity for eternity.   
Please see, as I mentioned in other posts about the Sushupti (State), is there  
any hunger, thirst, life, Body, others, world, are you there? where are these  
questions about the effort and effortlessness, activity and inactivity!

Why are you - Mind trying to know how Ramana was? is it of any help to you?  
You - Mind can never know Ramana. It is You - Mind - thoughts that is asking  
You - 'I' this questions - "than Ramana was doing so many things! what do u  
intend to say?" Please enquire who is the 'I' to whom this question has come!  
Who am 'I'   
Who is the one that saw Ramana doing so many things? He is to be enquired  
first! Who is Ramana and Who is the You - 'I' that saw Ramana doing so many  
things.   
More primarily, what is 'Doing'? What are 'Things', that you are talking  
about?   
And when you mentioned - "what do u intend to say?" Pleas tell me actually to

How to watch the sense 'I am'  
Dear Snow,   
Sence of "I am" is what watches so called "you" all the time. Try to get rid  
of it and you will not succeed. When you are defeated in such a way, you'll  
see how to watch it.

dear rideforever you said   
" Please help me understand. You say do not try. .. so you mean do nothing ?  
Or are you saying do something subtle ?"**   
try as you like, it is ok to meditate, to make effort..but know that all  
effort is contraproductive as a mental concentration activity..   
what we look for is eternal, everpresent concioussness...and it is simply the  
arising of htis moment..not a big thing..just this   
now tell me Who creates thsi moment...if you found a personality who makes  
this moment   
then tell me next who sustains this moment?   
if you can find someone then show me a person who transcends this moment...   
oyu will never find anything apart from this moment...no sustainer no creator  
no destroyer   
it simply is...and no one is there to make this...yo effor tis senseless...but  
still we need to make effort daily   
its a paradox but a very gentle and loving paradox..so make effort, hard  
effort and then more and more subtle but know deeply understand deeply that it  
is for nothing because there is no one to achive enlightment, enlightment is  
allready (primordially) the nature of htis moment...it is self arising,  
spontanious samadhi   
you cannot reach it, you cannot miss it, you can not grasp it hold it or  
whatever...so best thing is to relax...

what we look for. ..

If you are looking or if you are relaxing, you are doing something.   
"Is there any meaning in wanting to be a jnani ?", or does enlightenment just  
happen ?   
"Is it possible to make an effort to be a jnani ?"   
"Why did Sri Ramana write a book about jnana ? reading a book is gaining a  
vasana"   
Yes, I think, wanting to be a jnana might have some value. I am not saying  
definitely, I am saying there is a possibility that it would help to want to  
be a jnana.   
The instruction "hold onto the I-feeling". This is a vasana. Can it help you  
? Perhaps.   
Perhaps if you have a small amount of wanting, a small amount of doing, it can  
take you 95% on the path, and then you give that up and you are pulled from  
the other side 5%.   
If you think that any effort is against jnana, then stop being a jnana. Stop  
relaxing. Stop looking. Forget it.

Bhagavan Ramana has said the following on the various points   
mentioned: 1. Desiring the Self is the only desire that one can have. If   
desire is meant as vasana, this is the only vasana that one can   
have.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana did write books, did have some thoughts,   
why only thoughts, He did have dreams too. He did drinking   
and sleeping. He has said that this is done by the Pure Mind   
or Suddha Manas, or Sattva Manas, which does not produce   
any prarabdha effect. It is from the Pure Mind, which is like   
the burnt rope. The burnt rope has only a form but of little   
use for any activity i.e. activity that we normally mean.   
He has also said that the Self does everything that a self realized   
jnani does. It is an advaitic paradox. Sri Sankara did all the work,   
including pilgrimages (which Bhagavan Ramana did not do) with   
this Pure Mind or the Self. It is said in Tamil - Ninaiyamal ninainthu...  
thinking without thinking, sollaamal solli. .. telling   
without telling.... kaanaamal kandu....seeing without seeing.   
It is like doing acitivity in a dream. He has said this to Maurice   
Frydman in one of His conversations.   
Arunachala Siva.

This article which seems written by Maurice Frydman is actually yours, it has  
become yours when you have read it. Its again your thought. Like this all the  
various books written by various devotees are verily their own (your)  
thoughts.   
Is it not just a thought again? that Bhagawan had thoughts, dreams, ate, drank  
etc...? whose thoughts are these? Who is the 'I' to whom these thoughts arise?  
please see.   
They are all just thoughts.

Dear I,

1\. The moment one does something if its lost. .. than Ramana was doing so  
many things! what do u intend to say?  
Why are you - Mind trying to know how Ramana was? is it of any help to you?  
You - Mind can never know Ramana. It is You - Mind - thoughts that is asking  
You - 'I' this questions - "than Ramana was doing so many things! what do u  
intend to say?" Please enquire who is the 'I' to whom this question has come!  
Who am 'I'   
Who is the one that saw Ramana doing so many things? He is to be enquired  
first! Who is Ramana and Who is the You - 'I' that saw Ramana doing so many  
things.   
More primarily, what is 'Doing'? What are 'Things', that you are talking  
about?   
And when you mentioned - "what do u intend to say?" Pleas tell me actually to  
whom are you asking this question? Who is the "u" in "what do **u** intend to  
say?"   
Quote from: srkudai on January 12, 2010, 02:32:38 PM  
2.what kind of self inquiry are you talking about Nagaraj?   
When a thought came. ..   
and you remembered that you have to question to whom it has come...   
the original thought is already over. the thought now is this remembrance.   
while the illusion is created as if you are killing the previous thought!!   
and if u did not remember, you cannot ask the question either.   
so u sit for just be. .. and the thought arose. .. it did not ask u permission  
to arise. it just arose.... and nothing can be done about it! u try it  
tomorrow. just sit. thought arises. when you remembered your self inquiry and  
tried to use it to "resolve that thought". .. this remembrance is slow. by  
that time the thought has already passed away.   
infact the reason u r saying this always but not doing it is. .. u r not able  
to do it. .. coz its impractical!  
First, please tell me - You - 'I'(Please introspect), why the thought arised.  
Then we can look further!   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

How to watch the sense 'I am'  
Dear Snow,   
Sence of "I am" is what watches so called "you" all the time. Try to get rid  
of it and you will not succeed. When you are defeated in such a way, you'll  
see how to watch it.

dear rideforever you said   
" Please help me understand. You say do not try. .. so you mean do nothing ?  
Or are you saying do something subtle ?"**   
try as you like, it is ok to meditate, to make effort..but know that all  
effort is contraproductive as a mental concentration activity..   
what we look for is eternal, everpresent concioussness...and it is simply the  
arising of htis moment..not a big thing..just this   
now tell me Who creates thsi moment...if you found a personality who makes  
this moment   
then tell me next who sustains this moment?   
if you can find someone then show me a person who transcends this moment...   
oyu will never find anything apart from this moment...no sustainer no creator  
no destroyer   
it simply is...and no one is there to make this...yo effor tis senseless...but  
still we need to make effort daily   
its a paradox but a very gentle and loving paradox..so make effort, hard  
effort and then more and more subtle but know deeply understand deeply that it  
is for nothing because there is no one to achive enlightment, enlightment is  
allready (primordially) the nature of htis moment...it is self arising,  
spontanious samadhi   
you cannot reach it, you cannot miss it, you can not grasp it hold it or  
whatever...so best thing is to relax...

what we look for. ..   
so best thing is to relax...   
If you are looking or if you are relaxing, you are doing something.   
"Is there any meaning in wanting to be a jnani ?", or does enlightenment just  
happen ?   
"Is it possible to make an effort to be a jnani ?"   
"Why did Sri Ramana write a book about jnana ? reading a book is gaining a  
vasana"   
Yes, I think, wanting to be a jnana might have some value. I am not saying  
definitely, I am saying there is a possibility that it would help to want to  
be a jnana.   
The instruction "hold onto the I-feeling". This is a vasana. Can it help you  
? Perhaps.   
Perhaps if you have a small amount of wanting, a small amount of doing, it can  
take you 95% on the path, and then you give that up and you are pulled from  
the other side 5%.   
If you think that any effort is against jnana, then stop being a jnana. Stop  
relaxing. Stop looking. Forget it.

Bhagavan Ramana has said the following on the various points   
mentioned: 1. Desiring the Self is the only desire that one can have. If   
desire is meant as vasana, this is the only vasana that one can   
have.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana did write books, did have some thoughts,   
why only thoughts, He did have dreams too. He did drinking   
and sleeping. He has said that this is done by the Pure Mind   
or Suddha Manas, or Sattva Manas, which does not produce   
any prarabdha effect. It is from the Pure Mind, which is like   
the burnt rope. The burnt rope has only a form but of little   
use for any activity i.e. activity that we normally mean.   
He has also said that the Self does everything that a self realized   
jnani does. It is an advaitic paradox. Sri Sankara did all the work,   
including pilgrimages (which Bhagavan Ramana did not do) with   
this Pure Mind or the Self. It is said in Tamil - Ninaiyamal ninainthu...  
thinking without thinking, sollaamal solli. .. telling   
without telling.... kaanaamal kandu....seeing without seeing.   
It is like doing acitivity in a dream. He has said this to Maurice   
Frydman in one of His conversations.   
Arunachala Siva.

This article which seems written by Maurice Frydman is actually yours, it has  
become yours when you have read it. Its again your thought. Like this all the  
various books written by various devotees are verily their own (your)  
thoughts.   
Is it not just a thought again? that Bhagawan had thoughts, dreams, ate, drank  
etc...? whose thoughts are these? Who is the 'I' to whom these thoughts arise?  
please see.   
They are all just thoughts.

I am trying to understand whether it can be classified as a thoughtful or  
thoughtless activity.  
Why do you - 'I' want to know, whether eating and drinking also is part of  
effort and whether one has to refrain from them to "Just Be" \- please see,  
this very need is taking you - 'I' away from Just Being. This is what you -  
'I' \- Mind - Thought is doing. Questioning!   
Just for purposes of clarity, in a thoughtless (state) what matters to you -  
'I' ? why speculate about it now Thinking about it? what ever you think about  
it now, is going to be false as it falls in the realms of thoughts only!   
A honest answer thought can give is - "you - thought - 'I' will know answer  
for your question only in thought-less (state) {in reality you will never know  
for you - thoughts will never be there to know this answer}   
Ideally, Ramana Mahashi would say, first get to the thoughtless (state) and  
then ask this question.   
You - 'I' (as in - Thoughts) can never know Manonasham (state) what ever you  
know is just thought alone! Please see, it is you - 'I' \- Mind - thought that  
is just hungry for thinking - Thoughts, Mind just want to procreate for  
continuity for eternity.   
Please see, as I mentioned in other posts about the Sushupti (State), is there  
any hunger, thirst, life, Body, others, world, are you there? where are these  
questions about the effort and effortlessness, activity and inactivity!

How to watch the sense 'I am'  
Dear Snow,   
Sence of "I am" is what watches so called "you" all the time. Try to get rid  
of it and you will not succeed. When you are defeated in such a way, you'll  
see how to watch it.

dear rideforever you said   
" Please help me understand. You say do not try. .. so you mean do nothing ?  
Or are you saying do something subtle ?"**   
try as you like, it is ok to meditate, to make effort..but know that all  
effort is contraproductive as a mental concentration activity..   
what we look for is eternal, everpresent concioussness...and it is simply the  
arising of htis moment..not a big thing..just this   
now tell me Who creates thsi moment...if you found a personality who makes  
this moment   
then tell me next who sustains this moment?   
if you can find someone then show me a person who transcends this moment...   
oyu will never find anything apart from this moment...no sustainer no creator  
no destroyer   
it simply is...and no one is there to make this...yo effor tis senseless...but  
still we need to make effort daily   
its a paradox but a very gentle and loving paradox..so make effort, hard  
effort and then more and more subtle but know deeply understand deeply that it  
is for nothing because there is no one to achive enlightment, enlightment is  
allready (primordially) the nature of htis moment...it is self arising,  
spontanious samadhi   
you cannot reach it, you cannot miss it, you can not grasp it hold it or  
whatever...so best thing is to relax...

If you are looking or if you are relaxing, you are doing something.   
"Is there any meaning in wanting to be a jnani ?", or does enlightenment just  
happen ?   
"Is it possible to make an effort to be a jnani ?"   
"Why did Sri Ramana write a book about jnana ? reading a book is gaining a  
vasana"   
Yes, I think, wanting to be a jnana might have some value. I am not saying  
definitely, I am saying there is a possibility that it would help to want to  
be a jnana.   
The instruction "hold onto the I-feeling". This is a vasana. Can it help you  
? Perhaps.   
Perhaps if you have a small amount of wanting, a small amount of doing, it can  
take you 95% on the path, and then you give that up and you are pulled from  
the other side 5%.   
If you think that any effort is against jnana, then stop being a jnana. Stop  
relaxing. Stop looking. Forget it.

Bhagavan Ramana has said the following on the various points   
mentioned: 1. Desiring the Self is the only desire that one can have. If   
desire is meant as vasana, this is the only vasana that one can   
have.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana did write books, did have some thoughts,   
why only thoughts, He did have dreams too. He did drinking   
and sleeping. He has said that this is done by the Pure Mind   
or Suddha Manas, or Sattva Manas, which does not produce   
any prarabdha effect. It is from the Pure Mind, which is like   
the burnt rope. The burnt rope has only a form but of little   
use for any activity i.e. activity that we normally mean.   
He has also said that the Self does everything that a self realized   
jnani does. It is an advaitic paradox. Sri Sankara did all the work,   
including pilgrimages (which Bhagavan Ramana did not do) with   
this Pure Mind or the Self. It is said in Tamil - Ninaiyamal ninainthu...  
thinking without thinking, sollaamal solli. .. telling   
without telling.... kaanaamal kandu....seeing without seeing.   
It is like doing acitivity in a dream. He has said this to Maurice   
Frydman in one of His conversations.   
Arunachala Siva.

This article which seems written by Maurice Frydman is actually yours, it has  
become yours when you have read it. Its again your thought. Like this all the  
various books written by various devotees are verily their own (your)  
thoughts.   
Is it not just a thought again? that Bhagawan had thoughts, dreams, ate, drank  
etc...? whose thoughts are these? Who is the 'I' to whom these thoughts arise?  
please see.   
They are all just thoughts.

them to "Just Be"?

I am trying to understand whether it can be classified as a thoughtful or  
thoughtless activity.  
Why do you - 'I' want to know, whether eating and drinking also is part of  
effort and whether one has to refrain from them to "Just Be" \- please see,  
this very need is taking you - 'I' away from Just Being. This is what you -  
'I' \- Mind - Thought is doing. Questioning!   
Just for purposes of clarity, in a thoughtless (state) what matters to you -  
'I' ? why speculate about it now Thinking about it? what ever you think about  
it now, is going to be false as it falls in the realms of thoughts only!   
A honest answer thought can give is - "you - thought - 'I' will know answer  
for your question only in thought-less (state) {in reality you will never know  
for you - thoughts will never be there to know this answer}   
Ideally, Ramana Mahashi would say, first get to the thoughtless (state) and  
then ask this question.   
You - 'I' (as in - Thoughts) can never know Manonasham (state) what ever you  
know is just thought alone! Please see, it is you - 'I' \- Mind - thought that  
is just hungry for thinking - Thoughts, Mind just want to procreate for  
continuity for eternity.   
Please see, as I mentioned in other posts about the Sushupti (State), is there  
any hunger, thirst, life, Body, others, world, are you there? where are these  
questions about the effort and effortlessness, activity and inactivity!

what we look for. ..   
so best thing is to relax...   
If you are looking or if you are relaxing, you are doing something.   
"Is there any meaning in wanting to be a jnani ?", or does enlightenment just  
happen ?   
"Is it possible to make an effort to be a jnani ?"   
"Why did Sri Ramana write a book about jnana ? reading a book is gaining a  
vasana"   
Yes, I think, wanting to be a jnana might have some value. I am not saying  
definitely, I am saying there is a possibility that it would help to want to  
be a jnana.   
The instruction "hold onto the I-feeling". This is a vasana. Can it help you  
? Perhaps.   
Perhaps if you have a small amount of wanting, a small amount of doing, it can  
take you 95% on the path, and then you give that up and you are pulled from  
the other side 5%.   
If you think that any effort is against jnana, then stop being a jnana. Stop  
relaxing. Stop looking. Forget it.

Bhagavan Ramana has said the following on the various points   
mentioned: 1. Desiring the Self is the only desire that one can have. If   
desire is meant as vasana, this is the only vasana that one can   
have.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana did write books, did have some thoughts,   
why only thoughts, He did have dreams too. He did drinking   
and sleeping. He has said that this is done by the Pure Mind   
or Suddha Manas, or Sattva Manas, which does not produce   
any prarabdha effect. It is from the Pure Mind, which is like   
the burnt rope. The burnt rope has only a form but of little   
use for any activity i.e. activity that we normally mean.   
He has also said that the Self does everything that a self realized   
jnani does. It is an advaitic paradox. Sri Sankara did all the work,   
including pilgrimages (which Bhagavan Ramana did not do) with   
this Pure Mind or the Self. It is said in Tamil - Ninaiyamal ninainthu...  
thinking without thinking, sollaamal solli. .. telling   
without telling.... kaanaamal kandu....seeing without seeing.   
It is like doing acitivity in a dream. He has said this to Maurice   
Frydman in one of His conversations.   
Arunachala Siva.

This article which seems written by Maurice Frydman is actually yours, it has  
become yours when you have read it. Its again your thought. Like this all the  
various books written by various devotees are verily their own (your)  
thoughts.   
Is it not just a thought again? that Bhagawan had thoughts, dreams, ate, drank  
etc...? whose thoughts are these? Who is the 'I' to whom these thoughts arise?  
please see.   
They are all just thoughts.

I am trying to understand whether it can be classified as a thoughtful or  
thoughtless activity.  
Why do you - 'I' want to know, whether eating and drinking also is part of  
effort and whether one has to refrain from them to "Just Be" \- please see,  
this very need is taking you - 'I' away from Just Being. This is what you -  
'I' \- Mind - Thought is doing. Questioning!   
Just for purposes of clarity, in a thoughtless (state) what matters to you -  
'I' ? why speculate about it now Thinking about it? what ever you think about  
it now, is going to be false as it falls in the realms of thoughts only!   
A honest answer thought can give is - "you - thought - 'I' will know answer  
for your question only in thought-less (state) {in reality you will never know  
for you - thoughts will never be there to know this answer}   
Ideally, Ramana Mahashi would say, first get to the thoughtless (state) and  
then ask this question.   
You - 'I' (as in - Thoughts) can never know Manonasham (state) what ever you  
know is just thought alone! Please see, it is you - 'I' \- Mind - thought that  
is just hungry for thinking - Thoughts, Mind just want to procreate for  
continuity for eternity.   
Please see, as I mentioned in other posts about the Sushupti (State), is there  
any hunger, thirst, life, Body, others, world, are you there? where are these  
questions about the effort and effortlessness, activity and inactivity!

Dear Snow,   
Sence of "I am" is what watches so called "you" all the time. Try to get rid  
of it and you will not succeed. When you are defeated in such a way, you'll  
see how to watch it.

dear rideforever you said   
" Please help me understand. You say do not try. .. so you mean do nothing ?  
Or are you saying do something subtle ?"**   
try as you like, it is ok to meditate, to make effort..but know that all  
effort is contraproductive as a mental concentration activity..   
what we look for is eternal, everpresent concioussness...and it is simply the  
arising of htis moment..not a big thing..just this   
now tell me Who creates thsi moment...if you found a personality who makes  
this moment   
then tell me next who sustains this moment?   
if you can find someone then show me a person who transcends this moment...   
oyu will never find anything apart from this moment...no sustainer no creator  
no destroyer   
it simply is...and no one is there to make this...yo effor tis senseless...but  
still we need to make effort daily   
its a paradox but a very gentle and loving paradox..so make effort, hard  
effort and then more and more subtle but know deeply understand deeply that it  
is for nothing because there is no one to achive enlightment, enlightment is  
allready (primordially) the nature of htis moment...it is self arising,  
spontanious samadhi   
you cannot reach it, you cannot miss it, you can not grasp it hold it or  
whatever...so best thing is to relax...

If you are looking or if you are relaxing, you are doing something.   
"Is there any meaning in wanting to be a jnani ?", or does enlightenment just  
happen ?   
"Is it possible to make an effort to be a jnani ?"

Yes, I think, wanting to be a jnana might have some value. I am not saying  
definitely, I am saying there is a possibility that it would help to want to  
be a jnana.   
The instruction "hold onto the I-feeling". This is a vasana. Can it help you  
? Perhaps.   
Perhaps if you have a small amount of wanting, a small amount of doing, it can  
take you 95% on the path, and then you give that up and you are pulled from  
the other side 5%.   
If you think that any effort is against jnana, then stop being a jnana. Stop  
relaxing. Stop looking. Forget it.

Bhagavan Ramana has said the following on the various points   
mentioned: 1. Desiring the Self is the only desire that one can have. If   
desire is meant as vasana, this is the only vasana that one can   
have.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana did write books, did have some thoughts,   
why only thoughts, He did have dreams too. He did drinking   
and sleeping. He has said that this is done by the Pure Mind   
or Suddha Manas, or Sattva Manas, which does not produce   
any prarabdha effect. It is from the Pure Mind, which is like   
the burnt rope. The burnt rope has only a form but of little   
use for any activity i.e. activity that we normally mean.   
He has also said that the Self does everything that a self realized

Dear I,   
Quote from: Subramanian.R on January 13, 2010, 05:45:58 AM  
Bhagavan Ramana has said the following on the various points   
mentioned: 1. Desiring the Self is the only desire that one can have. If   
desire is meant as vasana, this is the only vasana that one can   
have.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana did write books, did have some thoughts,   
why only thoughts, He did have dreams too. He did drinking   
and sleeping. He has said that this is done by the Pure Mind   
or Suddha Manas, or Sattva Manas, which does not produce   
any prarabdha effect. It is from the Pure Mind, which is like   
the burnt rope. The burnt rope has only a form but of little   
use for any activity i.e. activity that we normally mean.   
He has also said that the Self does everything that a self realized   
jnani does. It is an advaitic paradox. Sri Sankara did all the work,   
including pilgrimages (which Bhagavan Ramana did not do) with   
this Pure Mind or the Self. It is said in Tamil - Ninaiyamal ninainthu...

Frydman in one of His conversations.  
This article which seems written by Maurice Frydman is actually yours, it has  
become yours when you have read it. Its again your thought. Like this all the  
various books written by various devotees are verily their own (your)  
thoughts.   
Is it not just a thought again? that Bhagawan had thoughts, dreams, ate, drank  
etc...? whose thoughts are these? Who is the 'I' to whom these thoughts arise?  
please see.   
They are all just thoughts.

I am trying to understand whether it can be classified as a thoughtful or  
thoughtless activity.  
Why do you - 'I' want to know, whether eating and drinking also is part of  
effort and whether one has to refrain from them to "Just Be" \- please see,  
this very need is taking you - 'I' away from Just Being. This is what you -  
'I' \- Mind - Thought is doing. Questioning!   
Just for purposes of clarity, in a thoughtless (state) what matters to you -  
'I' ? why speculate about it now Thinking about it? what ever you think about  
it now, is going to be false as it falls in the realms of thoughts only!   
A honest answer thought can give is - "you - thought - 'I' will know answer  
for your question only in thought-less (state) {in reality you will never know  
for you - thoughts will never be there to know this answer}   
Ideally, Ramana Mahashi would say, first get to the thoughtless (state) and  
then ask this question.   
You - 'I' (as in - Thoughts) can never know Manonasham (state) what ever you  
know is just thought alone! Please see, it is you - 'I' \- Mind - thought that  
is just hungry for thinking - Thoughts, Mind just want to procreate for  
continuity for eternity.   
Please see, as I mentioned in other posts about the Sushupti (State), is there  
any hunger, thirst, life, Body, others, world, are you there? where are these  
questions about the effort and effortlessness, activity and inactivity!

How to watch the sense 'I am'  
Dear Snow,   
Sence of "I am" is what watches so called "you" all the time. Try to get rid  
of it and you will not succeed. When you are defeated in such a way, you'll  
see how to watch it.

dear rideforever you said   
" Please help me understand. You say do not try. .. so you mean do nothing ?  
Or are you saying do something subtle ?"**   
try as you like, it is ok to meditate, to make effort..but know that all  
effort is contraproductive as a mental concentration activity..   
what we look for is eternal, everpresent concioussness...and it is simply the  
arising of htis moment..not a big thing..just this   
now tell me Who creates thsi moment...if you found a personality who makes  
this moment   
then tell me next who sustains this moment?   
if you can find someone then show me a person who transcends this moment...   
oyu will never find anything apart from this moment...no sustainer no creator  
no destroyer   
it simply is...and no one is there to make this...yo effor tis senseless...but  
still we need to make effort daily   
its a paradox but a very gentle and loving paradox..so make effort, hard  
effort and then more and more subtle but know deeply understand deeply that it  
is for nothing because there is no one to achive enlightment, enlightment is  
allready (primordially) the nature of htis moment...it is self arising,  
spontanious samadhi   
you cannot reach it, you cannot miss it, you can not grasp it hold it or  
whatever...so best thing is to relax...

what we look for. ..

If you are looking or if you are relaxing, you are doing something.   
"Is there any meaning in wanting to be a jnani ?", or does enlightenment just  
happen ?   
"Is it possible to make an effort to be a jnani ?"   
"Why did Sri Ramana write a book about jnana ? reading a book is gaining a  
vasana"   
Yes, I think, wanting to be a jnana might have some value. I am not saying  
definitely, I am saying there is a possibility that it would help to want to  
be a jnana.   
The instruction "hold onto the I-feeling". This is a vasana. Can it help you  
? Perhaps.   
Perhaps if you have a small amount of wanting, a small amount of doing, it can  
take you 95% on the path, and then you give that up and you are pulled from  
the other side 5%.   
If you think that any effort is against jnana, then stop being a jnana. Stop  
relaxing. Stop looking. Forget it.

this Pure Mind or the Self. It is said in Tamil - Ninaiyamal ninainthu...  
thinking without thinking, sollaamal solli. .. telling   
without telling.... kaanaamal kandu....seeing without seeing.   
It is like doing acitivity in a dream. He has said this to Maurice

This article which seems written by Maurice Frydman is actually yours, it has  
become yours when you have read it. Its again your thought. Like this all the  
various books written by various devotees are verily their own (your)  
thoughts.   
Is it not just a thought again? that Bhagawan had thoughts, dreams, ate, drank  
etc...? whose thoughts are these? Who is the 'I' to whom these thoughts arise?  
please see.   
They are all just thoughts.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Quote  
First, please tell me - You - 'I'(Please introspect), why the thought arised   
... it did not ask me permission to arise.   
it arose and only then u can ask this question.   
when you asked this question its already there. ..   
also Nagaraj, its useless to keep telling this is thought, this is also  
thought and so on. .. coz we know that anything written, and read has to be  
thought. why are you constantly telling its thought? it is. .. everyone knows  
that!   
and then you ask "find out who says this"... thats one more thought added to  
the list of thoughts !   
Love!

It did not arise automatically, it arose, because you were interested to see  
what the response for your question. You login here here because of some  
motive to feed your thought. More over don't all members who login here, will  
first check their own posts and then the other posts? You - 'I' \- Thoughts

Dear Nagaraj,   
Is eating and drinking also part of effort and one requires to refrain from  
them to "Just Be"?   
What do you say?   
I am trying to understand whether it can be classified as a thoughtful or  
thoughtless activity.

I am trying to understand whether it can be classified as a thoughtful or  
thoughtless activity.  
Why do you - 'I' want to know, whether eating and drinking also is part of  
effort and whether one has to refrain from them to "Just Be" \- please see,  
this very need is taking you - 'I' away from Just Being. This is what you -  
'I' \- Mind - Thought is doing. Questioning!   
Just for purposes of clarity, in a thoughtless (state) what matters to you -  
'I' ? why speculate about it now Thinking about it? what ever you think about  
it now, is going to be false as it falls in the realms of thoughts only!   
A honest answer thought can give is - "you - thought - 'I' will know answer  
for your question only in thought-less (state) {in reality you will never know  
for you - thoughts will never be there to know this answer}   
Ideally, Ramana Mahashi would say, first get to the thoughtless (state) and  
then ask this question.   
You - 'I' (as in - Thoughts) can never know Manonasham (state) what ever you  
know is just thought alone! Please see, it is you - 'I' \- Mind - thought that  
is just hungry for thinking - Thoughts, Mind just want to procreate for  
continuity for eternity.   
Please see, as I mentioned in other posts about the Sushupti (State), is there  
any hunger, thirst, life, Body, others, world, are you there? where are these  
questions about the effort and effortlessness, activity and inactivity!

Why are you - Mind trying to know how Ramana was? is it of any help to you?  
You - Mind can never know Ramana. It is You - Mind - thoughts that is asking  
You - 'I' this questions - "than Ramana was doing so many things! what do u  
intend to say?" Please enquire who is the 'I' to whom this question has come!  
Who am 'I'   
Who is the one that saw Ramana doing so many things? He is to be enquired  
first! Who is Ramana and Who is the You - 'I' that saw Ramana doing so many  
things.   
More primarily, what is 'Doing'? What are 'Things', that you are talking  
about?   
And when you mentioned - "what do u intend to say?" Pleas tell me actually to  
whom are you asking this question? Who is the "u" in "what do **u** intend to

How to watch the sense 'I am'  
Dear Snow,   
Sence of "I am" is what watches so called "you" all the time. Try to get rid  
of it and you will not succeed. When you are defeated in such a way, you'll  
see how to watch it.

dear rideforever you said   
" Please help me understand. You say do not try. .. so you mean do nothing ?  
Or are you saying do something subtle ?"**   
try as you like, it is ok to meditate, to make effort..but know that all  
effort is contraproductive as a mental concentration activity..   
what we look for is eternal, everpresent concioussness...and it is simply the  
arising of htis moment..not a big thing..just this   
now tell me Who creates thsi moment...if you found a personality who makes  
this moment   
then tell me next who sustains this moment?   
if you can find someone then show me a person who transcends this moment...   
oyu will never find anything apart from this moment...no sustainer no creator  
no destroyer   
it simply is...and no one is there to make this...yo effor tis senseless...but  
still we need to make effort daily   
its a paradox but a very gentle and loving paradox..so make effort, hard  
effort and then more and more subtle but know deeply understand deeply that it  
is for nothing because there is no one to achive enlightment, enlightment is  
allready (primordially) the nature of htis moment...it is self arising,  
spontanious samadhi   
you cannot reach it, you cannot miss it, you can not grasp it hold it or  
whatever...so best thing is to relax...

what we look for. ..

If you are looking or if you are relaxing, you are doing something.   
"Is there any meaning in wanting to be a jnani ?", or does enlightenment just  
happen ?   
"Is it possible to make an effort to be a jnani ?"   
"Why did Sri Ramana write a book about jnana ? reading a book is gaining a  
vasana"   
Yes, I think, wanting to be a jnana might have some value. I am not saying  
definitely, I am saying there is a possibility that it would help to want to  
be a jnana.   
The instruction "hold onto the I-feeling". This is a vasana. Can it help you  
? Perhaps.   
Perhaps if you have a small amount of wanting, a small amount of doing, it can  
take you 95% on the path, and then you give that up and you are pulled from  
the other side 5%.   
If you think that any effort is against jnana, then stop being a jnana. Stop  
relaxing. Stop looking. Forget it.

Bhagavan Ramana has said the following on the various points   
mentioned: 1. Desiring the Self is the only desire that one can have. If   
desire is meant as vasana, this is the only vasana that one can   
have.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana did write books, did have some thoughts,   
why only thoughts, He did have dreams too. He did drinking   
and sleeping. He has said that this is done by the Pure Mind   
or Suddha Manas, or Sattva Manas, which does not produce   
any prarabdha effect. It is from the Pure Mind, which is like   
the burnt rope. The burnt rope has only a form but of little   
use for any activity i.e. activity that we normally mean.   
He has also said that the Self does everything that a self realized   
jnani does. It is an advaitic paradox. Sri Sankara did all the work,   
including pilgrimages (which Bhagavan Ramana did not do) with   
this Pure Mind or the Self. It is said in Tamil - Ninaiyamal ninainthu...  
thinking without thinking, sollaamal solli. .. telling   
without telling.... kaanaamal kandu....seeing without seeing.   
It is like doing acitivity in a dream. He has said this to Maurice   
Frydman in one of His conversations.   
Arunachala Siva.

This article which seems written by Maurice Frydman is actually yours, it has  
become yours when you have read it. Its again your thought. Like this all the  
various books written by various devotees are verily their own (your)  
thoughts.   
Is it not just a thought again? that Bhagawan had thoughts, dreams, ate, drank  
etc...? whose thoughts are these? Who is the 'I' to whom these thoughts arise?  
please see.   
They are all just thoughts.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Is eating and drinking also part of effort and one requires to refrain from  
them to "Just Be"?   
What do you say?   
I am trying to understand whether it can be classified as a thoughtful or  
thoughtless activity.

I am trying to understand whether it can be classified as a thoughtful or  
thoughtless activity.  
Why do you - 'I' want to know, whether eating and drinking also is part of  
effort and whether one has to refrain from them to "Just Be" \- please see,  
this very need is taking you - 'I' away from Just Being. This is what you -  
'I' \- Mind - Thought is doing. Questioning!   
Just for purposes of clarity, in a thoughtless (state) what matters to you -  
'I' ? why speculate about it now Thinking about it? what ever you think about  
it now, is going to be false as it falls in the realms of thoughts only!   
A honest answer thought can give is - "you - thought - 'I' will know answer  
for your question only in thought-less (state) {in reality you will never know  
for you - thoughts will never be there to know this answer}   
Ideally, Ramana Mahashi would say, first get to the thoughtless (state) and  
then ask this question.   
You - 'I' (as in - Thoughts) can never know Manonasham (state) what ever you  
know is just thought alone! Please see, it is you - 'I' \- Mind - thought that  
is just hungry for thinking - Thoughts, Mind just want to procreate for  
continuity for eternity.   
Please see, as I mentioned in other posts about the Sushupti (State), is there  
any hunger, thirst, life, Body, others, world, are you there? where are these  
questions about the effort and effortlessness, activity and inactivity!

How to watch the sense 'I am'  
Dear Snow,   
Sence of "I am" is what watches so called "you" all the time. Try to get rid  
of it and you will not succeed. When you are defeated in such a way, you'll  
see how to watch it.

dear rideforever you said   
" Please help me understand. You say do not try. .. so you mean do nothing ?  
Or are you saying do something subtle ?"**   
try as you like, it is ok to meditate, to make effort..but know that all  
effort is contraproductive as a mental concentration activity..   
what we look for is eternal, everpresent concioussness...and it is simply the  
arising of htis moment..not a big thing..just this   
now tell me Who creates thsi moment...if you found a personality who makes  
this moment   
then tell me next who sustains this moment?   
if you can find someone then show me a person who transcends this moment...   
oyu will never find anything apart from this moment...no sustainer no creator  
no destroyer   
it simply is...and no one is there to make this...yo effor tis senseless...but  
still we need to make effort daily   
its a paradox but a very gentle and loving paradox..so make effort, hard  
effort and then more and more subtle but know deeply understand deeply that it  
is for nothing because there is no one to achive enlightment, enlightment is  
allready (primordially) the nature of htis moment...it is self arising,  
spontanious samadhi   
you cannot reach it, you cannot miss it, you can not grasp it hold it or  
whatever...so best thing is to relax...

what we look for. ..

If you are looking or if you are relaxing, you are doing something.   
"Is there any meaning in wanting to be a jnani ?", or does enlightenment just  
happen ?   
"Is it possible to make an effort to be a jnani ?"   
"Why did Sri Ramana write a book about jnana ? reading a book is gaining a  
vasana"   
Yes, I think, wanting to be a jnana might have some value. I am not saying  
definitely, I am saying there is a possibility that it would help to want to  
be a jnana.   
The instruction "hold onto the I-feeling". This is a vasana. Can it help you  
? Perhaps.   
Perhaps if you have a small amount of wanting, a small amount of doing, it can  
take you 95% on the path, and then you give that up and you are pulled from  
the other side 5%.   
If you think that any effort is against jnana, then stop being a jnana. Stop  
relaxing. Stop looking. Forget it.

Bhagavan Ramana has said the following on the various points   
mentioned: 1. Desiring the Self is the only desire that one can have. If   
desire is meant as vasana, this is the only vasana that one can   
have.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana did write books, did have some thoughts,   
why only thoughts, He did have dreams too. He did drinking   
and sleeping. He has said that this is done by the Pure Mind   
or Suddha Manas, or Sattva Manas, which does not produce   
any prarabdha effect. It is from the Pure Mind, which is like   
the burnt rope. The burnt rope has only a form but of little   
use for any activity i.e. activity that we normally mean.   
He has also said that the Self does everything that a self realized   
jnani does. It is an advaitic paradox. Sri Sankara did all the work,   
including pilgrimages (which Bhagavan Ramana did not do) with   
this Pure Mind or the Self. It is said in Tamil - Ninaiyamal ninainthu...  
thinking without thinking, sollaamal solli. .. telling   
without telling.... kaanaamal kandu....seeing without seeing.   
It is like doing acitivity in a dream. He has said this to Maurice   
Frydman in one of His conversations.

This article which seems written by Maurice Frydman is actually yours, it has  
become yours when you have read it. Its again your thought. Like this all the  
various books written by various devotees are verily their own (your)  
thoughts.   
Is it not just a thought again? that Bhagawan had thoughts, dreams, ate, drank  
etc...? whose thoughts are these? Who is the 'I' to whom these thoughts arise?  
please see.   
They are all just thoughts.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Is eating and drinking also part of effort and one requires to refrain from  
them to "Just Be"?   
What do you say?   
I am trying to understand whether it can be classified as a thoughtful or  
thoughtless activity.

I am trying to understand whether it can be classified as a thoughtful or  
thoughtless activity.  
Why do you - 'I' want to know, whether eating and drinking also is part of  
effort and whether one has to refrain from them to "Just Be" \- please see,  
this very need is taking you - 'I' away from Just Being. This is what you -  
'I' \- Mind - Thought is doing. Questioning!   
Just for purposes of clarity, in a thoughtless (state) what matters to you -  
'I' ? why speculate about it now Thinking about it? what ever you think about  
it now, is going to be false as it falls in the realms of thoughts only!   
A honest answer thought can give is - "you - thought - 'I' will know answer  
for your question only in thought-less (state) {in reality you will never know  
for you - thoughts will never be there to know this answer}   
Ideally, Ramana Mahashi would say, first get to the thoughtless (state) and  
then ask this question.   
You - 'I' (as in - Thoughts) can never know Manonasham (state) what ever you  
know is just thought alone! Please see, it is you - 'I' \- Mind - thought that  
is just hungry for thinking - Thoughts, Mind just want to procreate for  
continuity for eternity.   
Please see, as I mentioned in other posts about the Sushupti (State), is there  
any hunger, thirst, life, Body, others, world, are you there? where are these  
questions about the effort and effortlessness, activity and inactivity!   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

How to watch the sense 'I am'  
Dear Snow,   
Sence of "I am" is what watches so called "you" all the time. Try to get rid  
of it and you will not succeed. When you are defeated in such a way, you'll  
see how to watch it.

dear rideforever you said   
" Please help me understand. You say do not try. .. so you mean do nothing ?  
Or are you saying do something subtle ?"**   
try as you like, it is ok to meditate, to make effort..but know that all  
effort is contraproductive as a mental concentration activity..   
what we look for is eternal, everpresent concioussness...and it is simply the  
arising of htis moment..not a big thing..just this   
now tell me Who creates thsi moment...if you found a personality who makes  
this moment   
then tell me next who sustains this moment?   
if you can find someone then show me a person who transcends this moment...   
oyu will never find anything apart from this moment...no sustainer no creator  
no destroyer   
it simply is...and no one is there to make this...yo effor tis senseless...but  
still we need to make effort daily   
its a paradox but a very gentle and loving paradox..so make effort, hard  
effort and then more and more subtle but know deeply understand deeply that it  
is for nothing because there is no one to achive enlightment, enlightment is  
allready (primordially) the nature of htis moment...it is self arising,  
spontanious samadhi   
you cannot reach it, you cannot miss it, you can not grasp it hold it or  
whatever...so best thing is to relax...

what we look for. ..

If you are looking or if you are relaxing, you are doing something.   
"Is there any meaning in wanting to be a jnani ?", or does enlightenment just  
happen ?   
"Is it possible to make an effort to be a jnani ?"   
"Why did Sri Ramana write a book about jnana ? reading a book is gaining a  
vasana"   
Yes, I think, wanting to be a jnana might have some value. I am not saying  
definitely, I am saying there is a possibility that it would help to want to  
be a jnana.   
The instruction "hold onto the I-feeling". This is a vasana. Can it help you  
? Perhaps.   
Perhaps if you have a small amount of wanting, a small amount of doing, it can  
take you 95% on the path, and then you give that up and you are pulled from  
the other side 5%.   
If you think that any effort is against jnana, then stop being a jnana. Stop  
relaxing. Stop looking. Forget it.

Bhagavan Ramana has said the following on the various points   
mentioned: 1. Desiring the Self is the only desire that one can have. If   
desire is meant as vasana, this is the only vasana that one can   
have.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana did write books, did have some thoughts,   
why only thoughts, He did have dreams too. He did drinking   
and sleeping. He has said that this is done by the Pure Mind   
or Suddha Manas, or Sattva Manas, which does not produce   
any prarabdha effect. It is from the Pure Mind, which is like   
the burnt rope. The burnt rope has only a form but of little   
use for any activity i.e. activity that we normally mean.   
He has also said that the Self does everything that a self realized   
jnani does. It is an advaitic paradox. Sri Sankara did all the work,   
including pilgrimages (which Bhagavan Ramana did not do) with   
this Pure Mind or the Self. It is said in Tamil - Ninaiyamal ninainthu...  
thinking without thinking, sollaamal solli. .. telling   
without telling.... kaanaamal kandu....seeing without seeing.   
It is like doing acitivity in a dream. He has said this to Maurice   
Frydman in one of His conversations.

This article which seems written by Maurice Frydman is actually yours, it has  
become yours when you have read it. Its again your thought. Like this all the  
various books written by various devotees are verily their own (your)  
thoughts.   
Is it not just a thought again? that Bhagawan had thoughts, dreams, ate, drank  
etc...? whose thoughts are these? Who is the 'I' to whom these thoughts arise?  
please see.   
They are all just thoughts.

1\. The moment one does something if its lost. .. than Ramana was doing so

2.what kind of self inquiry are you talking about Nagaraj?   
When a thought came. ..   
and you remembered that you have to question to whom it has come...   
the original thought is already over. the thought now is this remembrance.   
while the illusion is created as if you are killing the previous thought!!   
and if u did not remember, you cannot ask the question either.   
so u sit for just be. .. and the thought arose. .. it did not ask u permission  
to arise. it just arose.... and nothing can be done about it! u try it  
tomorrow. just sit. thought arises. when you remembered your self inquiry and

Dear I,   
Quote from: silentgreen on January 12, 2010, 01:13:29 PM  
Is eating and drinking also part of effort and one requires to refrain from  
them to "Just Be"?   
What do you say?   
I am trying to understand whether it can be classified as a thoughtful or  
thoughtless activity.  
Why do you - 'I' want to know, whether eating and drinking also is part of  
effort and whether one has to refrain from them to "Just Be" \- please see,  
this very need is taking you - 'I' away from Just Being. This is what you -  
'I' \- Mind - Thought is doing. Questioning!   
Just for purposes of clarity, in a thoughtless (state) what matters to you -  
'I' ? why speculate about it now Thinking about it? what ever you think about  
it now, is going to be false as it falls in the realms of thoughts only!   
A honest answer thought can give is - "you - thought - 'I' will know answer  
for your question only in thought-less (state) {in reality you will never know  
for you - thoughts will never be there to know this answer}   
Ideally, Ramana Mahashi would say, first get to the thoughtless (state) and  
then ask this question.   
You - 'I' (as in - Thoughts) can never know Manonasham (state) what ever you  
know is just thought alone! Please see, it is you - 'I' \- Mind - thought that  
is just hungry for thinking - Thoughts, Mind just want to procreate for  
continuity for eternity.   
Please see, as I mentioned in other posts about the Sushupti (State), is there  
any hunger, thirst, life, Body, others, world, are you there? where are these  
questions about the effort and effortlessness, activity and inactivity!

1\. The moment one does something if its lost. .. than Ramana was doing so  
many things! what do u intend to say?  
Why are you - Mind trying to know how Ramana was? is it of any help to you?  
You - Mind can never know Ramana. It is You - Mind - thoughts that is asking  
You - 'I' this questions - "than Ramana was doing so many things! what do u  
intend to say?" Please enquire who is the 'I' to whom this question has come!  
Who am 'I'   
Who is the one that saw Ramana doing so many things? He is to be enquired  
first! Who is Ramana and Who is the You - 'I' that saw Ramana doing so many  
things.   
More primarily, what is 'Doing'? What are 'Things', that you are talking  
about?   
And when you mentioned - "what do u intend to say?" Pleas tell me actually to  
whom are you asking this question? Who is the "u" in "what do **u** intend to  
say?"

When a thought came. ..

the original thought is already over. the thought now is this remembrance.   
while the illusion is created as if you are killing the previous thought!!

so u sit for just be. .. and the thought arose. .. it did not ask u permission

How to watch the sense 'I am'  
Dear Snow,   
Sence of "I am" is what watches so called "you" all the time. Try to get rid  
of it and you will not succeed. When you are defeated in such a way, you'll  
see how to watch it.

dear rideforever you said   
" Please help me understand. You say do not try. .. so you mean do nothing ?  
Or are you saying do something subtle ?"**   
try as you like, it is ok to meditate, to make effort..but know that all  
effort is contraproductive as a mental concentration activity..   
what we look for is eternal, everpresent concioussness...and it is simply the  
arising of htis moment..not a big thing..just this   
now tell me Who creates thsi moment...if you found a personality who makes  
this moment   
then tell me next who sustains this moment?   
if you can find someone then show me a person who transcends this moment...   
oyu will never find anything apart from this moment...no sustainer no creator  
no destroyer   
it simply is...and no one is there to make this...yo effor tis senseless...but  
still we need to make effort daily   
its a paradox but a very gentle and loving paradox..so make effort, hard  
effort and then more and more subtle but know deeply understand deeply that it  
is for nothing because there is no one to achive enlightment, enlightment is  
allready (primordially) the nature of htis moment...it is self arising,  
spontanious samadhi   
you cannot reach it, you cannot miss it, you can not grasp it hold it or  
whatever...so best thing is to relax...

what we look for. ..

If you are looking or if you are relaxing, you are doing something.   
"Is there any meaning in wanting to be a jnani ?", or does enlightenment just  
happen ?   
"Is it possible to make an effort to be a jnani ?"   
"Why did Sri Ramana write a book about jnana ? reading a book is gaining a  
vasana"   
Yes, I think, wanting to be a jnana might have some value. I am not saying  
definitely, I am saying there is a possibility that it would help to want to  
be a jnana.   
The instruction "hold onto the I-feeling". This is a vasana. Can it help you  
? Perhaps.   
Perhaps if you have a small amount of wanting, a small amount of doing, it can  
take you 95% on the path, and then you give that up and you are pulled from  
the other side 5%.   
If you think that any effort is against jnana, then stop being a jnana. Stop  
relaxing. Stop looking. Forget it.

Bhagavan Ramana has said the following on the various points   
mentioned: 1. Desiring the Self is the only desire that one can have. If   
desire is meant as vasana, this is the only vasana that one can   
have.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana did write books, did have some thoughts,   
why only thoughts, He did have dreams too. He did drinking   
and sleeping. He has said that this is done by the Pure Mind   
or Suddha Manas, or Sattva Manas, which does not produce   
any prarabdha effect. It is from the Pure Mind, which is like   
the burnt rope. The burnt rope has only a form but of little   
use for any activity i.e. activity that we normally mean.   
He has also said that the Self does everything that a self realized   
jnani does. It is an advaitic paradox. Sri Sankara did all the work,   
including pilgrimages (which Bhagavan Ramana did not do) with   
this Pure Mind or the Self. It is said in Tamil - Ninaiyamal ninainthu...  
thinking without thinking, sollaamal solli. .. telling   
without telling.... kaanaamal kandu....seeing without seeing.   
It is like doing acitivity in a dream. He has said this to Maurice   
Frydman in one of His conversations.   
Arunachala Siva.

This article which seems written by Maurice Frydman is actually yours, it has  
become yours when you have read it. Its again your thought. Like this all the  
various books written by various devotees are verily their own (your)  
thoughts.   
Is it not just a thought again? that Bhagawan had thoughts, dreams, ate, drank  
etc...? whose thoughts are these? Who is the 'I' to whom these thoughts arise?  
please see.   
They are all just thoughts.

1\. The moment one does something if its lost. .. than Ramana was doing so  
many things! what do u intend to say?  
Why are you - Mind trying to know how Ramana was? is it of any help to you?  
You - Mind can never know Ramana. It is You - Mind - thoughts that is asking  
You - 'I' this questions - "than Ramana was doing so many things! what do u  
intend to say?" Please enquire who is the 'I' to whom this question has come!  
Who am 'I'   
Who is the one that saw Ramana doing so many things? He is to be enquired  
first! Who is Ramana and Who is the You - 'I' that saw Ramana doing so many  
things.   
More primarily, what is 'Doing'? What are 'Things', that you are talking  
about?   
And when you mentioned - "what do u intend to say?" Pleas tell me actually to  
whom are you asking this question? Who is the "u" in "what do **u** intend to  
say?"   
Quote from: srkudai on January 12, 2010, 02:32:38 PM  
2.what kind of self inquiry are you talking about Nagaraj?   
When a thought came. ..   
and you remembered that you have to question to whom it has come...   
the original thought is already over. the thought now is this remembrance.   
while the illusion is created as if you are killing the previous thought!!   
and if u did not remember, you cannot ask the question either.   
so u sit for just be. .. and the thought arose. .. it did not ask u permission  
to arise. it just arose.... and nothing can be done about it! u try it  
tomorrow. just sit. thought arises. when you remembered your self inquiry and  
tried to use it to "resolve that thought". .. this remembrance is slow. by  
that time the thought has already passed away.   
infact the reason u r saying this always but not doing it is. .. u r not able  
to do it. .. coz its impractical!  
First, please tell me - You - 'I'(Please introspect), why the thought arised.  
Then we can look further!

How to watch the sense 'I am'  
Dear Snow,   
Sence of "I am" is what watches so called "you" all the time. Try to get rid  
of it and you will not succeed. When you are defeated in such a way, you'll  
see how to watch it.

dear rideforever you said   
" Please help me understand. You say do not try. .. so you mean do nothing ?  
Or are you saying do something subtle ?"**   
try as you like, it is ok to meditate, to make effort..but know that all  
effort is contraproductive as a mental concentration activity..   
what we look for is eternal, everpresent concioussness...and it is simply the  
arising of htis moment..not a big thing..just this   
now tell me Who creates thsi moment...if you found a personality who makes  
this moment   
then tell me next who sustains this moment?   
if you can find someone then show me a person who transcends this moment...   
oyu will never find anything apart from this moment...no sustainer no creator  
no destroyer   
it simply is...and no one is there to make this...yo effor tis senseless...but  
still we need to make effort daily   
its a paradox but a very gentle and loving paradox..so make effort, hard  
effort and then more and more subtle but know deeply understand deeply that it  
is for nothing because there is no one to achive enlightment, enlightment is  
allready (primordially) the nature of htis moment...it is self arising,  
spontanious samadhi   
you cannot reach it, you cannot miss it, you can not grasp it hold it or  
whatever...so best thing is to relax...

what we look for. ..

If you are looking or if you are relaxing, you are doing something.   
"Is there any meaning in wanting to be a jnani ?", or does enlightenment just  
happen ?   
"Is it possible to make an effort to be a jnani ?"   
"Why did Sri Ramana write a book about jnana ? reading a book is gaining a  
vasana"   
Yes, I think, wanting to be a jnana might have some value. I am not saying  
definitely, I am saying there is a possibility that it would help to want to  
be a jnana.   
The instruction "hold onto the I-feeling". This is a vasana. Can it help you  
? Perhaps.   
Perhaps if you have a small amount of wanting, a small amount of doing, it can  
take you 95% on the path, and then you give that up and you are pulled from  
the other side 5%.   
If you think that any effort is against jnana, then stop being a jnana. Stop  
relaxing. Stop looking. Forget it.

Bhagavan Ramana has said the following on the various points   
mentioned: 1. Desiring the Self is the only desire that one can have. If   
desire is meant as vasana, this is the only vasana that one can   
have.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana did write books, did have some thoughts,   
why only thoughts, He did have dreams too. He did drinking   
and sleeping. He has said that this is done by the Pure Mind   
or Suddha Manas, or Sattva Manas, which does not produce   
any prarabdha effect. It is from the Pure Mind, which is like   
the burnt rope. The burnt rope has only a form but of little   
use for any activity i.e. activity that we normally mean.   
He has also said that the Self does everything that a self realized   
jnani does. It is an advaitic paradox. Sri Sankara did all the work,   
including pilgrimages (which Bhagavan Ramana did not do) with   
this Pure Mind or the Self. It is said in Tamil - Ninaiyamal ninainthu...  
thinking without thinking, sollaamal solli. .. telling   
without telling.... kaanaamal kandu....seeing without seeing.   
It is like doing acitivity in a dream. He has said this to Maurice   
Frydman in one of His conversations.   
Arunachala Siva.

This article which seems written by Maurice Frydman is actually yours, it has  
become yours when you have read it. Its again your thought. Like this all the  
various books written by various devotees are verily their own (your)  
thoughts.   
Is it not just a thought again? that Bhagawan had thoughts, dreams, ate, drank  
etc...? whose thoughts are these? Who is the 'I' to whom these thoughts arise?  
please see.   
They are all just thoughts.

I am trying to understand whether it can be classified as a thoughtful or  
thoughtless activity.  
Why do you - 'I' want to know, whether eating and drinking also is part of  
effort and whether one has to refrain from them to "Just Be" \- please see,  
this very need is taking you - 'I' away from Just Being. This is what you -  
'I' \- Mind - Thought is doing. Questioning!   
Just for purposes of clarity, in a thoughtless (state) what matters to you -  
'I' ? why speculate about it now Thinking about it? what ever you think about  
it now, is going to be false as it falls in the realms of thoughts only!   
A honest answer thought can give is - "you - thought - 'I' will know answer  
for your question only in thought-less (state) {in reality you will never know  
for you - thoughts will never be there to know this answer}   
Ideally, Ramana Mahashi would say, first get to the thoughtless (state) and  
then ask this question.   
You - 'I' (as in - Thoughts) can never know Manonasham (state) what ever you  
know is just thought alone! Please see, it is you - 'I' \- Mind - thought that  
is just hungry for thinking - Thoughts, Mind just want to procreate for  
continuity for eternity.   
Please see, as I mentioned in other posts about the Sushupti (State), is there  
any hunger, thirst, life, Body, others, world, are you there? where are these  
questions about the effort and effortlessness, activity and inactivity!

Sence of "I am" is what watches so called "you" all the time. Try to get rid  
of it and you will not succeed. When you are defeated in such a way, you'll  
see how to watch it.

dear rideforever you said   
" Please help me understand. You say do not try. .. so you mean do nothing ?  
Or are you saying do something subtle ?"**   
try as you like, it is ok to meditate, to make effort..but know that all  
effort is contraproductive as a mental concentration activity..   
what we look for is eternal, everpresent concioussness...and it is simply the  
arising of htis moment..not a big thing..just this   
now tell me Who creates thsi moment...if you found a personality who makes  
this moment   
then tell me next who sustains this moment?   
if you can find someone then show me a person who transcends this moment...   
oyu will never find anything apart from this moment...no sustainer no creator  
no destroyer   
it simply is...and no one is there to make this...yo effor tis senseless...but  
still we need to make effort daily   
its a paradox but a very gentle and loving paradox..so make effort, hard  
effort and then more and more subtle but know deeply understand deeply that it  
is for nothing because there is no one to achive enlightment, enlightment is  
allready (primordially) the nature of htis moment...it is self arising,  
spontanious samadhi   
you cannot reach it, you cannot miss it, you can not grasp it hold it or  
whatever...so best thing is to relax...

If you are looking or if you are relaxing, you are doing something.   
"Is there any meaning in wanting to be a jnani ?", or does enlightenment just  
happen ?   
"Is it possible to make an effort to be a jnani ?"   
"Why did Sri Ramana write a book about jnana ? reading a book is gaining a  
vasana"   
Yes, I think, wanting to be a jnana might have some value. I am not saying  
definitely, I am saying there is a possibility that it would help to want to  
be a jnana.   
The instruction "hold onto the I-feeling". This is a vasana. Can it help you  
? Perhaps.   
Perhaps if you have a small amount of wanting, a small amount of doing, it can  
take you 95% on the path, and then you give that up and you are pulled from  
the other side 5%.   
If you think that any effort is against jnana, then stop being a jnana. Stop  
relaxing. Stop looking. Forget it.

Bhagavan Ramana has said the following on the various points   
mentioned: 1. Desiring the Self is the only desire that one can have. If   
desire is meant as vasana, this is the only vasana that one can   
have.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana did write books, did have some thoughts,   
why only thoughts, He did have dreams too. He did drinking   
and sleeping. He has said that this is done by the Pure Mind   
or Suddha Manas, or Sattva Manas, which does not produce   
any prarabdha effect. It is from the Pure Mind, which is like   
the burnt rope. The burnt rope has only a form but of little   
use for any activity i.e. activity that we normally mean.   
He has also said that the Self does everything that a self realized   
jnani does. It is an advaitic paradox. Sri Sankara did all the work,   
including pilgrimages (which Bhagavan Ramana did not do) with   
this Pure Mind or the Self. It is said in Tamil - Ninaiyamal ninainthu...  
thinking without thinking, sollaamal solli. .. telling   
without telling.... kaanaamal kandu....seeing without seeing.   
It is like doing acitivity in a dream. He has said this to Maurice   
Frydman in one of His conversations.   
Arunachala Siva.

This article which seems written by Maurice Frydman is actually yours, it has  
become yours when you have read it. Its again your thought. Like this all the  
various books written by various devotees are verily their own (your)  
thoughts.   
Is it not just a thought again? that Bhagawan had thoughts, dreams, ate, drank  
etc...? whose thoughts are these? Who is the 'I' to whom these thoughts arise?  
please see.   
They are all just thoughts.

also Nagaraj, its useless to keep telling this is thought, this is also

Dear Nagaraj,   
Is eating and drinking also part of effort and one requires to refrain from  
them to "Just Be"?   
What do you say?   
I am trying to understand whether it can be classified as a thoughtful or  
thoughtless activity.

1\. The moment one does something if its lost. .. than Ramana was doing so  
many things! what do u intend to say?   
2.what kind of self inquiry are you talking about Nagaraj?   
When a thought came. ..   
and you remembered that you have to question to whom it has come...   
the original thought is already over. the thought now is this remembrance.   
while the illusion is created as if you are killing the previous thought!!   
and if u did not remember, you cannot ask the question either.   
so u sit for just be. .. and the thought arose. .. it did not ask u permission  
to arise. it just arose.... and nothing can be done about it! u try it  
tomorrow. just sit. thought arises. when you remembered your self inquiry and  
tried to use it to "resolve that thought". .. this remembrance is slow. by  
that time the thought has already passed away.

I am trying to understand whether it can be classified as a thoughtful or  
thoughtless activity.  
Why do you - 'I' want to know, whether eating and drinking also is part of  
effort and whether one has to refrain from them to "Just Be" \- please see,  
this very need is taking you - 'I' away from Just Being. This is what you -  
'I' \- Mind - Thought is doing. Questioning!   
Just for purposes of clarity, in a thoughtless (state) what matters to you -  
'I' ? why speculate about it now Thinking about it? what ever you think about  
it now, is going to be false as it falls in the realms of thoughts only!   
A honest answer thought can give is - "you - thought - 'I' will know answer  
for your question only in thought-less (state) {in reality you will never know  
for you - thoughts will never be there to know this answer}   
Ideally, Ramana Mahashi would say, first get to the thoughtless (state) and  
then ask this question.   
You - 'I' (as in - Thoughts) can never know Manonasham (state) what ever you  
know is just thought alone! Please see, it is you - 'I' \- Mind - thought that  
is just hungry for thinking - Thoughts, Mind just want to procreate for  
continuity for eternity.   
Please see, as I mentioned in other posts about the Sushupti (State), is there  
any hunger, thirst, life, Body, others, world, are you there? where are these  
questions about the effort and effortlessness, activity and inactivity!

vasana"   
Yes, I think, wanting to be a jnana might have some value. I am not saying  
definitely, I am saying there is a possibility that it would help to want to  
be a jnana.   
The instruction "hold onto the I-feeling". This is a vasana. Can it help you  
? Perhaps.   
Perhaps if you have a small amount of wanting, a small amount of doing, it can  
take you 95% on the path, and then you give that up and you are pulled from  
the other side 5%.   
If you think that any effort is against jnana, then stop being a jnana. Stop  
relaxing. Stop looking. Forget it.

Bhagavan Ramana has said the following on the various points   
mentioned: 1. Desiring the Self is the only desire that one can have. If   
desire is meant as vasana, this is the only vasana that one can   
have.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana did write books, did have some thoughts,   
why only thoughts, He did have dreams too. He did drinking   
and sleeping. He has said that this is done by the Pure Mind   
or Suddha Manas, or Sattva Manas, which does not produce   
any prarabdha effect. It is from the Pure Mind, which is like   
the burnt rope. The burnt rope has only a form but of little   
use for any activity i.e. activity that we normally mean.   
He has also said that the Self does everything that a self realized   
jnani does. It is an advaitic paradox. Sri Sankara did all the work,   
including pilgrimages (which Bhagavan Ramana did not do) with   
this Pure Mind or the Self. It is said in Tamil - Ninaiyamal ninainthu...  
thinking without thinking, sollaamal solli. .. telling   
without telling.... kaanaamal kandu....seeing without seeing.   
It is like doing acitivity in a dream. He has said this to Maurice   
Frydman in one of His conversations.

This article which seems written by Maurice Frydman is actually yours, it has  
become yours when you have read it. Its again your thought. Like this all the  
various books written by various devotees are verily their own (your)  
thoughts.   
Is it not just a thought again? that Bhagawan had thoughts, dreams, ate, drank  
etc...? whose thoughts are these? Who is the 'I' to whom these thoughts arise?  
please see.   
They are all just thoughts.

Dear srkudai, Nagaraj,   
The sense of "I am" is simply experiencing. For seekers, they have   
to watch the sense of "I am". Thereafter, it is only experiencing   
not describable by thoughts and words and deeds. Bhagavan   
Ramana used to quote Saint Tayumanavar and another old song   
in this context.   
Tayumanavar: It is like a newly married girl, coming out of the nuptial room in   
the early morning. What shall she say about her experience?   
She will not talk or describe to anyone. Even to her mother who   
is waiting anxiously in the morning, she would simply give a small   
smile and rush to take bath! Imagine, a celibate saint poet has   
written this! A celibate Brahma Jnani has quoted this!   
The old song: (Which Devaraja Mudaliar quotes in his book   
"You are my mother and You are my father.": It is like a drunken fellow returning home at night. He does   
not know where his dhoti is, where is towel is, where his bed   
is. He does not want anything. He does not want even food.   
He simply wants to lie in bed with the experience.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear I,   
There is really no sense of experiencing "I am". it is simply being. It  
remains experience so long the Self enquiry continues till the mind/I merges  
where the perfect Self emerges as 'I-I'   
The example quoted by Ramana Maharshi is the first (stage) in what he says: "First the Self sees itself as object, then the Self sees itself as Void, and  
finally it sees itiself as Self, here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
Therefore,   
Experiencing the sense of "I am" is "First the Self sees itself as object"   
and   
in reality, "I am" is simply being - "and finally it sees itiself as Self,  
here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
Which is why I have always stressed in my other posts that Bhagawan's answers  
to several questions were tailor made as per the Pakva of the Questioneer.  
Those answers and Dialogues recorded as books should not be taken at face  
value as his answers to our same question. We have seen several instances  
where Bhagawan has responded differently for same questions. But His grace  
shall take care of the devotee all through!   
Salutations to Sri Ramana.

dear rideforever   
I can just answer from my point of view, wich is not accurate because Iam not  
a fully relaized beeing...you see I have the potential (lika all living  
beeings) some insights (like everybody in this forum) etc..but I feel the  
"I-knot" I sense it...some times more sometimes less...and I want behave like  
a teacher with a message and answer for your quesitons...I cannot do this   
but anyway as long as you feel to be bound by something, effort is  
neccessary...if you are totally confortabel with beeing bound then you are not  
longer in bondage (I guess), so as long as I have this feeling of bondage or  
seperation, I need to make effort..its natural...you may know that there is  
no-doer-that reality is the ever present **here and now** and no matter where  
oyu turn your attention to (sense object, inner feeling etc) all you find is  
blissfull open space..you may know, you may feel it but when the karmic jungle  
of thoughts can pull you out of htis "vision" then effor tis still important   
so thats I all I can say..and I know htat I want give oyu satisfactory  
answers....its not my job anyway

Quote from: snow on January 07, 2010, 03:06:33 PM  
Nisargadatta Maharaj said that it is very important to watch "I-am-ness" all  
the time.   
How is that possible?   
How can the subject watch the subject itself?  
Bhagavans explanation is given below -   
"First the Self sees itself as object, then the Self sees itself as Void, and  
finally it sees itiself as Self, here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
The subject is ego, ego first begins watching itself, ego watching ego, and as  
a result of such an enquiry ego ceases to exist and Self shines and when this  
(occurs) the Subject will not be there, the ego will not be there, the very  
need to know that you are the Self has to end.

Dear I,   
All interpretations and understanding are correct. There is no need for a  
confirmation from 'anothers' expereience, for understanding. For, it is  
ultimately only an acknowledgement for knowledge what one already has, thats  
all. If 'anothers' experience matches with our existing understanding, mind or  
the ego or the little 'I' nods in confirmation and at the same time, if the  
'anothers' experience does not matches with our existing understanding, mind  
or the ego or the little 'I' nods in non confirmation and this leads to  
discussions, etc... anhd the Mind - ego - little 'I' goes on discussing so  
long the so called 'another' confirms to its own existing or preconceived  
knowledge.   
The 'one' that wants knowledge is the ego, the knowledge that is being created  
in the process is also the ego's. The Mind some how wants to be acknowledged  
as a 'Jnani' or it wants to be acknowledged as a super consciousness, or it  
wants to just enjoy, relish having the title of "Self" or acknowledgement for  
having 'Self-Realised'   
So in all these, who is the one that is wanting to get 'realised'? it is the  
ego - mind - little 'I'. Its like, as a stage drama is being enacted, you act  
as 'Ravana' character and forget that you are just the actor, and as a  
character - 'Ravana' tries to realise its Self as 'Rama' \- which eventually  
becomes another character in itself. The ego - mind - little 'I' gets lost in  
the character of 'Ravana' tries so hard to realised its Self as 'Rama' instead  
of just casting away just the character of Ravana and remain as the one who  
performed the character.

Dear I,   
that means, like Krishna says in the Gita, Uddaret Atmanaatmaanam, the Self is  
its own friend and foe, one has to lift Himself from his own higher Self and  
not let itself fall from its own lower Self.   
Mis-interpretaions and mis understandings are biggest grace in themselves,  
they bestow higher grace than 'Knowledge' itself. It is only because of Mis-  
interpretaions and mis understandings that we begin to enquire further.   
More over it is only the Mind that distinguishes between Misunderstanding and  
Understanding.   
Meditation, for is just being aware of ones own ego, till it gets dissolved  
into nothingness or everything ness.   
Meditation is for me, "Chumma Iru", "Just being" Let all move around you, Just  
Be.   
Bhagavan says - "To know and not to think"

The non existent ego coming out of the non existent mind watches the Self.  
But   
in the beginning, it watches only the thoughts. In a thoughtless abandon, it  
watches   
the Self, in the sense it becomes the Self. The last stage, " watching the  
Self and   
being the Self" is through Guru's Grace. Bhagavan Ramana says in Sri  
Arunachala   
Akshara Mana Maalai: Do not show the mirror to this noseless person and makes  
him   
ashamed. Please lift me up and hug me. (AAMM 91)

Nice discussion.   
Nice points raised by subramanian garu,nagaraj garu and udai garu.   
I agree with subramanian garu regarding Suddha Manas,or Sattva Manas, which  
does not produce any prarabdha effect. Bhagavan Ramana did write books, did  
have some thoughts,why only thoughts, He did have dreams too.   
I agree with udai garu regarding we cannot have control over our thoughts and  
it is not like we desire and hence we have thoughts.   
Only because we cannot have control over our thoughts several techniques like  
breath control,self enquiry.... are mentioned.   
In Bhagavad Gita Ch6 Text35 Lord Krishna says,   
The Blessed Lord said: O mighty-armed son of Kunti, **it is undoubtedly very  
difficult to curb the restless mind, but it is possible by constant practice  
and by detachment.**   
Here detachment means having strong conviction that ' i am not the  
mind,body,senses...' which reminds Adi sankara's Nirvana Satakam poem.   
Once bhagavan said   
If the outlook changes, the troubles of the world will not worry us. Are the  
waves different from the ocean? Why do the waves occur at all? If asked, what  
reply can we give? The troubles in the world also are like that. Waves come  
and go. If it is found out that they are not different from Atma this worry  
will not exist.

Dear srkudai, Nagaraj,   
The sense of "I am" is simply experiencing. For seekers, they have   
to watch the sense of "I am". Thereafter, it is only experiencing   
not describable by thoughts and words and deeds. Bhagavan   
Ramana used to quote Saint Tayumanavar and another old song   
in this context.   
Tayumanavar: It is like a newly married girl, coming out of the nuptial room in   
the early morning. What shall she say about her experience?   
She will not talk or describe to anyone. Even to her mother who   
is waiting anxiously in the morning, she would simply give a small   
smile and rush to take bath! Imagine, a celibate saint poet has   
written this! A celibate Brahma Jnani has quoted this!   
The old song: (Which Devaraja Mudaliar quotes in his book   
"You are my mother and You are my father.": It is like a drunken fellow returning home at night. He does   
not know where his dhoti is, where is towel is, where his bed   
is. He does not want anything. He does not want even food.   
He simply wants to lie in bed with the experience.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear I,   
There is really no sense of experiencing "I am". it is simply being. It  
remains experience so long the Self enquiry continues till the mind/I merges  
where the perfect Self emerges as 'I-I'   
The example quoted by Ramana Maharshi is the first (stage) in what he says: "First the Self sees itself as object, then the Self sees itself as Void, and  
finally it sees itiself as Self, here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
Therefore,   
Experiencing the sense of "I am" is "First the Self sees itself as object"   
and   
in reality, "I am" is simply being - "and finally it sees itiself as Self,  
here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
Which is why I have always stressed in my other posts that Bhagawan's answers  
to several questions were tailor made as per the Pakva of the Questioneer.  
Those answers and Dialogues recorded as books should not be taken at face  
value as his answers to our same question. We have seen several instances  
where Bhagawan has responded differently for same questions. But His grace  
shall take care of the devotee all through!

dear rideforever   
I can just answer from my point of view, wich is not accurate because Iam not  
a fully relaized beeing...you see I have the potential (lika all living  
beeings) some insights (like everybody in this forum) etc..but I feel the  
"I-knot" I sense it...some times more sometimes less...and I want behave like  
a teacher with a message and answer for your quesitons...I cannot do this   
but anyway as long as you feel to be bound by something, effort is  
neccessary...if you are totally confortabel with beeing bound then you are not  
longer in bondage (I guess), so as long as I have this feeling of bondage or  
seperation, I need to make effort..its natural...you may know that there is  
no-doer-that reality is the ever present **here and now** and no matter where  
oyu turn your attention to (sense object, inner feeling etc) all you find is  
blissfull open space..you may know, you may feel it but when the karmic jungle  
of thoughts can pull you out of htis "vision" then effor tis still important   
so thats I all I can say..and I know htat I want give oyu satisfactory  
answers....its not my job anyway

Quote from: Akira on March 15, 2010, 04:14:41 PM  
Quote from: snow on January 07, 2010, 03:06:33 PM  
Nisargadatta Maharaj said that it is very important to watch "I-am-ness" all  
the time.   
How is that possible?   
How can the subject watch the subject itself?  
Bhagavans explanation is given below -   
"First the Self sees itself as object, then the Self sees itself as Void, and  
finally it sees itiself as Self, here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
The subject is ego, ego first begins watching itself, ego watching ego, and as  
a result of such an enquiry ego ceases to exist and Self shines and when this  
(occurs) the Subject will not be there, the ego will not be there, the very  
need to know that you are the Self has to end.

Dear I,   
All interpretations and understanding are correct. There is no need for a  
confirmation from 'anothers' expereience, for understanding. For, it is  
ultimately only an acknowledgement for knowledge what one already has, thats  
all. If 'anothers' experience matches with our existing understanding, mind or  
the ego or the little 'I' nods in confirmation and at the same time, if the  
'anothers' experience does not matches with our existing understanding, mind  
or the ego or the little 'I' nods in non confirmation and this leads to  
discussions, etc... anhd the Mind - ego - little 'I' goes on discussing so  
long the so called 'another' confirms to its own existing or preconceived  
knowledge.   
The 'one' that wants knowledge is the ego, the knowledge that is being created  
in the process is also the ego's. The Mind some how wants to be acknowledged  
as a 'Jnani' or it wants to be acknowledged as a super consciousness, or it  
wants to just enjoy, relish having the title of "Self" or acknowledgement for  
having 'Self-Realised'   
So in all these, who is the one that is wanting to get 'realised'? it is the  
ego - mind - little 'I'. Its like, as a stage drama is being enacted, you act  
as 'Ravana' character and forget that you are just the actor, and as a  
character - 'Ravana' tries to realise its Self as 'Rama' \- which eventually  
becomes another character in itself. The ego - mind - little 'I' gets lost in  
the character of 'Ravana' tries so hard to realised its Self as 'Rama' instead  
of just casting away just the character of Ravana and remain as the one who  
performed the character.

Dear I,   
that means, like Krishna says in the Gita, Uddaret Atmanaatmaanam, the Self is  
its own friend and foe, one has to lift Himself from his own higher Self and  
not let itself fall from its own lower Self.   
Mis-interpretaions and mis understandings are biggest grace in themselves,  
they bestow higher grace than 'Knowledge' itself. It is only because of Mis-  
interpretaions and mis understandings that we begin to enquire further.   
More over it is only the Mind that distinguishes between Misunderstanding and  
Understanding.   
Meditation, for is just being aware of ones own ego, till it gets dissolved  
into nothingness or everything ness.   
Meditation is for me, "Chumma Iru", "Just being" Let all move around you, Just  
Be.   
Bhagavan says - "To know and not to think"

Nisargadatta Maharaj said that it is very important to watch "I-am-ness" all

How is that possible?   
How can the subject watch the subject itself?  
Bhagavans explanation is given below -   
"First the Self sees itself as object, then the Self sees itself as Void, and  
finally it sees itiself as Self, here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
The subject is ego, ego first begins watching itself, ego watching ego, and as  
a result of such an enquiry ego ceases to exist and Self shines and when this  
(occurs) the Subject will not be there, the ego will not be there, the very  
need to know that you are the Self has to end.

Dear I,   
All interpretations and understanding are correct. There is no need for a  
confirmation from 'anothers' expereience, for understanding. For, it is  
ultimately only an acknowledgement for knowledge what one already has, thats  
all. If 'anothers' experience matches with our existing understanding, mind or  
the ego or the little 'I' nods in confirmation and at the same time, if the  
'anothers' experience does not matches with our existing understanding, mind  
or the ego or the little 'I' nods in non confirmation and this leads to  
discussions, etc... anhd the Mind - ego - little 'I' goes on discussing so  
long the so called 'another' confirms to its own existing or preconceived  
knowledge.   
The 'one' that wants knowledge is the ego, the knowledge that is being created  
in the process is also the ego's. The Mind some how wants to be acknowledged  
as a 'Jnani' or it wants to be acknowledged as a super consciousness, or it  
wants to just enjoy, relish having the title of "Self" or acknowledgement for  
having 'Self-Realised'   
So in all these, who is the one that is wanting to get 'realised'? it is the  
ego - mind - little 'I'. Its like, as a stage drama is being enacted, you act  
as 'Ravana' character and forget that you are just the actor, and as a  
character - 'Ravana' tries to realise its Self as 'Rama' \- which eventually  
becomes another character in itself. The ego - mind - little 'I' gets lost in  
the character of 'Ravana' tries so hard to realised its Self as 'Rama' instead  
of just casting away just the character of Ravana and remain as the one who  
performed the character.

Dear I,   
that means, like Krishna says in the Gita, Uddaret Atmanaatmaanam, the Self is  
its own friend and foe, one has to lift Himself from his own higher Self and  
not let itself fall from its own lower Self.   
Mis-interpretaions and mis understandings are biggest grace in themselves,  
they bestow higher grace than 'Knowledge' itself. It is only because of Mis-  
interpretaions and mis understandings that we begin to enquire further.   
More over it is only the Mind that distinguishes between Misunderstanding and  
Understanding.   
Meditation, for is just being aware of ones own ego, till it gets dissolved  
into nothingness or everything ness.   
Meditation is for me, "Chumma Iru", "Just being" Let all move around you, Just  
Be.

in the beginning, it watches only the thoughts. In a thoughtless abandon, it  
watches   
the Self, in the sense it becomes the Self. The last stage, " watching the

Nice discussion.   
Nice points raised by subramanian garu,nagaraj garu and udai garu.   
I agree with subramanian garu regarding Suddha Manas,or Sattva Manas, which  
does not produce any prarabdha effect. Bhagavan Ramana did write books, did  
have some thoughts,why only thoughts, He did have dreams too.   
I agree with udai garu regarding we cannot have control over our thoughts and  
it is not like we desire and hence we have thoughts.   
Only because we cannot have control over our thoughts several techniques like  
breath control,self enquiry.... are mentioned.   
In Bhagavad Gita Ch6 Text35 Lord Krishna says,   
The Blessed Lord said: O mighty-armed son of Kunti, **it is undoubtedly very  
difficult to curb the restless mind, but it is possible by constant practice  
and by detachment.**   
Here detachment means having strong conviction that ' i am not the  
mind,body,senses...' which reminds Adi sankara's Nirvana Satakam poem.   
Once bhagavan said   
If the outlook changes, the troubles of the world will not worry us. Are the  
waves different from the ocean? Why do the waves occur at all? If asked, what  
reply can we give? The troubles in the world also are like that. Waves come  
and go. If it is found out that they are not different from Atma this worry  
will not exist.

Dear srkudai, Nagaraj,   
The sense of "I am" is simply experiencing. For seekers, they have   
to watch the sense of "I am". Thereafter, it is only experiencing   
not describable by thoughts and words and deeds. Bhagavan   
Ramana used to quote Saint Tayumanavar and another old song   
in this context.   
Tayumanavar: It is like a newly married girl, coming out of the nuptial room in   
the early morning. What shall she say about her experience?   
She will not talk or describe to anyone. Even to her mother who   
is waiting anxiously in the morning, she would simply give a small   
smile and rush to take bath! Imagine, a celibate saint poet has   
written this! A celibate Brahma Jnani has quoted this!   
The old song: (Which Devaraja Mudaliar quotes in his book   
"You are my mother and You are my father.": It is like a drunken fellow returning home at night. He does   
not know where his dhoti is, where is towel is, where his bed   
is. He does not want anything. He does not want even food.   
He simply wants to lie in bed with the experience.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear I,   
There is really no sense of experiencing "I am". it is simply being. It  
remains experience so long the Self enquiry continues till the mind/I merges  
where the perfect Self emerges as 'I-I'   
The example quoted by Ramana Maharshi is the first (stage) in what he says: "First the Self sees itself as object, then the Self sees itself as Void, and  
finally it sees itiself as Self, here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
Therefore,   
Experiencing the sense of "I am" is "First the Self sees itself as object"   
and   
in reality, "I am" is simply being - "and finally it sees itiself as Self,  
here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
Which is why I have always stressed in my other posts that Bhagawan's answers  
to several questions were tailor made as per the Pakva of the Questioneer.  
Those answers and Dialogues recorded as books should not be taken at face  
value as his answers to our same question. We have seen several instances  
where Bhagawan has responded differently for same questions. But His grace  
shall take care of the devotee all through!   
Salutations to Sri Ramana.

Nice discussion.   
Nice points raised by subramanian garu,nagaraj garu and udai garu.   
I agree with subramanian garu regarding Suddha Manas,or Sattva Manas, which  
does not produce any prarabdha effect. Bhagavan Ramana did write books, did  
have some thoughts,why only thoughts, He did have dreams too.   
I agree with udai garu regarding we cannot have control over our thoughts and  
it is not like we desire and hence we have thoughts.   
Only because we cannot have control over our thoughts several techniques like  
breath control,self enquiry.... are mentioned.   
In Bhagavad Gita Ch6 Text35 Lord Krishna says,   
The Blessed Lord said: O mighty-armed son of Kunti, **it is undoubtedly very  
difficult to curb the restless mind, but it is possible by constant practice  
and by detachment.**   
Here detachment means having strong conviction that ' i am not the  
mind,body,senses...' which reminds Adi sankara's Nirvana Satakam poem.   
Once bhagavan said   
If the outlook changes, the troubles of the world will not worry us. Are the  
waves different from the ocean? Why do the waves occur at all? If asked, what  
reply can we give? The troubles in the world also are like that. Waves come  
and go. If it is found out that they are not different from Atma this worry  
will not exist.

Dear srkudai, Nagaraj,   
The sense of "I am" is simply experiencing. For seekers, they have   
to watch the sense of "I am". Thereafter, it is only experiencing   
not describable by thoughts and words and deeds. Bhagavan   
Ramana used to quote Saint Tayumanavar and another old song   
in this context.   
Tayumanavar: It is like a newly married girl, coming out of the nuptial room in   
the early morning. What shall she say about her experience?   
She will not talk or describe to anyone. Even to her mother who   
is waiting anxiously in the morning, she would simply give a small   
smile and rush to take bath! Imagine, a celibate saint poet has   
written this! A celibate Brahma Jnani has quoted this!   
The old song: (Which Devaraja Mudaliar quotes in his book   
"You are my mother and You are my father.": It is like a drunken fellow returning home at night. He does   
not know where his dhoti is, where is towel is, where his bed   
is. He does not want anything. He does not want even food.   
He simply wants to lie in bed with the experience.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear I,   
There is really no sense of experiencing "I am". it is simply being. It  
remains experience so long the Self enquiry continues till the mind/I merges  
where the perfect Self emerges as 'I-I'   
The example quoted by Ramana Maharshi is the first (stage) in what he says: "First the Self sees itself as object, then the Self sees itself as Void, and  
finally it sees itiself as Self, here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
Therefore,   
Experiencing the sense of "I am" is "First the Self sees itself as object"   
and   
in reality, "I am" is simply being - "and finally it sees itiself as Self,  
here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
Which is why I have always stressed in my other posts that Bhagawan's answers  
to several questions were tailor made as per the Pakva of the Questioneer.  
Those answers and Dialogues recorded as books should not be taken at face  
value as his answers to our same question. We have seen several instances  
where Bhagawan has responded differently for same questions. But His grace  
shall take care of the devotee all through!   
Salutations to Sri Ramana.

dear rideforever   
I can just answer from my point of view, wich is not accurate because Iam not  
a fully relaized beeing...you see I have the potential (lika all living  
beeings) some insights (like everybody in this forum) etc..but I feel the  
"I-knot" I sense it...some times more sometimes less...and I want behave like  
a teacher with a message and answer for your quesitons...I cannot do this   
but anyway as long as you feel to be bound by something, effort is  
neccessary...if you are totally confortabel with beeing bound then you are not  
longer in bondage (I guess), so as long as I have this feeling of bondage or  
seperation, I need to make effort..its natural...you may know that there is  
no-doer-that reality is the ever present **here and now** and no matter where  
oyu turn your attention to (sense object, inner feeling etc) all you find is  
blissfull open space..you may know, you may feel it but when the karmic jungle  
of thoughts can pull you out of htis "vision" then effor tis still important   
so thats I all I can say..and I know htat I want give oyu satisfactory  
answers....its not my job anyway

Quote from: Akira on March 15, 2010, 04:14:41 PM  
Quote from: snow on January 07, 2010, 03:06:33 PM  
Nisargadatta Maharaj said that it is very important to watch "I-am-ness" all  
the time.   
How is that possible?   
How can the subject watch the subject itself?  
Bhagavans explanation is given below -   
"First the Self sees itself as object, then the Self sees itself as Void, and  
finally it sees itiself as Self, here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
The subject is ego, ego first begins watching itself, ego watching ego, and as  
a result of such an enquiry ego ceases to exist and Self shines and when this  
(occurs) the Subject will not be there, the ego will not be there, the very  
need to know that you are the Self has to end.

Dear I,   
All interpretations and understanding are correct. There is no need for a  
confirmation from 'anothers' expereience, for understanding. For, it is  
ultimately only an acknowledgement for knowledge what one already has, thats  
all. If 'anothers' experience matches with our existing understanding, mind or  
the ego or the little 'I' nods in confirmation and at the same time, if the  
'anothers' experience does not matches with our existing understanding, mind  
or the ego or the little 'I' nods in non confirmation and this leads to  
discussions, etc... anhd the Mind - ego - little 'I' goes on discussing so  
long the so called 'another' confirms to its own existing or preconceived  
knowledge.   
The 'one' that wants knowledge is the ego, the knowledge that is being created  
in the process is also the ego's. The Mind some how wants to be acknowledged  
as a 'Jnani' or it wants to be acknowledged as a super consciousness, or it  
wants to just enjoy, relish having the title of "Self" or acknowledgement for  
having 'Self-Realised'   
So in all these, who is the one that is wanting to get 'realised'? it is the  
ego - mind - little 'I'. Its like, as a stage drama is being enacted, you act  
as 'Ravana' character and forget that you are just the actor, and as a  
character - 'Ravana' tries to realise its Self as 'Rama' \- which eventually  
becomes another character in itself. The ego - mind - little 'I' gets lost in  
the character of 'Ravana' tries so hard to realised its Self as 'Rama' instead  
of just casting away just the character of Ravana and remain as the one who  
performed the character.

Dear I,   
that means, like Krishna says in the Gita, Uddaret Atmanaatmaanam, the Self is  
its own friend and foe, one has to lift Himself from his own higher Self and  
not let itself fall from its own lower Self.   
Mis-interpretaions and mis understandings are biggest grace in themselves,  
they bestow higher grace than 'Knowledge' itself. It is only because of Mis-  
interpretaions and mis understandings that we begin to enquire further.   
More over it is only the Mind that distinguishes between Misunderstanding and  
Understanding.   
Meditation, for is just being aware of ones own ego, till it gets dissolved  
into nothingness or everything ness.   
Meditation is for me, "Chumma Iru", "Just being" Let all move around you, Just  
Be.   
Bhagavan says - "To know and not to think"

The non existent ego coming out of the non existent mind watches the Self.  
But   
in the beginning, it watches only the thoughts. In a thoughtless abandon, it  
watches   
the Self, in the sense it becomes the Self. The last stage, " watching the  
Self and   
being the Self" is through Guru's Grace. Bhagavan Ramana says in Sri

Nisargadatta Maharaj said that it is very important to watch "I-am-ness" all  
the time.   
How is that possible?   
How can the subject watch the subject itself?  
Bhagavans explanation is given below -   
"First the Self sees itself as object, then the Self sees itself as Void, and  
finally it sees itiself as Self, here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
The subject is ego, ego first begins watching itself, ego watching ego, and as  
a result of such an enquiry ego ceases to exist and Self shines and when this  
(occurs) the Subject will not be there, the ego will not be there, the very  
need to know that you are the Self has to end.

Dear I,   
All interpretations and understanding are correct. There is no need for a  
confirmation from 'anothers' expereience, for understanding. For, it is  
ultimately only an acknowledgement for knowledge what one already has, thats  
all. If 'anothers' experience matches with our existing understanding, mind or  
the ego or the little 'I' nods in confirmation and at the same time, if the  
'anothers' experience does not matches with our existing understanding, mind  
or the ego or the little 'I' nods in non confirmation and this leads to  
discussions, etc... anhd the Mind - ego - little 'I' goes on discussing so  
long the so called 'another' confirms to its own existing or preconceived  
knowledge.   
The 'one' that wants knowledge is the ego, the knowledge that is being created  
in the process is also the ego's. The Mind some how wants to be acknowledged  
as a 'Jnani' or it wants to be acknowledged as a super consciousness, or it  
wants to just enjoy, relish having the title of "Self" or acknowledgement for  
having 'Self-Realised'   
So in all these, who is the one that is wanting to get 'realised'? it is the  
ego - mind - little 'I'. Its like, as a stage drama is being enacted, you act  
as 'Ravana' character and forget that you are just the actor, and as a  
character - 'Ravana' tries to realise its Self as 'Rama' \- which eventually  
becomes another character in itself. The ego - mind - little 'I' gets lost in  
the character of 'Ravana' tries so hard to realised its Self as 'Rama' instead  
of just casting away just the character of Ravana and remain as the one who  
performed the character.

Dear I,   
that means, like Krishna says in the Gita, Uddaret Atmanaatmaanam, the Self is  
its own friend and foe, one has to lift Himself from his own higher Self and  
not let itself fall from its own lower Self.   
Mis-interpretaions and mis understandings are biggest grace in themselves,  
they bestow higher grace than 'Knowledge' itself. It is only because of Mis-  
interpretaions and mis understandings that we begin to enquire further.   
More over it is only the Mind that distinguishes between Misunderstanding and  
Understanding.   
Meditation, for is just being aware of ones own ego, till it gets dissolved  
into nothingness or everything ness.   
Meditation is for me, "Chumma Iru", "Just being" Let all move around you, Just  
Be.

Nice discussion.   
Nice points raised by subramanian garu,nagaraj garu and udai garu.   
I agree with subramanian garu regarding Suddha Manas,or Sattva Manas, which  
does not produce any prarabdha effect. Bhagavan Ramana did write books, did  
have some thoughts,why only thoughts, He did have dreams too.   
I agree with udai garu regarding we cannot have control over our thoughts and  
it is not like we desire and hence we have thoughts.   
Only because we cannot have control over our thoughts several techniques like  
breath control,self enquiry.... are mentioned.   
In Bhagavad Gita Ch6 Text35 Lord Krishna says,   
The Blessed Lord said: O mighty-armed son of Kunti, **it is undoubtedly very  
difficult to curb the restless mind, but it is possible by constant practice  
and by detachment.**   
Here detachment means having strong conviction that ' i am not the  
mind,body,senses...' which reminds Adi sankara's Nirvana Satakam poem.   
Once bhagavan said   
If the outlook changes, the troubles of the world will not worry us. Are the  
waves different from the ocean? Why do the waves occur at all? If asked, what  
reply can we give? The troubles in the world also are like that. Waves come  
and go. If it is found out that they are not different from Atma this worry  
will not exist.

Dear srkudai, Nagaraj,   
The sense of "I am" is simply experiencing. For seekers, they have   
to watch the sense of "I am". Thereafter, it is only experiencing   
not describable by thoughts and words and deeds. Bhagavan   
Ramana used to quote Saint Tayumanavar and another old song   
in this context.   
Tayumanavar: It is like a newly married girl, coming out of the nuptial room in   
the early morning. What shall she say about her experience?   
She will not talk or describe to anyone. Even to her mother who   
is waiting anxiously in the morning, she would simply give a small   
smile and rush to take bath! Imagine, a celibate saint poet has   
written this! A celibate Brahma Jnani has quoted this!   
The old song: (Which Devaraja Mudaliar quotes in his book   
"You are my mother and You are my father.": It is like a drunken fellow returning home at night. He does   
not know where his dhoti is, where is towel is, where his bed   
is. He does not want anything. He does not want even food.   
He simply wants to lie in bed with the experience.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear I,   
There is really no sense of experiencing "I am". it is simply being. It  
remains experience so long the Self enquiry continues till the mind/I merges  
where the perfect Self emerges as 'I-I'   
The example quoted by Ramana Maharshi is the first (stage) in what he says: "First the Self sees itself as object, then the Self sees itself as Void, and  
finally it sees itiself as Self, here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
Therefore,   
Experiencing the sense of "I am" is "First the Self sees itself as object"   
and   
in reality, "I am" is simply being - "and finally it sees itiself as Self,  
here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
Which is why I have always stressed in my other posts that Bhagawan's answers  
to several questions were tailor made as per the Pakva of the Questioneer.  
Those answers and Dialogues recorded as books should not be taken at face  
value as his answers to our same question. We have seen several instances  
where Bhagawan has responded differently for same questions. But His grace  
shall take care of the devotee all through!   
Salutations to Sri Ramana.

Nice discussion.   
Nice points raised by subramanian garu,nagaraj garu and udai garu.   
I agree with subramanian garu regarding Suddha Manas,or Sattva Manas, which  
does not produce any prarabdha effect. Bhagavan Ramana did write books, did  
have some thoughts,why only thoughts, He did have dreams too.   
I agree with udai garu regarding we cannot have control over our thoughts and  
it is not like we desire and hence we have thoughts.   
Only because we cannot have control over our thoughts several techniques like  
breath control,self enquiry.... are mentioned.   
In Bhagavad Gita Ch6 Text35 Lord Krishna says,   
The Blessed Lord said: O mighty-armed son of Kunti, **it is undoubtedly very  
difficult to curb the restless mind, but it is possible by constant practice  
and by detachment.**   
Here detachment means having strong conviction that ' i am not the  
mind,body,senses...' which reminds Adi sankara's Nirvana Satakam poem.   
Once bhagavan said   
If the outlook changes, the troubles of the world will not worry us. Are the  
waves different from the ocean? Why do the waves occur at all? If asked, what  
reply can we give? The troubles in the world also are like that. Waves come  
and go. If it is found out that they are not different from Atma this worry  
will not exist.

Dear srkudai, Nagaraj,   
The sense of "I am" is simply experiencing. For seekers, they have   
to watch the sense of "I am". Thereafter, it is only experiencing   
not describable by thoughts and words and deeds. Bhagavan   
Ramana used to quote Saint Tayumanavar and another old song   
in this context.   
Tayumanavar: It is like a newly married girl, coming out of the nuptial room in   
the early morning. What shall she say about her experience?   
She will not talk or describe to anyone. Even to her mother who   
is waiting anxiously in the morning, she would simply give a small   
smile and rush to take bath! Imagine, a celibate saint poet has   
written this! A celibate Brahma Jnani has quoted this!   
The old song: (Which Devaraja Mudaliar quotes in his book   
"You are my mother and You are my father.": It is like a drunken fellow returning home at night. He does   
not know where his dhoti is, where is towel is, where his bed   
is. He does not want anything. He does not want even food.   
He simply wants to lie in bed with the experience.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear I,   
There is really no sense of experiencing "I am". it is simply being. It  
remains experience so long the Self enquiry continues till the mind/I merges  
where the perfect Self emerges as 'I-I'   
The example quoted by Ramana Maharshi is the first (stage) in what he says: "First the Self sees itself as object, then the Self sees itself as Void, and  
finally it sees itiself as Self, here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
Therefore,   
Experiencing the sense of "I am" is "First the Self sees itself as object"   
and   
in reality, "I am" is simply being - "and finally it sees itiself as Self,  
here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
Which is why I have always stressed in my other posts that Bhagawan's answers  
to several questions were tailor made as per the Pakva of the Questioneer.  
Those answers and Dialogues recorded as books should not be taken at face  
value as his answers to our same question. We have seen several instances  
where Bhagawan has responded differently for same questions. But His grace  
shall take care of the devotee all through!   
Salutations to Sri Ramana.

dear rideforever   
I can just answer from my point of view, wich is not accurate because Iam not  
a fully relaized beeing...you see I have the potential (lika all living  
beeings) some insights (like everybody in this forum) etc..but I feel the  
"I-knot" I sense it...some times more sometimes less...and I want behave like  
a teacher with a message and answer for your quesitons...I cannot do this   
but anyway as long as you feel to be bound by something, effort is  
neccessary...if you are totally confortabel with beeing bound then you are not  
longer in bondage (I guess), so as long as I have this feeling of bondage or  
seperation, I need to make effort..its natural...you may know that there is  
no-doer-that reality is the ever present **here and now** and no matter where  
oyu turn your attention to (sense object, inner feeling etc) all you find is  
blissfull open space..you may know, you may feel it but when the karmic jungle  
of thoughts can pull you out of htis "vision" then effor tis still important   
so thats I all I can say..and I know htat I want give oyu satisfactory  
answers....its not my job anyway

Quote from: Akira on March 15, 2010, 04:14:41 PM  
Quote from: snow on January 07, 2010, 03:06:33 PM  
Nisargadatta Maharaj said that it is very important to watch "I-am-ness" all  
the time.   
How is that possible?   
How can the subject watch the subject itself?  
Bhagavans explanation is given below -   
"First the Self sees itself as object, then the Self sees itself as Void, and  
finally it sees itiself as Self, here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
The subject is ego, ego first begins watching itself, ego watching ego, and as  
a result of such an enquiry ego ceases to exist and Self shines and when this  
(occurs) the Subject will not be there, the ego will not be there, the very  
need to know that you are the Self has to end.

Dear I,   
All interpretations and understanding are correct. There is no need for a  
confirmation from 'anothers' expereience, for understanding. For, it is  
ultimately only an acknowledgement for knowledge what one already has, thats  
all. If 'anothers' experience matches with our existing understanding, mind or  
the ego or the little 'I' nods in confirmation and at the same time, if the  
'anothers' experience does not matches with our existing understanding, mind  
or the ego or the little 'I' nods in non confirmation and this leads to  
discussions, etc... anhd the Mind - ego - little 'I' goes on discussing so  
long the so called 'another' confirms to its own existing or preconceived  
knowledge.   
The 'one' that wants knowledge is the ego, the knowledge that is being created  
in the process is also the ego's. The Mind some how wants to be acknowledged  
as a 'Jnani' or it wants to be acknowledged as a super consciousness, or it  
wants to just enjoy, relish having the title of "Self" or acknowledgement for  
having 'Self-Realised'   
So in all these, who is the one that is wanting to get 'realised'? it is the  
ego - mind - little 'I'. Its like, as a stage drama is being enacted, you act  
as 'Ravana' character and forget that you are just the actor, and as a  
character - 'Ravana' tries to realise its Self as 'Rama' \- which eventually  
becomes another character in itself. The ego - mind - little 'I' gets lost in  
the character of 'Ravana' tries so hard to realised its Self as 'Rama' instead  
of just casting away just the character of Ravana and remain as the one who  
performed the character.

Dear I,   
that means, like Krishna says in the Gita, Uddaret Atmanaatmaanam, the Self is  
its own friend and foe, one has to lift Himself from his own higher Self and  
not let itself fall from its own lower Self.   
Mis-interpretaions and mis understandings are biggest grace in themselves,  
they bestow higher grace than 'Knowledge' itself. It is only because of Mis-  
interpretaions and mis understandings that we begin to enquire further.   
More over it is only the Mind that distinguishes between Misunderstanding and  
Understanding.   
Meditation, for is just being aware of ones own ego, till it gets dissolved  
into nothingness or everything ness.   
Meditation is for me, "Chumma Iru", "Just being" Let all move around you, Just  
Be.   
Bhagavan says - "To know and not to think"

The non existent ego coming out of the non existent mind watches the Self.  
But   
in the beginning, it watches only the thoughts. In a thoughtless abandon, it  
watches   
the Self, in the sense it becomes the Self. The last stage, " watching the  
Self and   
being the Self" is through Guru's Grace. Bhagavan Ramana says in Sri  
Arunachala   
Akshara Mana Maalai: Do not show the mirror to this noseless person and makes  
him   
ashamed. Please lift me up and hug me. (AAMM 91)   
Arunachala Siva.

a fully relaized beeing...you see I have the potential (lika all living  
beeings) some insights (like everybody in this forum) etc..but I feel the  
"I-knot" I sense it...some times more sometimes less...and I want behave like  
a teacher with a message and answer for your quesitons...I cannot do this   
but anyway as long as you feel to be bound by something, effort is  
neccessary...if you are totally confortabel with beeing bound then you are not  
longer in bondage (I guess), so as long as I have this feeling of bondage or  
seperation, I need to make effort..its natural...you may know that there is  
no-doer-that reality is the ever present **here and now** and no matter where  
oyu turn your attention to (sense object, inner feeling etc) all you find is  
blissfull open space..you may know, you may feel it but when the karmic jungle  
of thoughts can pull you out of htis "vision" then effor tis still important   
so thats I all I can say..and I know htat I want give oyu satisfactory

Quote from: snow on January 07, 2010, 03:06:33 PM  
Nisargadatta Maharaj said that it is very important to watch "I-am-ness" all  
the time.   
How is that possible?   
How can the subject watch the subject itself?  
Bhagavans explanation is given below -   
"First the Self sees itself as object, then the Self sees itself as Void, and  
finally it sees itiself as Self, here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
The subject is ego, ego first begins watching itself, ego watching ego, and as  
a result of such an enquiry ego ceases to exist and Self shines and when this  
(occurs) the Subject will not be there, the ego will not be there, the very  
need to know that you are the Self has to end.

Dear I,   
All interpretations and understanding are correct. There is no need for a  
confirmation from 'anothers' expereience, for understanding. For, it is  
ultimately only an acknowledgement for knowledge what one already has, thats  
all. If 'anothers' experience matches with our existing understanding, mind or  
the ego or the little 'I' nods in confirmation and at the same time, if the  
'anothers' experience does not matches with our existing understanding, mind  
or the ego or the little 'I' nods in non confirmation and this leads to  
discussions, etc... anhd the Mind - ego - little 'I' goes on discussing so  
long the so called 'another' confirms to its own existing or preconceived  
knowledge.   
The 'one' that wants knowledge is the ego, the knowledge that is being created  
in the process is also the ego's. The Mind some how wants to be acknowledged  
as a 'Jnani' or it wants to be acknowledged as a super consciousness, or it  
wants to just enjoy, relish having the title of "Self" or acknowledgement for  
having 'Self-Realised'   
So in all these, who is the one that is wanting to get 'realised'? it is the  
ego - mind - little 'I'. Its like, as a stage drama is being enacted, you act  
as 'Ravana' character and forget that you are just the actor, and as a  
character - 'Ravana' tries to realise its Self as 'Rama' \- which eventually  
becomes another character in itself. The ego - mind - little 'I' gets lost in  
the character of 'Ravana' tries so hard to realised its Self as 'Rama' instead  
of just casting away just the character of Ravana and remain as the one who  
performed the character.

Dear I,   
that means, like Krishna says in the Gita, Uddaret Atmanaatmaanam, the Self is  
its own friend and foe, one has to lift Himself from his own higher Self and  
not let itself fall from its own lower Self.   
Mis-interpretaions and mis understandings are biggest grace in themselves,  
they bestow higher grace than 'Knowledge' itself. It is only because of Mis-  
interpretaions and mis understandings that we begin to enquire further.   
More over it is only the Mind that distinguishes between Misunderstanding and  
Understanding.   
Meditation, for is just being aware of ones own ego, till it gets dissolved  
into nothingness or everything ness.   
Meditation is for me, "Chumma Iru", "Just being" Let all move around you, Just  
Be.

Nice discussion.   
Nice points raised by subramanian garu,nagaraj garu and udai garu.   
I agree with subramanian garu regarding Suddha Manas,or Sattva Manas, which  
does not produce any prarabdha effect. Bhagavan Ramana did write books, did  
have some thoughts,why only thoughts, He did have dreams too.   
I agree with udai garu regarding we cannot have control over our thoughts and  
it is not like we desire and hence we have thoughts.   
Only because we cannot have control over our thoughts several techniques like  
breath control,self enquiry.... are mentioned.   
In Bhagavad Gita Ch6 Text35 Lord Krishna says,   
The Blessed Lord said: O mighty-armed son of Kunti, **it is undoubtedly very  
difficult to curb the restless mind, but it is possible by constant practice  
and by detachment.**   
Here detachment means having strong conviction that ' i am not the  
mind,body,senses...' which reminds Adi sankara's Nirvana Satakam poem.   
Once bhagavan said   
If the outlook changes, the troubles of the world will not worry us. Are the  
waves different from the ocean? Why do the waves occur at all? If asked, what  
reply can we give? The troubles in the world also are like that. Waves come  
and go. If it is found out that they are not different from Atma this worry  
will not exist.

Dear srkudai, Nagaraj,   
The sense of "I am" is simply experiencing. For seekers, they have   
to watch the sense of "I am". Thereafter, it is only experiencing   
not describable by thoughts and words and deeds. Bhagavan   
Ramana used to quote Saint Tayumanavar and another old song   
in this context.   
Tayumanavar: It is like a newly married girl, coming out of the nuptial room in   
the early morning. What shall she say about her experience?   
She will not talk or describe to anyone. Even to her mother who   
is waiting anxiously in the morning, she would simply give a small   
smile and rush to take bath! Imagine, a celibate saint poet has   
written this! A celibate Brahma Jnani has quoted this!   
The old song: (Which Devaraja Mudaliar quotes in his book   
"You are my mother and You are my father.": It is like a drunken fellow returning home at night. He does   
not know where his dhoti is, where is towel is, where his bed   
is. He does not want anything. He does not want even food.   
He simply wants to lie in bed with the experience.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear I,   
There is really no sense of experiencing "I am". it is simply being. It  
remains experience so long the Self enquiry continues till the mind/I merges  
where the perfect Self emerges as 'I-I'   
The example quoted by Ramana Maharshi is the first (stage) in what he says: "First the Self sees itself as object, then the Self sees itself as Void, and  
finally it sees itiself as Self, here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
Therefore,   
Experiencing the sense of "I am" is "First the Self sees itself as object"   
and   
in reality, "I am" is simply being - "and finally it sees itiself as Self,  
here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
Which is why I have always stressed in my other posts that Bhagawan's answers  
to several questions were tailor made as per the Pakva of the Questioneer.  
Those answers and Dialogues recorded as books should not be taken at face  
value as his answers to our same question. We have seen several instances  
where Bhagawan has responded differently for same questions. But His grace  
shall take care of the devotee all through!   
Salutations to Sri Ramana.

it is not like we desire and hence we have thoughts.   
Only because we cannot have control over our thoughts several techniques like  
breath control,self enquiry.... are mentioned.   
In Bhagavad Gita Ch6 Text35 Lord Krishna says,   
The Blessed Lord said: O mighty-armed son of Kunti, **it is undoubtedly very  
difficult to curb the restless mind, but it is possible by constant practice  
and by detachment.**   
Here detachment means having strong conviction that ' i am not the  
mind,body,senses...' which reminds Adi sankara's Nirvana Satakam poem.   
Once bhagavan said   
If the outlook changes, the troubles of the world will not worry us. Are the  
waves different from the ocean? Why do the waves occur at all? If asked, what  
reply can we give? The troubles in the world also are like that. Waves come  
and go. If it is found out that they are not different from Atma this worry  
will not exist.

Dear srkudai, Nagaraj,   
The sense of "I am" is simply experiencing. For seekers, they have   
to watch the sense of "I am". Thereafter, it is only experiencing   
not describable by thoughts and words and deeds. Bhagavan   
Ramana used to quote Saint Tayumanavar and another old song   
in this context.   
Tayumanavar: It is like a newly married girl, coming out of the nuptial room in   
the early morning. What shall she say about her experience?   
She will not talk or describe to anyone. Even to her mother who   
is waiting anxiously in the morning, she would simply give a small   
smile and rush to take bath! Imagine, a celibate saint poet has   
written this! A celibate Brahma Jnani has quoted this!   
The old song: (Which Devaraja Mudaliar quotes in his book   
"You are my mother and You are my father.": It is like a drunken fellow returning home at night. He does   
not know where his dhoti is, where is towel is, where his bed   
is. He does not want anything. He does not want even food.   
He simply wants to lie in bed with the experience.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear I,   
There is really no sense of experiencing "I am". it is simply being. It  
remains experience so long the Self enquiry continues till the mind/I merges  
where the perfect Self emerges as 'I-I'   
The example quoted by Ramana Maharshi is the first (stage) in what he says: "First the Self sees itself as object, then the Self sees itself as Void, and  
finally it sees itiself as Self, here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
Therefore,   
Experiencing the sense of "I am" is "First the Self sees itself as object"   
and   
in reality, "I am" is simply being - "and finally it sees itiself as Self,  
here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
Which is why I have always stressed in my other posts that Bhagawan's answers  
to several questions were tailor made as per the Pakva of the Questioneer.  
Those answers and Dialogues recorded as books should not be taken at face  
value as his answers to our same question. We have seen several instances  
where Bhagawan has responded differently for same questions. But His grace  
shall take care of the devotee all through!   
Salutations to Sri Ramana.

dear rideforever   
I can just answer from my point of view, wich is not accurate because Iam not  
a fully relaized beeing...you see I have the potential (lika all living  
beeings) some insights (like everybody in this forum) etc..but I feel the  
"I-knot" I sense it...some times more sometimes less...and I want behave like  
a teacher with a message and answer for your quesitons...I cannot do this   
but anyway as long as you feel to be bound by something, effort is  
neccessary...if you are totally confortabel with beeing bound then you are not  
longer in bondage (I guess), so as long as I have this feeling of bondage or  
seperation, I need to make effort..its natural...you may know that there is  
no-doer-that reality is the ever present **here and now** and no matter where  
oyu turn your attention to (sense object, inner feeling etc) all you find is  
blissfull open space..you may know, you may feel it but when the karmic jungle  
of thoughts can pull you out of htis "vision" then effor tis still important   
so thats I all I can say..and I know htat I want give oyu satisfactory  
answers....its not my job anyway

Quote from: Akira on March 15, 2010, 04:14:41 PM  
Quote from: snow on January 07, 2010, 03:06:33 PM  
Nisargadatta Maharaj said that it is very important to watch "I-am-ness" all  
the time.   
How is that possible?   
How can the subject watch the subject itself?  
Bhagavans explanation is given below -   
"First the Self sees itself as object, then the Self sees itself as Void, and  
finally it sees itiself as Self, here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
The subject is ego, ego first begins watching itself, ego watching ego, and as  
a result of such an enquiry ego ceases to exist and Self shines and when this  
(occurs) the Subject will not be there, the ego will not be there, the very  
need to know that you are the Self has to end.

Dear I,   
All interpretations and understanding are correct. There is no need for a  
confirmation from 'anothers' expereience, for understanding. For, it is  
ultimately only an acknowledgement for knowledge what one already has, thats  
all. If 'anothers' experience matches with our existing understanding, mind or  
the ego or the little 'I' nods in confirmation and at the same time, if the  
'anothers' experience does not matches with our existing understanding, mind  
or the ego or the little 'I' nods in non confirmation and this leads to  
discussions, etc... anhd the Mind - ego - little 'I' goes on discussing so  
long the so called 'another' confirms to its own existing or preconceived  
knowledge.   
The 'one' that wants knowledge is the ego, the knowledge that is being created  
in the process is also the ego's. The Mind some how wants to be acknowledged  
as a 'Jnani' or it wants to be acknowledged as a super consciousness, or it  
wants to just enjoy, relish having the title of "Self" or acknowledgement for  
having 'Self-Realised'   
So in all these, who is the one that is wanting to get 'realised'? it is the  
ego - mind - little 'I'. Its like, as a stage drama is being enacted, you act  
as 'Ravana' character and forget that you are just the actor, and as a  
character - 'Ravana' tries to realise its Self as 'Rama' \- which eventually  
becomes another character in itself. The ego - mind - little 'I' gets lost in  
the character of 'Ravana' tries so hard to realised its Self as 'Rama' instead  
of just casting away just the character of Ravana and remain as the one who  
performed the character.

Dear I,   
that means, like Krishna says in the Gita, Uddaret Atmanaatmaanam, the Self is  
its own friend and foe, one has to lift Himself from his own higher Self and  
not let itself fall from its own lower Self.   
Mis-interpretaions and mis understandings are biggest grace in themselves,  
they bestow higher grace than 'Knowledge' itself. It is only because of Mis-  
interpretaions and mis understandings that we begin to enquire further.   
More over it is only the Mind that distinguishes between Misunderstanding and  
Understanding.   
Meditation, for is just being aware of ones own ego, till it gets dissolved  
into nothingness or everything ness.   
Meditation is for me, "Chumma Iru", "Just being" Let all move around you, Just  
Be.   
Bhagavan says - "To know and not to think"

The non existent ego coming out of the non existent mind watches the Self.  
But   
in the beginning, it watches only the thoughts. In a thoughtless abandon, it  
watches   
the Self, in the sense it becomes the Self. The last stage, " watching the  
Self and   
being the Self" is through Guru's Grace. Bhagavan Ramana says in Sri  
Arunachala   
Akshara Mana Maalai: Do not show the mirror to this noseless person and makes  
him   
ashamed. Please lift me up and hug me. (AAMM 91)

Nisargadatta Maharaj said that it is very important to watch "I-am-ness" all  
the time.   
How is that possible?   
How can the subject watch the subject itself?  
Bhagavans explanation is given below -   
"First the Self sees itself as object, then the Self sees itself as Void, and  
finally it sees itiself as Self, here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
The subject is ego, ego first begins watching itself, ego watching ego, and as  
a result of such an enquiry ego ceases to exist and Self shines and when this  
(occurs) the Subject will not be there, the ego will not be there, the very  
need to know that you are the Self has to end.

Dear I,   
All interpretations and understanding are correct. There is no need for a  
confirmation from 'anothers' expereience, for understanding. For, it is  
ultimately only an acknowledgement for knowledge what one already has, thats  
all. If 'anothers' experience matches with our existing understanding, mind or  
the ego or the little 'I' nods in confirmation and at the same time, if the  
'anothers' experience does not matches with our existing understanding, mind  
or the ego or the little 'I' nods in non confirmation and this leads to  
discussions, etc... anhd the Mind - ego - little 'I' goes on discussing so  
long the so called 'another' confirms to its own existing or preconceived  
knowledge.   
The 'one' that wants knowledge is the ego, the knowledge that is being created  
in the process is also the ego's. The Mind some how wants to be acknowledged  
as a 'Jnani' or it wants to be acknowledged as a super consciousness, or it  
wants to just enjoy, relish having the title of "Self" or acknowledgement for  
having 'Self-Realised'   
So in all these, who is the one that is wanting to get 'realised'? it is the  
ego - mind - little 'I'. Its like, as a stage drama is being enacted, you act  
as 'Ravana' character and forget that you are just the actor, and as a  
character - 'Ravana' tries to realise its Self as 'Rama' \- which eventually  
becomes another character in itself. The ego - mind - little 'I' gets lost in  
the character of 'Ravana' tries so hard to realised its Self as 'Rama' instead  
of just casting away just the character of Ravana and remain as the one who  
performed the character.

Dear I,   
that means, like Krishna says in the Gita, Uddaret Atmanaatmaanam, the Self is  
its own friend and foe, one has to lift Himself from his own higher Self and  
not let itself fall from its own lower Self.   
Mis-interpretaions and mis understandings are biggest grace in themselves,  
they bestow higher grace than 'Knowledge' itself. It is only because of Mis-  
interpretaions and mis understandings that we begin to enquire further.   
More over it is only the Mind that distinguishes between Misunderstanding and  
Understanding.   
Meditation, for is just being aware of ones own ego, till it gets dissolved  
into nothingness or everything ness.   
Meditation is for me, "Chumma Iru", "Just being" Let all move around you, Just  
Be.

Nice discussion.   
Nice points raised by subramanian garu,nagaraj garu and udai garu.   
I agree with subramanian garu regarding Suddha Manas,or Sattva Manas, which  
does not produce any prarabdha effect. Bhagavan Ramana did write books, did  
have some thoughts,why only thoughts, He did have dreams too.   
I agree with udai garu regarding we cannot have control over our thoughts and  
it is not like we desire and hence we have thoughts.   
Only because we cannot have control over our thoughts several techniques like  
breath control,self enquiry.... are mentioned.   
In Bhagavad Gita Ch6 Text35 Lord Krishna says,   
The Blessed Lord said: O mighty-armed son of Kunti, **it is undoubtedly very  
difficult to curb the restless mind, but it is possible by constant practice  
and by detachment.**   
Here detachment means having strong conviction that ' i am not the  
mind,body,senses...' which reminds Adi sankara's Nirvana Satakam poem.   
Once bhagavan said   
If the outlook changes, the troubles of the world will not worry us. Are the  
waves different from the ocean? Why do the waves occur at all? If asked, what  
reply can we give? The troubles in the world also are like that. Waves come  
and go. If it is found out that they are not different from Atma this worry  
will not exist.

Dear srkudai, Nagaraj,   
The sense of "I am" is simply experiencing. For seekers, they have   
to watch the sense of "I am". Thereafter, it is only experiencing   
not describable by thoughts and words and deeds. Bhagavan   
Ramana used to quote Saint Tayumanavar and another old song   
in this context.   
Tayumanavar: It is like a newly married girl, coming out of the nuptial room in   
the early morning. What shall she say about her experience?   
She will not talk or describe to anyone. Even to her mother who   
is waiting anxiously in the morning, she would simply give a small   
smile and rush to take bath! Imagine, a celibate saint poet has   
written this! A celibate Brahma Jnani has quoted this!   
The old song: (Which Devaraja Mudaliar quotes in his book   
"You are my mother and You are my father.": It is like a drunken fellow returning home at night. He does   
not know where his dhoti is, where is towel is, where his bed   
is. He does not want anything. He does not want even food.   
He simply wants to lie in bed with the experience.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear I,   
There is really no sense of experiencing "I am". it is simply being. It  
remains experience so long the Self enquiry continues till the mind/I merges  
where the perfect Self emerges as 'I-I'   
The example quoted by Ramana Maharshi is the first (stage) in what he says: "First the Self sees itself as object, then the Self sees itself as Void, and  
finally it sees itiself as Self, here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
Therefore,   
Experiencing the sense of "I am" is "First the Self sees itself as object"   
and   
in reality, "I am" is simply being - "and finally it sees itiself as Self,  
here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
Which is why I have always stressed in my other posts that Bhagawan's answers  
to several questions were tailor made as per the Pakva of the Questioneer.  
Those answers and Dialogues recorded as books should not be taken at face  
value as his answers to our same question. We have seen several instances  
where Bhagawan has responded differently for same questions. But His grace  
shall take care of the devotee all through!   
Salutations to Sri Ramana.

Dear srkudai, Nagaraj,   
The sense of "I am" is simply experiencing. For seekers, they have   
to watch the sense of "I am". Thereafter, it is only experiencing   
not describable by thoughts and words and deeds. Bhagavan   
Ramana used to quote Saint Tayumanavar and another old song   
in this context.   
Tayumanavar: It is like a newly married girl, coming out of the nuptial room in   
the early morning. What shall she say about her experience?   
She will not talk or describe to anyone. Even to her mother who   
is waiting anxiously in the morning, she would simply give a small   
smile and rush to take bath! Imagine, a celibate saint poet has   
written this! A celibate Brahma Jnani has quoted this!   
The old song: (Which Devaraja Mudaliar quotes in his book   
"You are my mother and You are my father.": It is like a drunken fellow returning home at night. He does   
not know where his dhoti is, where is towel is, where his bed   
is. He does not want anything. He does not want even food.   
He simply wants to lie in bed with the experience.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear I,   
There is really no sense of experiencing "I am". it is simply being. It  
remains experience so long the Self enquiry continues till the mind/I merges  
where the perfect Self emerges as 'I-I'   
The example quoted by Ramana Maharshi is the first (stage) in what he says: "First the Self sees itself as object, then the Self sees itself as Void, and  
finally it sees itiself as Self, here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
Therefore,   
Experiencing the sense of "I am" is "First the Self sees itself as object"   
and   
in reality, "I am" is simply being - "and finally it sees itiself as Self,  
here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
Which is why I have always stressed in my other posts that Bhagawan's answers  
to several questions were tailor made as per the Pakva of the Questioneer.  
Those answers and Dialogues recorded as books should not be taken at face  
value as his answers to our same question. We have seen several instances  
where Bhagawan has responded differently for same questions. But His grace  
shall take care of the devotee all through!   
Salutations to Sri Ramana.

Quote from: Akira on March 15, 2010, 04:14:41 PM  
Quote from: snow on January 07, 2010, 03:06:33 PM  
Nisargadatta Maharaj said that it is very important to watch "I-am-ness" all  
the time.   
How is that possible?   
How can the subject watch the subject itself?  
Bhagavans explanation is given below -   
"First the Self sees itself as object, then the Self sees itself as Void, and  
finally it sees itiself as Self, here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
The subject is ego, ego first begins watching itself, ego watching ego, and as  
a result of such an enquiry ego ceases to exist and Self shines and when this  
(occurs) the Subject will not be there, the ego will not be there, the very  
need to know that you are the Self has to end.

Dear I,   
All interpretations and understanding are correct. There is no need for a  
confirmation from 'anothers' expereience, for understanding. For, it is  
ultimately only an acknowledgement for knowledge what one already has, thats  
all. If 'anothers' experience matches with our existing understanding, mind or  
the ego or the little 'I' nods in confirmation and at the same time, if the  
'anothers' experience does not matches with our existing understanding, mind  
or the ego or the little 'I' nods in non confirmation and this leads to  
discussions, etc... anhd the Mind - ego - little 'I' goes on discussing so  
long the so called 'another' confirms to its own existing or preconceived  
knowledge.   
The 'one' that wants knowledge is the ego, the knowledge that is being created  
in the process is also the ego's. The Mind some how wants to be acknowledged  
as a 'Jnani' or it wants to be acknowledged as a super consciousness, or it  
wants to just enjoy, relish having the title of "Self" or acknowledgement for  
having 'Self-Realised'   
So in all these, who is the one that is wanting to get 'realised'? it is the  
ego - mind - little 'I'. Its like, as a stage drama is being enacted, you act  
as 'Ravana' character and forget that you are just the actor, and as a  
character - 'Ravana' tries to realise its Self as 'Rama' \- which eventually  
becomes another character in itself. The ego - mind - little 'I' gets lost in  
the character of 'Ravana' tries so hard to realised its Self as 'Rama' instead  
of just casting away just the character of Ravana and remain as the one who  
performed the character.

Dear I,   
that means, like Krishna says in the Gita, Uddaret Atmanaatmaanam, the Self is  
its own friend and foe, one has to lift Himself from his own higher Self and  
not let itself fall from its own lower Self.   
Mis-interpretaions and mis understandings are biggest grace in themselves,  
they bestow higher grace than 'Knowledge' itself. It is only because of Mis-  
interpretaions and mis understandings that we begin to enquire further.   
More over it is only the Mind that distinguishes between Misunderstanding and  
Understanding.   
Meditation, for is just being aware of ones own ego, till it gets dissolved  
into nothingness or everything ness.   
Meditation is for me, "Chumma Iru", "Just being" Let all move around you, Just  
Be.   
Bhagavan says - "To know and not to think"

The non existent ego coming out of the non existent mind watches the Self.  
But   
in the beginning, it watches only the thoughts. In a thoughtless abandon, it  
watches   
the Self, in the sense it becomes the Self. The last stage, " watching the  
Self and   
being the Self" is through Guru's Grace. Bhagavan Ramana says in Sri  
Arunachala   
Akshara Mana Maalai: Do not show the mirror to this noseless person and makes  
him   
ashamed. Please lift me up and hug me. (AAMM 91)   
Arunachala Siva.

Nice discussion.   
Nice points raised by subramanian garu,nagaraj garu and udai garu.   
I agree with subramanian garu regarding Suddha Manas,or Sattva Manas, which  
does not produce any prarabdha effect. Bhagavan Ramana did write books, did  
have some thoughts,why only thoughts, He did have dreams too.   
I agree with udai garu regarding we cannot have control over our thoughts and  
it is not like we desire and hence we have thoughts.   
Only because we cannot have control over our thoughts several techniques like  
breath control,self enquiry.... are mentioned.   
In Bhagavad Gita Ch6 Text35 Lord Krishna says,   
The Blessed Lord said: O mighty-armed son of Kunti, **it is undoubtedly very  
difficult to curb the restless mind, but it is possible by constant practice  
and by detachment.**   
Here detachment means having strong conviction that ' i am not the  
mind,body,senses...' which reminds Adi sankara's Nirvana Satakam poem.   
Once bhagavan said   
If the outlook changes, the troubles of the world will not worry us. Are the  
waves different from the ocean? Why do the waves occur at all? If asked, what  
reply can we give? The troubles in the world also are like that. Waves come  
and go. If it is found out that they are not different from Atma this worry

Nisargadatta Maharaj said that it is very important to watch "I-am-ness" all  
the time.   
How is that possible?   
How can the subject watch the subject itself?  
Bhagavans explanation is given below -   
"First the Self sees itself as object, then the Self sees itself as Void, and  
finally it sees itiself as Self, here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
The subject is ego, ego first begins watching itself, ego watching ego, and as  
a result of such an enquiry ego ceases to exist and Self shines and when this  
(occurs) the Subject will not be there, the ego will not be there, the very  
need to know that you are the Self has to end.

Dear I,   
All interpretations and understanding are correct. There is no need for a  
confirmation from 'anothers' expereience, for understanding. For, it is  
ultimately only an acknowledgement for knowledge what one already has, thats  
all. If 'anothers' experience matches with our existing understanding, mind or  
the ego or the little 'I' nods in confirmation and at the same time, if the  
'anothers' experience does not matches with our existing understanding, mind  
or the ego or the little 'I' nods in non confirmation and this leads to  
discussions, etc... anhd the Mind - ego - little 'I' goes on discussing so  
long the so called 'another' confirms to its own existing or preconceived  
knowledge.   
The 'one' that wants knowledge is the ego, the knowledge that is being created  
in the process is also the ego's. The Mind some how wants to be acknowledged  
as a 'Jnani' or it wants to be acknowledged as a super consciousness, or it  
wants to just enjoy, relish having the title of "Self" or acknowledgement for  
having 'Self-Realised'   
So in all these, who is the one that is wanting to get 'realised'? it is the  
ego - mind - little 'I'. Its like, as a stage drama is being enacted, you act  
as 'Ravana' character and forget that you are just the actor, and as a  
character - 'Ravana' tries to realise its Self as 'Rama' \- which eventually  
becomes another character in itself. The ego - mind - little 'I' gets lost in  
the character of 'Ravana' tries so hard to realised its Self as 'Rama' instead  
of just casting away just the character of Ravana and remain as the one who  
performed the character.

Dear I,   
that means, like Krishna says in the Gita, Uddaret Atmanaatmaanam, the Self is  
its own friend and foe, one has to lift Himself from his own higher Self and  
not let itself fall from its own lower Self.   
Mis-interpretaions and mis understandings are biggest grace in themselves,  
they bestow higher grace than 'Knowledge' itself. It is only because of Mis-  
interpretaions and mis understandings that we begin to enquire further.   
More over it is only the Mind that distinguishes between Misunderstanding and  
Understanding.   
Meditation, for is just being aware of ones own ego, till it gets dissolved  
into nothingness or everything ness.   
Meditation is for me, "Chumma Iru", "Just being" Let all move around you, Just  
Be.

Nice discussion.   
Nice points raised by subramanian garu,nagaraj garu and udai garu.   
I agree with subramanian garu regarding Suddha Manas,or Sattva Manas, which  
does not produce any prarabdha effect. Bhagavan Ramana did write books, did  
have some thoughts,why only thoughts, He did have dreams too.   
I agree with udai garu regarding we cannot have control over our thoughts and  
it is not like we desire and hence we have thoughts.   
Only because we cannot have control over our thoughts several techniques like  
breath control,self enquiry.... are mentioned.   
In Bhagavad Gita Ch6 Text35 Lord Krishna says,   
The Blessed Lord said: O mighty-armed son of Kunti, **it is undoubtedly very  
difficult to curb the restless mind, but it is possible by constant practice  
and by detachment.**   
Here detachment means having strong conviction that ' i am not the  
mind,body,senses...' which reminds Adi sankara's Nirvana Satakam poem.   
Once bhagavan said   
If the outlook changes, the troubles of the world will not worry us. Are the  
waves different from the ocean? Why do the waves occur at all? If asked, what  
reply can we give? The troubles in the world also are like that. Waves come

Dear srkudai, Nagaraj,   
The sense of "I am" is simply experiencing. For seekers, they have   
to watch the sense of "I am". Thereafter, it is only experiencing   
not describable by thoughts and words and deeds. Bhagavan   
Ramana used to quote Saint Tayumanavar and another old song   
in this context.   
Tayumanavar: It is like a newly married girl, coming out of the nuptial room in   
the early morning. What shall she say about her experience?   
She will not talk or describe to anyone. Even to her mother who   
is waiting anxiously in the morning, she would simply give a small   
smile and rush to take bath! Imagine, a celibate saint poet has   
written this! A celibate Brahma Jnani has quoted this!   
The old song: (Which Devaraja Mudaliar quotes in his book   
"You are my mother and You are my father.": It is like a drunken fellow returning home at night. He does   
not know where his dhoti is, where is towel is, where his bed   
is. He does not want anything. He does not want even food.   
He simply wants to lie in bed with the experience.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear I,   
There is really no sense of experiencing "I am". it is simply being. It  
remains experience so long the Self enquiry continues till the mind/I merges  
where the perfect Self emerges as 'I-I'   
The example quoted by Ramana Maharshi is the first (stage) in what he says: "First the Self sees itself as object, then the Self sees itself as Void, and  
finally it sees itiself as Self, here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
Therefore,   
Experiencing the sense of "I am" is "First the Self sees itself as object"   
and   
in reality, "I am" is simply being - "and finally it sees itiself as Self,  
here there is no seeing as seeing is being"   
Which is why I have always stressed in my other posts that Bhagawan's answers  
to several questions were tailor made as per the Pakva of the Questioneer.  
Those answers and Dialogues recorded as books should not be taken at face  
value as his answers to our same question. We have seen several instances  
where Bhagawan has responded differently for same questions. But His grace  
shall take care of the devotee all through!   
Salutations to Sri Ramana.

Dear prasanth,   
In this connection, Brahmasri Nochur Venkataraman brings a new   
dimension. He says that there is thinking and there is also 'thoughting'.  
Thinking is deliberate indulgence in a thought or an   
emotion. For example, tomorrow my son is coming. Should I keep   
the alarm-ring since he arrives by very early morning flight and be   
at home around 3.30 AM. This is thinking, and there is a chain   
of thoughts.   
Now what is this 'thoughting'? Thoughts just come and go without   
any effort on my part. Suddenly on a rainy evening in Bangalore,   
I think of my sister falling while alighting from the bus in Chennai,   
since the road was wet and slippery due to rain. Suddenly I think   
of modakams that my mother would prepare for Sri Ganesa   
Chaturthi. I think of my old house in Tiruchy with rickety doors   
and windowless rooms, where one had to put on the light even during day time.  
There are so many examples. Nochur Venkataraman says that these thoughtings  
are also coming out of vasanas but they are harmless, and there is no ego  
involved there.   
Arunachala Siva.

## How to watch the sense 'I am'  
Author: snow                Date: January 07, 2010, 03:06:33 PM

Nisargadatta Maharaj said that it is very important to watch "I-am-ness" all  
the time. I don't however understand what this sense "I Am" contains. Does it  
include seeing, smelling, hearing etc.? Should I be mindful of these also? Or  
is it enough if I just do like Maharshi said: "Get rid of your present  
thoughts, that is all."   
This however seems a little difficult (atleast when I'm not meditating). But  
would you say that just letting go of thinking is basically all that is  
necessary.

Dear Snow,   
Good question.   
It is the natural feeling of the sense of "I am" which Nisargadatta Maharaj is  
pointing to.   
This feeling is there even if we shut out our senses. For example: We can close our eyes and shut out the sense of vision. "I am" is still there.   
We can close our ears with our fingers and shut out the sense of hearing. "I  
am" is still there.   
We can close our mouth and shut out the sense of taste. "I am" is still there.   
So what is this "I am" which seems to be independent of senses etc.   
How far can we go towards its source?   
Bhagavan Ramana says to find out, "from where this 'I' arises".   
In the process attention will go towards the pure consciousness within.   
Nisargadatta Maharaj says to remain with the sense of "I am" at its root (as  
far as possible) without allowing thoughts to extend "I am" as "I am this or  
that" (like "I am Henry", "I am a teacher", "I am feeling hot" etc.). The  
effect of this is also to take one towards the pure consciousness within.

The state of I AM is simply I AM.   
It is defintely not I am this or I am that.   
I AM is the state of Existence/Witness.   
Dear snow, it is ver difficult to remain in that I AM. That is why   
Bhagavan Ramana said: Ask for whom this thought? It is for me.   
Who am I? Keep on killing the soldiers coming out of the enemy   
fortress. It is difficult, so Bhagavan said Atma Vidya is very easy.   
It is because, we are carrying huge dirt of thoughts and vasanas,   
from many previous births. Guru's Grace alone will remove it one   
stroke, like the Sun removes the darkness of a room, closed and kept in  
darkness for years.

Is this one necessary to say? Isn't it pretty obivious? I find this not to be  
as powerful question to the mind than "Who am I" which is (like Adyashanti  
said) an alarm clock thrown in the dream.   
And can Bhagavan be my guru even though he left his body decades ago?

Dear snow,   
"I find this one as not powerful question..." \- I am not clear   
as to what this question, which is not powerful, that you refer.   
Kindly let me know.   
Should Bhagavan Ramana be only living in a body, to be our Guru?   
He remained in body for some years. One cannot live for ever in   
body. Further, why do you associate a body, for selecting a guru?   
Only those who are body conscious should worry about the guru being   
in body. Is not His Presence, powerful enough, to be your Guru?   
His Presence is all pervading but the power is felt at its highest   
in His Samadhi as well as in Old Hall, where He sat for 23 years   
and guided devotees. If you visit T'malai next time, kindly sit   
in the Samadhi Hall or Old Hall, for about an hour. You shall   
definitely feel the Power of Presence, engulfing you.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear snow,   
Yes. Letting go of all thoughts about the objective world - is   
the thoughtless state, that is essential for self enquiry. Thought   
about God within, Bhagavan Ramana says, Atma Nishtaparan, in   
Who am I? is the greatest devotion. Hence this thought should   
be retained till it matures into surrender. Once the total surrender   
becomes your nature, there is no need even for thought of God, since   
there is only God within you and not any more of you.   
The question, for whom this thought arises? is necessary and must   
be continued, till worldly thoughts keep bothering you. At one stage, for  
whom this thought arises? - will not arise at all. That   
is abidance in Self. If this abidance in Self becomes permanent,   
then it is Sahaja Stithi. Thereafter every worldly activity of yours   
will be done by That, as Ribhu Gita, Ch.26 Verse 25 states.   
Arunachala Siva.

What is the feeling of existing ? Seek within. What is the feeling on  
existing ? Now.   
Sometimes I call myself to find myself : Q : hello ? A : hmm ? Q: hello ?  
A:ar hmmm ? Q:hello ? A:... I am here ?   
But I am is coloured by the impressions/conditioning picked up. Holding the I  
am, deeper and deeper into the I am you go, beyond the impressions until there  
is just I am, and then one step further. .. which cannot be described.

the sense of "Iam" is effortless, so making effort to reach it is

Dear I,   
It takes a mammoth effort to do something, to think and it takes absolutely no  
effort at all to simply be. This is the greatest irony that 'mind' thinks  
other wise and never rests! This is the essence of 'I am'   
Just cast of the very need to understand this and simply be. do not attempt to  
know or even bother to answer your question, cast of your very question  
itself, relax and just be. You do not need to know anything about "I am" that  
is really being 'I am'   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
This. .. "Cast off everything and just be". .. when you say it, someone takes  
it into the mind. And then, its a memory.   
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
how to cast off everything and just be ?   
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
You tell me... you told this. .. just be. .. but do u really remain like that?  
The point is simple. .. anger just comes in a moment's time! IT wont give you  
time enough to refer to your memory and find "who am i sentence" and do it!   
Love!

Dear I,   
The moment you responded, you are not just being. You - 'I' \- Thoughts just  
don't want to be. see it wants to continue.   
Quote  
But moments of anger, jealousy, lust, fear, worry, guilt. .. they come  
automatically. .. very fast. So fast that the person does not get time to  
remember your statement until some time!   
they don't come automatically, it comes because there is a need for all these  
emotions. To put it more clearly, these emotions arise because when any  
thought which arises and questions the very foundation of you - 'I' \- your  
thoughts, then it responds frantically, anger, fear, etc.. comes because it  
itself is under threat, its place is under question. hence these emotions  
arise.   
And at the same time, if any emotions such as comforting or happiness arises,  
it is nothing but anything that is conforming to what it already knows, it  
feels stronger, its place is assured, hence such emotions.   
emotions such as lust arise because of its inherent need of security to exist  
permanently. Lust need not necessarily be physical, money, material etc.. are  
all accumulated because of insecurity or incmpleteness.   
Quote  
If the person is already JUST IS, this is redundant to say.   
if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement does not help him. .. coz  
his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no choice.   
If the person is already as you say Just Is, then he would not have posted it  
here. and as you say "if the person is not already JUST IS, this statement  
does not help him. .. coz his mind wont allow him to just be! he has no  
choice." is because, thoughts have to die, Manonasham is this. Thoughts - you  
- 'I' need thoughts to survive.   
The very moment you read this post you have already put effort. Just Be is  
zero effort. zero thinking, where you can't see that you are not thinking for  
if you begin to see that you are not thinking, you have put an effort there.  
Just Be.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear prasanth,   
In this connection, Brahmasri Nochur Venkataraman brings a new   
dimension. He says that there is thinking and there is also 'thoughting'.  
Thinking is deliberate indulgence in a thought or an   
emotion. For example, tomorrow my son is coming. Should I keep   
the alarm-ring since he arrives by very early morning flight and be   
at home around 3.30 AM. This is thinking, and there is a chain   
of thoughts.   
Now what is this 'thoughting'? Thoughts just come and go without   
any effort on my part. Suddenly on a rainy evening in Bangalore,   
I think of my sister falling while alighting from the bus in Chennai,   
since the road was wet and slippery due to rain. Suddenly I think   
of modakams that my mother would prepare for Sri Ganesa   
Chaturthi. I think of my old house in Tiruchy with rickety doors   
and windowless rooms, where one had to put on the light even during day time.  
There are so many examples. Nochur Venkataraman says that these thoughtings  
are also coming out of vasanas but they are harmless, and there is no ego  
involved there.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Is eating and drinking also part of effort and one requires to refrain from  
them to "Just Be"?   
What do you say?   
I am trying to understand whether it can be classified as a thoughtful or  
thoughtless activity.

I am trying to understand whether it can be classified as a thoughtful or  
thoughtless activity.  
Why do you - 'I' want to know, whether eating and drinking also is part of  
effort and whether one has to refrain from them to "Just Be" \- please see,  
this very need is taking you - 'I' away from Just Being. This is what you -  
'I' \- Mind - Thought is doing. Questioning!   
Just for purposes of clarity, in a thoughtless (state) what matters to you -  
'I' ? why speculate about it now Thinking about it? what ever you think about  
it now, is going to be false as it falls in the realms of thoughts only!   
A honest answer thought can give is - "you - thought - 'I' will know answer  
for your question only in thought-less (state) {in reality you will never know  
for you - thoughts will never be there to know this answer}   
Ideally, Ramana Mahashi would say, first get to the thoughtless (state) and  
then ask this question.   
You - 'I' (as in - Thoughts) can never know Manonasham (state) what ever you  
know is just thought alone! Please see, it is you - 'I' \- Mind - thought that  
is just hungry for thinking - Thoughts, Mind just want to procreate for  
continuity for eternity.   
Please see, as I mentioned in other posts about the Sushupti (State), is there  
any hunger, thirst, life, Body, others, world, are you there? where are these  
questions about the effort and effortlessness, activity and inactivity!

How to watch the sense 'I am'  
Dear Snow,   
Sence of "I am" is what watches so called "you" all the time. Try to get rid  
of it and you will not succeed. When you are defeated in such a way, you'll  
see how to watch it.

dear rideforever you said   
" Please help me understand. You say do not try. .. so you mean do nothing ?  
Or are you saying do something subtle ?"**   
try as you like, it is ok to meditate, to make effort..but know that all  
effort is contraproductive as a mental concentration activity..   
what we look for is eternal, everpresent concioussness...and it is simply the  
arising of htis moment..not a big thing..just this   
now tell me Who creates thsi moment...if you found a personality who makes  
this moment   
then tell me next who sustains this moment?   
if you can find someone then show me a person who transcends this moment...   
oyu will never find anything apart from this moment...no sustainer no creator  
no destroyer   
it simply is...and no one is there to make this...yo effor tis senseless...but  
still we need to make effort daily   
its a paradox but a very gentle and loving paradox..so make effort, hard  
effort and then more and more subtle but know deeply understand deeply that it  
is for nothing because there is no one to achive enlightment, enlightment is  
allready (primordially) the nature of htis moment...it is self arising,  
spontanious samadhi   
you cannot reach it, you cannot miss it, you can not grasp it hold it or  
whatever...so best thing is to relax...

If you are looking or if you are relaxing, you are doing something.   
"Is there any meaning in wanting to be a jnani ?", or does enlightenment just  
happen ?   
"Is it possible to make an effort to be a jnani ?"   
"Why did Sri Ramana write a book about jnana ? reading a book is gaining a  
vasana"   
Yes, I think, wanting to be a jnana might have some value. I am not saying  
definitely, I am saying there is a possibility that it would help to want to  
be a jnana.   
The instruction "hold onto the I-feeling". This is a vasana. Can it help you  
? Perhaps.   
Perhaps if you have a small amount of wanting, a small amount of doing, it can  
take you 95% on the path, and then you give that up and you are pulled from  
the other side 5%.   
If you think that any effort is against jnana, then stop being a jnana. Stop  
relaxing. Stop looking. Forget it.

Bhagavan Ramana has said the following on the various points   
mentioned: 1. Desiring the Self is the only desire that one can have. If   
desire is meant as vasana, this is the only vasana that one can   
have.   
2. Bhagavan Ramana did write books, did have some thoughts,   
why only thoughts, He did have dreams too. He did drinking   
and sleeping. He has said that this is done by the Pure Mind   
or Suddha Manas, or Sattva Manas, which does not produce   
any prarabdha effect. It is from the Pure Mind, which is like   
the burnt rope. The burnt rope has only a form but of little   
use for any activity i.e. activity that we normally mean.   
He has also said that the Self does everything that a self realized   
jnani does. It is an advaitic paradox. Sri Sankara did all the work,   
including pilgrimages (which Bhagavan Ramana did not do) with   
this Pure Mind or the Self. It is said in Tamil - Ninaiyamal ninainthu...  
thinking without thinking, sollaamal solli. .. telling   
without telling.... kaanaamal kandu....seeing without seeing.   
It is like doing acitivity in a dream. He has said this to Maurice   
Frydman in one of His conversations.

This article which seems written by Maurice Frydman is actually yours, it has  
become yours when you have read it. Its again your thought. Like this all the  
various books written by various devotees are verily their own (your)  
thoughts.   
Is it not just a thought again? that Bhagawan had thoughts, dreams, ate, drank  
etc...? whose thoughts are these? Who is the 'I' to whom these thoughts arise?  
please see.   
They are all just thoughts.
