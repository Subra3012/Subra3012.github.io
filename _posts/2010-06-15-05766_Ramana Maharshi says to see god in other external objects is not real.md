All like child but do they like childish when we grow?   
But when jnani's case it is accepted. Reason.....

Dear ramanaduli garu,   
Bhagavan Ramana used to say: Every person should be like a child.Then one can  
get Brahmananda.   
Annamalai Swami asked: "Then what is the difference between a child and a  
Jnani?   
Bhagavan Ramana replied: A child does not know anything because of its pure ignorance.   
A Jnani does know everything because of his pure wisdom.   
 **Source** : Sri Ramana Ninaivugal - Tamil - Annamalai Swami.   
 _Once Dr Raju garu in this forum said_   
A child is childish and innocent with his tendencies lying inside in a dormant  
stage and spending up of tendencies not yet started,so his innocence may be  
contaminated at any time.   
 **Jnani is not chidish but have "child like" innocence but his innocence  
cannot be contaminated because his tendencies are destroyed once and  
forever.**

Dear prasanth_ramana_maharshi & Subramanian.R   
You gave two characteristics of Mithya: 1\. An appearance or fantasy   
2\. Dependence on other things like pot and mud   
Further Analysis: An appearance or fantasy or impossibility (like hare with horns) can be  
considered to exist for a finite time within the mind as imagination. They do  
not consume space but consume time.   
Pot is made up of mud. If matter and mind are mithya, what are they made up  
of?   
Dear srkudai,   
You gave the following characteristic of Mithya: \- What is in the mind is Mithya. Mind means perception.   
Further Analysis: Does perception include only the perception through the five senses? Where is  
its boundary?   
When a meditator loses body consciousness in meditation, is he/she still  
perceiving?

The body is also in mind.   
So whatever is in mind is mithya.   
so if body consciousness is lost, but the person is seeing lights or what ever  
... that is mithya too.   
Its like the famous rope and snake example. the snake is seen on a rope. The  
Rope is SAT. the snake is mithya. One can see snake on a rope, but one cannot  
see a Dog on it! That is ASAT. Mithya is ASAT too. A Dog on the rope is as  
real as a snake on the rope. But while someone sees a snake and thinks it is a  
snake... no one would imagine a Dog on it -- so the ignorant person thinks  
"snake on rope is real", but "dog on rope is unreal". But the Englightened  
person says "The snake on the rope is as unreal as the Dog on it!"   
The unenglightened finds this difficult to grasp. But that is how it is.   
Space and time are just two names for the same. .. they are just two different  
dimentions. both are made of mind.   
mind itself is mithya [mana eva hi mithya].   
that means mind is non-existent.   
so when it is non-existent, what is it made up of ? Thats meaningless. Coz  
its non existent.   
I'll put it another way. the dream i had yesterday. .. i can safely say its  
mithya. coz it appeared real for some time, but now i see it is not real. This  
world is not much different from that.   
Love!

The possibility that a rope can be mistaken for a snake shows that a  
"phenomenon" exists which can give rise to this error. There is a difference  
between nothing happens and something happens whether that something be  
illusion, delusion or whatever. Each individual magic of a magician can be an  
illusion, but that a magic show is going on cannot be said to be non-existent.   
If yesterday we had a dream, we cannot say that the dream was non-existent.  
The dream took place and it ended. Only the dream world which I saw yesterday  
is non-existent today. If the dream itself was non-existent, we will say  
"yesterday I did not have a dream".   
Suppose we have a dream that there is a bag of gold under a tree. We go there  
and find that there is none. We never repeat going there anymore. But even  
after a person becomes jnani, he continues to engage in the world. If hunger,  
thirst etc are non-existent (mithya), why does the jnani continue to have food  
and drinks?

The possibility that the rope is mistaken for a snake exists because of  
existence of knowledge of snake and ideas about it. Even the ideas about  
happenning or not happening is all because of some already existing knowledge  
of events and similarly about the illusions of a magician.   
Existence of Mithya basically is because of some already preconceived  
knowledge about the subject matters.   
There for who is the one that has been possessing all these knowledges? That  
is the repository of all knowledges sum of all total past lives of ours. Who  
is that 'I' then?   
That 'I' is itself found to be Mithya!   
Mithya exists only for Mithya !!!!!!

Arunachala, is verily our own Self. It is reflection of our True Self.   
The very first Shloka in Aksharamana Malai goes thus:  _Arunachalamena Ahameninaippavar Ahattaiveraruppay Arunachala._   
1\. Thou dost root out the ego of those who meditate on Thee in the heart, O  
Arunachala!   
2\. Thou dost root out the ego of those who dwell on their (spiritual)  
identity with Thee, O Arunachala!   
Eventually even rope has to go. The Rope which is mistaken for a snake is  
verily our selves - our false self.   
Even that a Rope is existing is also a knowledge.   
That I real Self is beyond any description, attributeless. There is absolutely  
no second to it, to even compare. For even for knowledge, we need a second to  
make it as a knowledge.   
It itself is.

Arunachala, is our true Self. Sri Bhagavan has said that our Self is our True  
Guru. Arunachala, as our Self is a grace of our True Self, which keeps  
reminding us about our true nature. It is reminding us to descard the robes of  
all the character we are playing and just remain as Self. When we really  
descard all roles we are playing, what role do we have to play? That is when  
we will be truly naked. Spatika!

Dear silentgreen garu,   
Quote  
If hunger, thirst etc are non-existent (mithya), why does the jnani continue  
to have food and drinks?  
We should not mix up dream state and waking state.   
As bhagavan says,Ideally waking and dream states are same and just as in dream  
state where we try to fill our hunger with dream food in waking state he try  
to fill our hunger with waking food.But as known both waking and dream are not  
our real nature.   
Quote  
If yesterday we had a dream, we cannot say that the dream was non-existent.  
The dream took place and it ended. Only the dream world which I saw yesterday  
is non-existent today. If the dream itself was non-existent, we will say  
"yesterday I did not have a dream".  
We can surely say that dream was non-existent because all dreams are happening  
only in mind which itself is temporary as it stays with us in dream/waking  
states and disappears in deep sleep.   
Quote  
Pot is made up of mud. If matter and mind are mithya, what are they made up  
of?  
 **Matter is neither true nor false.matter if known that it is brahman only is  
true but if seen outside brahman is false.**   
 _Sri Adi Sankara Says   
a) world is false   
b) brahman is real   
c) world is brahman_   
As i told earlier Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami garu says,   
Scriptures tells us to enquire the relationship between god and world but it  
does not tell that god created the world and etc etc... it is like  
relationship between pot and mud. mud is god and pot is world. **So pot is  
neither true not false but it is dependent on mud. because pot can break any  
moment and finally only mud is remaining.**   
Ideally there is no relation between pot and mud as pot is nothing but mud and  
there are no 2 entities to have relationship.Similarly between god and world.

When the false 'I' is reminded that it is NOT, there arises a tremendous fear  
of oblivion, of non existence. The false 'I' does not want to let go its  
identity - the characters it has been playing. It cannot imagine itself  
without any attribute. This fear keeps the false 'I' going.   
This is the real fear of Death, the scriptures talk about, not the clinical  
death. The death of 'I'.   
When Bhagavan faced the death experience, he was down with some fever and he  
faced it upfront and realised the true Self. There was no more necessity for  
Him to play any more roles, the false 'I' just dropped of like a dry leaf in a  
tree.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

all these only exists on the seer's mind and never for a Jnani. The Jnani only  
sees Self in everything (infact, there is no everything at all) The Jnani sees  
only Self and Self alone. This _" Everything"_ exist only in the Seer's mind   
For a Jnani, the Seer and Seen are just One as **Self**   
So long there is a Seer, so long there would be a Seen.

Dear SilentGreen garu,   
There is an elephant in the forest.The elephant is scared about the Lion in  
the forest.The Lion has not appeared before the elephant in recent times. It  
was once sighted and the elephant became totally afraid of lion. One night,  
the elephant dreamt of the Lion, it got scared even its dream about the Lion.  
It woke up with a huge cry.There was not Lion. Only it was there. **The  
elephant got self realized.**   
All are dreams. But unlike the elephant's dream, our dream about Bhagavan  
Ramana is a pleasant dream. But this dream should also end one day, when you  
would really wake up.That waking is the realization.   
...After an I rises, everything rises -- Ulladu Narpadu verse 23   
 **Bhagavan Ramana used to tell one story:**   
Once two persons were sleeping in a hall.Both were poor.During the sleep, one  
man was dreaming.He dreamt that he is a very rich person and he has stacked  
all the gold and currency in a cupboard.And a thief comes and takes away all  
the gold and currency, and runs away.The dreaming man shouts in shock: "O! the  
thief is running away with all my wealth.   
Please catch him, please catch him...."   
The other man woke up. He was not dreaming anything, neither the thief, nor  
the gold and currency. What shall he do? Will he run out to the front yard to  
catch the thief? Will he rush to the police station to complain? He will  
simply wake that wailing man from sleep and dream.   
 **The Guru is like the man who wakes us, the dreaming men, up.The only  
difference is that the Guru is within your Heart.**   
 **The state where "I-thought" is not there, even in a trice,is Swarupam. This  
is called as Silence. I am Swarupam.The world is Swarupam. Isvara is Swarupam.  
All are Siva-Swarupam."**   
 **When we are not with Self, then we are with dreams. so, to contact us, It  
is something like Ramana comes to our dream by taking a form of a human body  
and says to us please come out of dreams...**

Silent Green Garu,   
Now this is really a very good question.   
Few indicators of a self-realised persons according to me   
a) They donot find happiness in external objects   
b) they live a very simple life and maintain austerity and simplicity.   
c) no attachment towards wealth etc   
d) for them god/self is only business they are living in this world and  
nothing else bother's them.   
e) they live their life by begging alms if needed also.   
f) they renounce "women and gold"   
..... list can go on and on   
Now it depends on our prarabdha karma to find out self-realised jnanis in this  
world.   
If our prarabdha is good (ofcourse it is good for all members in our forum)  
then we find real self-realised jnani like guru ramana   
If our prarabdha is sick then we may settle in some fake swamiji's (Ex: sex  
scam hit swami nityananda) feet and ruin our spiritual journey which can  
demoralise us to great extent.   
Now if you show me a guru and ask me whether he is really self-realised or not  
then my answer is I DONOT KNOW.   
Because he may tell you something but he may actually may not implement the  
same or he may secretly enjoy 'women and gold'   
Maybe other members also can give their opinions so that we can have more  
clear picture regarding this.

Honestly, the very need to know or find out if one is realised has to end.   
Firstly, why do we need such indicators? After all who are we to determine or  
say ok, Such and such a person has such qualities, He is a Liberated soul....  
Why. ..   
What are we going to gain by knowing whether a person is realised or not?   
If he is a realised person, how does it affect us or if he is not realiased  
person how does it affect us?   
There is no need to know if one person is realised at all...   
Even for that matter, To me it does not even matter to me whether Sri Ramana  
Maharshi is realised or not. It is only the pull of love or compassion that is  
worth looking into.   
This entire business of Realisation, etc.. is all only the play of our limited  
'I' In the name of realising itself (false 'I') it is just continuing.   
Sharanagathi is the only way for this limited I.   
The only thing the limited 'I' could do is to just realise its limitedness.  
That is all.

In a dream state you are likely to have dream realisation only...mithya.   
A person goes to dream and after waking up says that he met a sage, did  
penance and became self-realised. His wife congratulates him and prints a  
certificate for the dream realisation. The wife encourages him to get some  
more certificates in future. That way her husband's ascetic tendencies will be  
satisfied and he will not leave her. The person said that with proper  
orientation of the mind he will try to get some more realisations in future  
dreams.   
If this present world is exactly like the dream world, many of us are likely  
to get dream certificates, may be more than one.

Really, subconsciously, most of the spiritual aspirants, even though they may  
not even be associated with "these" organisations which give enlightenment  
certificates, they still get caught in Self Realisation, trying to become  
"Something" which is endless.   
Its simply wisdom. It is our nature. Instead we try, try and keep trying....   
Sharanagati, thats the best way, Giving up. Just be.   
All else will happen. So what for us, the real Self. why to analyse them,  
everything is perfect and happening perfectly.   
quiescence of mind is our nature. Where nothing raises up. whenever 'I' raises  
up, just get it back in to Self.   
The Self being tutor, watchman, police to Self itself. Let not the 'I' escape  
out. Let it be in the divine prison and let it get merged with Self.

Bhagavan Ramana said: 1\. The Real is only Atma Swarupam. The world, jiva and Iswara   
(personal god) are all imaginations. All the three appear and   
disappear simultaneously. Answer to the Question 16 of M.S. Pillai.   
(First Part)   
Bhagavan Ramana then proceeds to write the second part: 2\. Where there is no I-thought even for a trice, is Swarupam.   
That is also called Maunam. Swarupam is the world, Swarupam   
is I. Swarupam is Iswara. All are Siva Swarupam.   
So, Arunachala is only a Hill, when one has got I thought. When   
there is no I thought, where there is total silence, it is Swarupam.   
So Aruna Hill appears both ways to a person and a Brahma Jnani.   
The same will apply to pot and mud and snake and rope too.   
When a person looks at the pot, it is pot. When a person looks   
at the rope, firs it is snake only. When the 'true knowledge' is   
attained, they are mud and rope respectively.   
Arunachala Siva.

Let us end this discussion with the following saying of Sri Ramakrishna: It is the unwavering conviction of the jnani that Brahman alone is real and  
the world illusory. All these names and forms are illusory, like a dream. What  
Brahman is cannot be described. One cannot even say that Brahman is a Person.  
This is the opinion of the jnanis, the followers of Vedanta philosophy. But  
the bhaktas accept all the sates of consciousness. They take the waking state  
to be real also. They don't think the world to be illusory, like a dream. They  
say that the universe is a manifestation of God's power and glory. God has  
created all these -- sky, stars, moon, sun, mountains, ocean, men, and  
animals. They constitute His glory. He is within us, in our hearts. Again, He  
is outside. The most advanced devotees say that He Himself has become all this  
-- the twenty-four cosmic principles, the universe, and all living beings. The  
devotee of God wants to eat the sugar, and not to become the sugar.

The devotee of God wants to eat the sugar, and not to become the sugar.  
This is one difference between ramakrishna and ramana maharshi.   
Quote  
In day-by-day bhagavan tells   
 **They hold that they must exist and God must exist, but how is that  
possible? It seems that they must all remain for ever doing service in  
Vaikunta, but how many of them are to do service and where would there be room  
for all these Vaishnavites? "**   
Bhagavan said this laughing, and then, after a pause, he added, "On the other  
hand, Advaita does not mean that a man must always sit in samadhi and never  
engage in action. Many things are necessary to keep up the life of the body,  
and action can never be avoided. Nor is bhakti ruled out in Advaita.   
Shankara is rightly regarded as the foremost exponent of Advaita, and yet look  
at the number of shrines he visited (action), and the devotional songs he  
wrote."  
Anyhow as i said earlier there are N number of school of thoughts in Indian  
Philosphy where each school tells that their philosphy is best and perfect.   
It depends on our nature to choose one school and follow their teachings.   
Few famous schools In Indian Philosphy   
a) advaita (adi sankara,ramana maharshi,sri sundara chaitanya swami...)   
b) dvaita ( iscon and in general vaishnavaites)   
c) Vishishtadvaita ( Ramanuja)   
d) Dvaitadvaita ( Nimbarka)   
e) Buddhist philosophy   
f) Raja Yoga ( Yoga Sutras of Patanjali)   
g) Samkhya ( Sage Kapila)   
h) Cārvāka ( Madhavacharya) (Carvaka believed there was no afterlife, no life  
after death)   
.... still there are totally atleast > 25 schools

Ramakrishna was simply telling what vaishnavites say. he was like a child, he  
would just believe anyone -- if they are devotees of God.   
If you see Ramakrishna's life. .. I cannot imagine someone who is a greater  
devotee than Ramakrishna. .. and Ramakrishna would everytime merge in total  
samadhi!   
ofcourse he would say "I want to eat sugar and not be sugar"   
but every now and then, at the first sip of God's Love, he would be lost in  
nirvikalpa samadhi.   
Even the gopis used to sometimes say "I am Krishna" !   
When one goes very close to God, one cannot stop oneself from merging in God!  
Its impossible!   
The little ego some devotees maintain. .. is just prarabdha. .. its like a  
burnt rope, Ramakrishna used to say.   
Ramakrishna is an example of perfect surrender. .. he would go to a zoo and  
the moment he sees a tiger, he would drift into total samadhi... and perhaps  
fall down !   
Ramakrishna's love for God is a true example. One just needs to read his  
gospel to understand the True meaning of Love of God. I feel its no less than  
Bhagavatam! So divine. From first page to last page is just love of God!   
At the same time, Ramana was also a great devotee. He showed Sharanagatha  
bhakti. Very rarely we would find him going into madhura aspect. .. in  
Aksharamanimalai where he touches upon madhura Bhakti. .. even there he is  
mostly singing in absolute Sharanagathi.   
Love!   
Silence

The life of Sri Ramakrishna is a combination of jnana and ecstatic devotion.   
Sri Ramakrishna is perhaps the only saint who has worshipped so many Gods and  
Goddesses together with such a great intensity of devotion and at the same  
time pursued advaita sadhana. The knowledge of advaita did not reduce the  
ecstatic bhakti of Sri Ramakrishna. As he was a child of the Divine Mother, so  
he remained as her child only. Sri Ramakrishna's devotion for Sri Krishna  
reached the height of Mahabhava, the highest devotional stage of Bhakti  
mentioned in the Vaishnava literature. It is said that Sri Radha, Sri  
Chaitanya and Sri Ramakrishna are the only three who has reached the  
Mahabhava. Listening to scriptures of Shiva used to take Sri Ramakrishna to  
such deep samadhi as if he will never come back. So he often told the devotee  
to chant stotras of Devi to bring the mind down.   
In a single life Sri Ramakrishna had the vision of Divine Mother, Sri Krishna,  
Lord Shiva, Sri Radha, Sri Chaitanya and Nithyananda, Sri Rama, Jesus Christ,  
Buddha and many more. And combine it with Advaita. Sri Ramakrishna is a  
combination of the essence of all major religions and sects.   
To understand Sri Ramakrishna one has to have a devotion as transparent as  
pure water which is at the same time fathomless, on which any Gods and  
Goddesses can be imprinted. It is equally amenable to bhakti and jnana.  
Bhagavan Ramana used to walk all by himself till the end, but Sri Ramakrishna  
always had an attendent; for his moods were varied, "Bhava Sagara", and  
anytime his mind used to surge to samadhi losing all sense of external world.  
He once fell down during samadhi and injured his arm.   
Many have slighted the visions of Sri Ramakrishna, including Narendranath  
himself in the beginning. Who can fathom such mysteries? Sri Ramakrishna  
continued to have visions even after Advaita realisation. And many of his  
visions used to come true. He was Brahman Himself with both Nirguna and Saguna  
aspects, who sang and danced in ecstasy seeing His own nature. And he freely  
shared that ecstasy with others. Many have stopped short to describe Brahman  
(being indescribable) but Sri Ramakrishna described Brahman in so many  
different ways.   
The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna is a veritable nectar of devotion and knowledge  
... Kathamrita, the nectar of words.

There is one saying in Tamizh, by Tirumoolar I suppose, Please correct me if I  
may be wrong.   
"Arindadu chiridalavu Alavu, Ariyaadadu Ulagalavu" What we know is just very  
little, and what is unknown is as much/big as this universe.   
Thats why Sri Thyagaraj sang, _" Endaro Mahanubhavulu"_   
general meaning of the song goes thus:  _In this gem of a poem, Thyagaraja, described the greatness of the devotees  
through the ages. He pays his salutations to the great men who live in all the  
ages, A yogi attains and enjoys paramananda by reaching the stage of samadhi  
when in the course of sahasra chakra the power of kundalam and maheswara are  
joined together from where at flood of nectar is released. In the soundarya  
Lahiri, Shankara Bhagwat Sahesrarey praises ambal as Padma Sahahasi, Padya  
Vihase. True devotees are persons who have attained this stage.   
Rama is handsome like manmada, He has a majestic walk, and we should see him  
clearly. Those who are engaged in Samagana should do Rama's bhajan through  
music based on ragam, bhava and laya, The poet says that devotion means to  
surrender you lotus like mind at his feet,   
We should understand that paramatma lives in all the living things and  
therefore we should live with love and friendship. We should understand the  
meaning and greatness of the religion after careful study and praise the glory  
of Rama with a peaceful mind There will be many men, Who knowing the greatness  
of Shri Rama, have understood that religion without bhakti is meaningless.  
There will be any devotees who fall into the above category who by means of  
true bhakti are able to derive boundless joy by meditation on him.   
I bow to all these great men and my salutation are to the immortal men who  
through bhakti are totally devoted to Rama and who are close Thayagaraja. My  
salutations to his dear followers and worshippers_   
Internet sources   
Salutations to all great souls of all ages   
My beloved Ramana, Salutations to you, in whom who I see all

what are the indicators that a person is self-realized?  
Silent Green Garu,   
Now this is really a very good question.   
Few indicators of a self-realised persons according to me   
a) They donot find happiness in external objects   
b) they live a very simple life and maintain austerity and simplicity.   
c) no attachment towards wealth etc   
d) for them god/self is only business they are living in this world and  
nothing else bother's them.   
e) they live their life by begging alms if needed also.   
f) they renounce "women and gold"   
..... list can go on and on   
Now it depends on our prarabdha karma to find out self-realised jnanis in this  
world.   
If our prarabdha is good (ofcourse it is good for all members in our forum)  
then we find real self-realised jnani like guru ramana   
If our prarabdha is sick then we may settle in some fake swamiji's (Ex: sex  
scam hit swami nityananda) feet and ruin our spiritual journey which can  
demoralise us to great extent.   
Now if you show me a guru and ask me whether he is really self-realised or not  
then my answer is I DONOT KNOW.   
Because he may tell you something but he may actually may not implement the  
same or he may secretly enjoy 'women and gold'   
Maybe other members also can give their opinions so that we can have more  
clear picture regarding this.

If it is difficult to find out what is mithya, let us find out which is nithya  
or true. At least we would not go out of our way. ( That you are)

In a dream state you are likely to have dream realisation only...mithya.   
A person goes to dream and after waking up says that he met a sage, did  
penance and became self-realised. His wife congratulates him and prints a  
certificate for the dream realisation. The wife encourages him to get some  
more certificates in future. That way her husband's ascetic tendencies will be  
satisfied and he will not leave her. The person said that with proper  
orientation of the mind he will try to get some more realisations in future  
dreams.   
If this present world is exactly like the dream world, many of us are likely  
to get dream certificates, may be more than one.

Really, subconsciously, most of the spiritual aspirants, even though they may  
not even be associated with "these" organisations which give enlightenment  
certificates, they still get caught in Self Realisation, trying to become  
"Something" which is endless.   
Its simply wisdom. It is our nature. Instead we try, try and keep trying....   
Sharanagati, thats the best way, Giving up. Just be.   
All else will happen. So what for us, the real Self. why to analyse them,  
everything is perfect and happening perfectly.   
quiescence of mind is our nature. Where nothing raises up. whenever 'I' raises  
up, just get it back in to Self.   
The Self being tutor, watchman, police to Self itself. Let not the 'I' escape  
out. Let it be in the divine prison and let it get merged with Self.   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Bhagavan Ramana said: 1\. The Real is only Atma Swarupam. The world, jiva and Iswara   
(personal god) are all imaginations. All the three appear and   
disappear simultaneously. Answer to the Question 16 of M.S. Pillai.   
(First Part)   
Bhagavan Ramana then proceeds to write the second part: 2\. Where there is no I-thought even for a trice, is Swarupam.   
That is also called Maunam. Swarupam is the world, Swarupam   
is I. Swarupam is Iswara. All are Siva Swarupam.   
So, Arunachala is only a Hill, when one has got I thought. When   
there is no I thought, where there is total silence, it is Swarupam.   
So Aruna Hill appears both ways to a person and a Brahma Jnani.   
The same will apply to pot and mud and snake and rope too.   
When a person looks at the pot, it is pot. When a person looks   
at the rope, firs it is snake only. When the 'true knowledge' is   
attained, they are mud and rope respectively.   
Arunachala Siva.

Let us end this discussion with the following saying of Sri Ramakrishna: It is the unwavering conviction of the jnani that Brahman alone is real and  
the world illusory. All these names and forms are illusory, like a dream. What  
Brahman is cannot be described. One cannot even say that Brahman is a Person.  
This is the opinion of the jnanis, the followers of Vedanta philosophy. But  
the bhaktas accept all the sates of consciousness. They take the waking state  
to be real also. They don't think the world to be illusory, like a dream. They  
say that the universe is a manifestation of God's power and glory. God has  
created all these -- sky, stars, moon, sun, mountains, ocean, men, and  
animals. They constitute His glory. He is within us, in our hearts. Again, He  
is outside. The most advanced devotees say that He Himself has become all this  
-- the twenty-four cosmic principles, the universe, and all living beings. The  
devotee of God wants to eat the sugar, and not to become the sugar.

The devotee of God wants to eat the sugar, and not to become the sugar.  
This is one difference between ramakrishna and ramana maharshi.   
Quote  
In day-by-day bhagavan tells   
 **They hold that they must exist and God must exist, but how is that  
possible? It seems that they must all remain for ever doing service in  
Vaikunta, but how many of them are to do service and where would there be room  
for all these Vaishnavites? "**   
Bhagavan said this laughing, and then, after a pause, he added, "On the other  
hand, Advaita does not mean that a man must always sit in samadhi and never  
engage in action. Many things are necessary to keep up the life of the body,  
and action can never be avoided. Nor is bhakti ruled out in Advaita.   
Shankara is rightly regarded as the foremost exponent of Advaita, and yet look  
at the number of shrines he visited (action), and the devotional songs he  
wrote."  
Anyhow as i said earlier there are N number of school of thoughts in Indian  
Philosphy where each school tells that their philosphy is best and perfect.   
It depends on our nature to choose one school and follow their teachings.   
Few famous schools In Indian Philosphy   
a) advaita (adi sankara,ramana maharshi,sri sundara chaitanya swami...)   
b) dvaita ( iscon and in general vaishnavaites)   
c) Vishishtadvaita ( Ramanuja)   
d) Dvaitadvaita ( Nimbarka)   
e) Buddhist philosophy   
f) Raja Yoga ( Yoga Sutras of Patanjali)   
g) Samkhya ( Sage Kapila)   
h) Cārvāka ( Madhavacharya) (Carvaka believed there was no afterlife, no life  
after death)   
.... still there are totally atleast > 25 schools

Ramakrishna was simply telling what vaishnavites say. he was like a child, he  
would just believe anyone -- if they are devotees of God.   
If you see Ramakrishna's life. .. I cannot imagine someone who is a greater  
devotee than Ramakrishna. .. and Ramakrishna would everytime merge in total  
samadhi!   
ofcourse he would say "I want to eat sugar and not be sugar"   
but every now and then, at the first sip of God's Love, he would be lost in  
nirvikalpa samadhi.   
Even the gopis used to sometimes say "I am Krishna" !   
When one goes very close to God, one cannot stop oneself from merging in God!  
Its impossible!   
The little ego some devotees maintain. .. is just prarabdha. .. its like a  
burnt rope, Ramakrishna used to say.   
Ramakrishna is an example of perfect surrender. .. he would go to a zoo and  
the moment he sees a tiger, he would drift into total samadhi... and perhaps  
fall down !   
Ramakrishna's love for God is a true example. One just needs to read his  
gospel to understand the True meaning of Love of God. I feel its no less than  
Bhagavatam! So divine. From first page to last page is just love of God!   
At the same time, Ramana was also a great devotee. He showed Sharanagatha  
bhakti. Very rarely we would find him going into madhura aspect. .. in  
Aksharamanimalai where he touches upon madhura Bhakti. .. even there he is  
mostly singing in absolute Sharanagathi.   
Love!   
Silence

The life of Sri Ramakrishna is a combination of jnana and ecstatic devotion.   
Sri Ramakrishna is perhaps the only saint who has worshipped so many Gods and  
Goddesses together with such a great intensity of devotion and at the same  
time pursued advaita sadhana. The knowledge of advaita did not reduce the  
ecstatic bhakti of Sri Ramakrishna. As he was a child of the Divine Mother, so  
he remained as her child only. Sri Ramakrishna's devotion for Sri Krishna  
reached the height of Mahabhava, the highest devotional stage of Bhakti  
mentioned in the Vaishnava literature. It is said that Sri Radha, Sri  
Chaitanya and Sri Ramakrishna are the only three who has reached the  
Mahabhava. Listening to scriptures of Shiva used to take Sri Ramakrishna to  
such deep samadhi as if he will never come back. So he often told the devotee  
to chant stotras of Devi to bring the mind down.   
In a single life Sri Ramakrishna had the vision of Divine Mother, Sri Krishna,  
Lord Shiva, Sri Radha, Sri Chaitanya and Nithyananda, Sri Rama, Jesus Christ,  
Buddha and many more. And combine it with Advaita. Sri Ramakrishna is a  
combination of the essence of all major religions and sects.   
To understand Sri Ramakrishna one has to have a devotion as transparent as  
pure water which is at the same time fathomless, on which any Gods and  
Goddesses can be imprinted. It is equally amenable to bhakti and jnana.  
Bhagavan Ramana used to walk all by himself till the end, but Sri Ramakrishna  
always had an attendent; for his moods were varied, "Bhava Sagara", and  
anytime his mind used to surge to samadhi losing all sense of external world.  
He once fell down during samadhi and injured his arm.   
Many have slighted the visions of Sri Ramakrishna, including Narendranath  
himself in the beginning. Who can fathom such mysteries? Sri Ramakrishna  
continued to have visions even after Advaita realisation. And many of his  
visions used to come true. He was Brahman Himself with both Nirguna and Saguna  
aspects, who sang and danced in ecstasy seeing His own nature. And he freely  
shared that ecstasy with others. Many have stopped short to describe Brahman  
(being indescribable) but Sri Ramakrishna described Brahman in so many  
different ways.   
The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna is a veritable nectar of devotion and knowledge  
... Kathamrita, the nectar of words.

There is one saying in Tamizh, by Tirumoolar I suppose, Please correct me if I  
may be wrong.   
"Arindadu chiridalavu Alavu, Ariyaadadu Ulagalavu" What we know is just very  
little, and what is unknown is as much/big as this universe.   
Thats why Sri Thyagaraj sang, _" Endaro Mahanubhavulu"_   
general meaning of the song goes thus:  _In this gem of a poem, Thyagaraja, described the greatness of the devotees  
through the ages. He pays his salutations to the great men who live in all the  
ages, A yogi attains and enjoys paramananda by reaching the stage of samadhi  
when in the course of sahasra chakra the power of kundalam and maheswara are  
joined together from where at flood of nectar is released. In the soundarya  
Lahiri, Shankara Bhagwat Sahesrarey praises ambal as Padma Sahahasi, Padya  
Vihase. True devotees are persons who have attained this stage.   
Rama is handsome like manmada, He has a majestic walk, and we should see him  
clearly. Those who are engaged in Samagana should do Rama's bhajan through  
music based on ragam, bhava and laya, The poet says that devotion means to  
surrender you lotus like mind at his feet,   
We should understand that paramatma lives in all the living things and  
therefore we should live with love and friendship. We should understand the  
meaning and greatness of the religion after careful study and praise the glory  
of Rama with a peaceful mind There will be many men, Who knowing the greatness  
of Shri Rama, have understood that religion without bhakti is meaningless.  
There will be any devotees who fall into the above category who by means of  
true bhakti are able to derive boundless joy by meditation on him.   
I bow to all these great men and my salutation are to the immortal men who  
through bhakti are totally devoted to Rama and who are close Thayagaraja. My  
salutations to his dear followers and worshippers_   
Internet sources   
Salutations to all great souls of all ages   
My beloved Ramana, Salutations to you, in whom who I see all
