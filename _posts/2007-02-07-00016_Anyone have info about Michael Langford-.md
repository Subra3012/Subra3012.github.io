## Anyone have info about Michael Langford?

Recently I came across a book called "The Most Rapid and Direct Method To  
Eternal Bliss" by Michael  
Langford:http://astore.amazon.com/powerfulspiri-20/detail/B000KMAUFI/002-9663457-4851248   
According to the author, the author is a follower of Sri Ramana Maharshi and  
became enlightened in early 2004. The methods described in his book are indeed  
very attractive. But I feel he is trying hard to promote his book: creating a  
bunch of not-quite-useful Amazon.com Listmania! Lists and putting his book as  
the first one in the lists, "boasting" his methods being superior than other  
sages' including Maharshi and so on. I don't mean to offend or attack someone  
who really is a realized person or a real sage. But I just don't feel quite  
comfortable to see such commercial-like acts happening. At least, I believe  
Sri Ramana Maharshi would not do someting like these. Any information about  
this author are welcome!

Have you even read the book? He never says "his methods" are anything other

any method to be his own.

May be the instructions by the author are correct. However it is the vasanas  
who determine whether they work or not. If Michael really lost his body mind  
identification early 2004, awareness will not let him claim enlightenment.   
So many times the deathexperience similar to Bhagavan's happened to me. I  
tried to respond like He did but fear always takes over and the whole thing  
ends up as a bad trip. This means vasanas are still active. It is all not in  
our hands

Do not take these statement like "Ramana is my guru" for granted. Such  
statements have as much value as people to whom Jesus is the real thing or  
Muhammed is the real thing. Michael just made a projection of Ramana and is  
thus guided by his own creation. Probably this Ramana told him he is  
enlightened.

Bravo. ..Yam   
Somebody asked Swami Dayanand....how can you define truth... bcos if truth is  
going to defined then it will be thru words which are limited. ....words are  
limited. .understanding is limited..   
Any definition will have a negation, an opposite view point...   
Dayanandaji said..."something which cannot be negated is truth"....

I have recently found his book and love it!!!   
I am honestly concerned about his ego, I mean he says stuff like   
"That secret and how to break free of that ancient human trap   
is taught in the book "The Most Rapid and Direct Means to Eternal Bliss"....   
For human consciousness to be transformed   
a new and effective solution must be introduced.   
A new and effective solution has been introduced.   
You can read about the new and effective solution   
in the book   
"The Most Rapid and Direct Means to Eternal Bliss"   
Then his amazon section says "This is the book that started a spiritual  
revolution"   
I wonder.... I mean his book touches me deeply.   
Anyway I am wondering his "loving all" method is something he made up or got  
from Ramana.   
peace,

I suggest you inquire, "Who is touched so deeply by this book?   
Some 5-6 years ago, when I read books by Papaji, Balsekar and teachers like  
them, I was touched so deeply. Everything became clear. I felt free. I felt  
unburdened. Till I realized it was all Ego that was so touched. Ego had become  
the knower!   
Ego told me, take a seat and rest! You are already what you looking for. In  
other words, "abide in Ego".   
Have a good Day BB

"I suggest you inquire, "Who is touched so deeply by this book?"   
Good question-   
When I ask that question, there is just an experience of spaciousness.   
That is so great that you found freedom from reading some books!

Hiya blissboy   
I think that experience of spaciousness might be a positive move upwards  
[metaphor].   
If everything is the Self, the whole percieved world is a picture within us, a  
picture made by the mind out of sense impressions, then this sense of  
spaciuosness could be an the begining of an awareness of the Self.   
The Self is the Universe, is All of everything.All that we ever experience is  
the Self. Vast, eternal, all pervading. really all we experience is the Self.   
 I went upstairs and got the book "Ramana mahrishi and the path of Self  
Knowledge" I opened it more or less randomly and here is where it opened!!!  
This is what it says!!!   
Page 99 i   
instructions to FH Humpries.   
 H. Master can I help the world?   
Bh.Help yourself and you will help the world.   
H. I wish to help the world. Shall I not be helpful?   
Bh. Yes Helping yourself you help the world.You are in the world, you are the  
world.You are not different from the world,nor is the world different from  
you.   
H. [aftre a pause] Master can I perform miiracals as Sri Krisna and Jesus did  
before ?   
Bh. Did any of them, when he performed them,feel it was he who was performing  
them?   
H. No Master.   
 Ramana says YOU ARE THE WORLD!   
Elsewhere he says the Self is the screen upon which the picture of the world  
is projected!   
He says that the seer of the world, the Aham Vritti [ego] is also on the  
screen.   
So maybe your experience of spaciousness is the beginning of an expansiion of  
consciousness   
Peace   
Mick

Captmj, ask Swami Dayanand whether he he thinks there exists a concept in this

As far as I know any concept can be broken by a person who act from awareness.

Recently I came across a book called "The Most Rapid and Direct Method To  
Eternal Bliss" by Michael  
Langford:http://astore.amazon.com/powerfulspiri-20/detail/B000KMAUFI/002-9663457-4851248   
According to the author, the author is a follower of Sri Ramana Maharshi and  
became enlightened in early 2004. The methods described in his book are indeed  
very attractive. But I feel he is trying hard to promote his book: creating a  
bunch of not-quite-useful Amazon.com Listmania! Lists and putting his book as  
the first one in the lists, "boasting" his methods being superior than other  
sages' including Maharshi and so on. I don't mean to offend or attack someone  
who really is a realized person or a real sage. But I just don't feel quite  
comfortable to see such commercial-like acts happening. At least, I believe  
Sri Ramana Maharshi would not do someting like these. Any information about  
this author are welcome!   
Have you even read the book? He never says "his methods" are anything other  
than what Maharshi and others have taught. I never saw a hint of him claiming  
any method to be his own.

Mike

Michael Langford is the real thing but I invite you to verify this for  
yourself. Over the past decade he has devoted thousands of hours to helping  
people in online discussion groups focused on Ramana Maharshi, which is how I  
found out about him. He is not commercializing his material, as everything he  
has written is available freely on the web. He regards Ramana Maharshi as his  
guru and has done a tremendous service by pointing out a way to practice that  
is abundantly documented in the works of Ramana, illustrated further by  
Muruganar, Sadhu Om and Annamalami Swami, but which is missed by many  
commentators. An index to Michael Langford's writings can be found on a page  
titled Awareness Watching Awareness at this address: http://www.albigen.com/uarelove/   
Best wishes to all.   
Do not take these statement like "Ramana is my guru" for granted. Such  
statements have as much value as people to whom Jesus is the real thing or  
Muhammed is the real thing. Michael just made a projection of Ramana and is  
thus guided by his own creation. Probably this Ramana told him he is  
enlightened.

Bravo. ..Yam   
Somebody asked Swami Dayanand....how can you define truth... bcos if truth is  
going to defined then it will be thru words which are limited. ....words are  
limited. .understanding is limited..   
Any definition will have a negation, an opposite view point...   
Dayanandaji said..."something which cannot be negated is truth"....

I am honestly concerned about his ego, I mean he says stuff like

For human consciousness to be transformed   
a new and effective solution must be introduced.

You can read about the new and effective solution

I wonder.... I mean his book touches me deeply.

I suggest you inquire, "Who is touched so deeply by this book?   
Some 5-6 years ago, when I read books by Papaji, Balsekar and teachers like  
them, I was touched so deeply. Everything became clear. I felt free. I felt  
unburdened. Till I realized it was all Ego that was so touched. Ego had become  
the knower!   
Ego told me, take a seat and rest! You are already what you looking for. In  
other words, "abide in Ego".   
Have a good Day BB

"I suggest you inquire, "Who is touched so deeply by this book?"   
Good question-   
When I ask that question, there is just an experience of spaciousness.   
That is so great that you found freedom from reading some books!

Hiya blissboy   
I think that experience of spaciousness might be a positive move upwards  
[metaphor].   
If everything is the Self, the whole percieved world is a picture within us, a  
picture made by the mind out of sense impressions, then this sense of  
spaciuosness could be an the begining of an awareness of the Self.   
The Self is the Universe, is All of everything.All that we ever experience is  
the Self. Vast, eternal, all pervading. really all we experience is the Self.   
 I went upstairs and got the book "Ramana mahrishi and the path of Self  
Knowledge" I opened it more or less randomly and here is where it opened!!!  
This is what it says!!!   
Page 99 i   
instructions to FH Humpries.   
 H. Master can I help the world?   
Bh.Help yourself and you will help the world.   
H. I wish to help the world. Shall I not be helpful?   
Bh. Yes Helping yourself you help the world.You are in the world, you are the  
world.You are not different from the world,nor is the world different from  
you.   
H. [aftre a pause] Master can I perform miiracals as Sri Krisna and Jesus did  
before ?   
Bh. Did any of them, when he performed them,feel it was he who was performing  
them?   
H. No Master.   
 Ramana says YOU ARE THE WORLD!   
Elsewhere he says the Self is the screen upon which the picture of the world  
is projected!   
He says that the seer of the world, the Aham Vritti [ego] is also on the  
screen.   
So maybe your experience of spaciousness is the beginning of an expansiion of  
consciousness   
Peace   
Mick

Captmj, ask Swami Dayanand whether he he thinks there exists a concept in this  
creation that cannot be negated.   
As far as I know any concept can be broken by a person who act from awareness.

Is this the same Micheal Langford who wrote the photography books?   
I checked out the link, and there seems to be nothing new in anything he is  
saying, but not having read more than the excerpt, I would not try to pass any  
sort of judgment on it. Still, when people talk of experiencing complete  
enlightenment, one should take it with a grain of salt.   
Also, a thing to consider: Anyone with even a very partial awakening, one of  
the most noticeable things about them will be the warmth and intimacy they  
convey in everything they say and do.

statements have as much value as people to whom Jesus is the real thing or  
Muhammed is the real thing. Michael just made a projection of Ramana and is  
thus guided by his own creation. Probably this Ramana told him he is  
enlightened.

I suggest you inquire, "Who is touched so deeply by this book?   
Some 5-6 years ago, when I read books by Papaji, Balsekar and teachers like  
them, I was touched so deeply. Everything became clear. I felt free. I felt  
unburdened. Till I realized it was all Ego that was so touched. Ego had become  
the knower!   
Ego told me, take a seat and rest! You are already what you looking for. In  
other words, "abide in Ego".   
Have a good Day BB

"I suggest you inquire, "Who is touched so deeply by this book?"   
Good question-   
When I ask that question, there is just an experience of spaciousness.   
That is so great that you found freedom from reading some books!

Hiya blissboy   
I think that experience of spaciousness might be a positive move upwards  
[metaphor].   
If everything is the Self, the whole percieved world is a picture within us, a  
picture made by the mind out of sense impressions, then this sense of  
spaciuosness could be an the begining of an awareness of the Self.   
The Self is the Universe, is All of everything.All that we ever experience is  
the Self. Vast, eternal, all pervading. really all we experience is the Self.   
 I went upstairs and got the book "Ramana mahrishi and the path of Self  
Knowledge" I opened it more or less randomly and here is where it opened!!!  
This is what it says!!!   
Page 99 i   
instructions to FH Humpries.   
 H. Master can I help the world?   
Bh.Help yourself and you will help the world.   
H. I wish to help the world. Shall I not be helpful?   
Bh. Yes Helping yourself you help the world.You are in the world, you are the  
world.You are not different from the world,nor is the world different from  
you.   
H. [aftre a pause] Master can I perform miiracals as Sri Krisna and Jesus did  
before ?   
Bh. Did any of them, when he performed them,feel it was he who was performing  
them?   
H. No Master.   
 Ramana says YOU ARE THE WORLD!   
Elsewhere he says the Self is the screen upon which the picture of the world  
is projected!   
He says that the seer of the world, the Aham Vritti [ego] is also on the  
screen.   
So maybe your experience of spaciousness is the beginning of an expansiion of  
consciousness   
Peace   
Mick

Captmj, ask Swami Dayanand whether he he thinks there exists a concept in this  
creation that cannot be negated.   
As far as I know any concept can be broken by a person who act from awareness.

Recently I came across a book called "The Most Rapid and Direct Method To  
Eternal Bliss" by Michael  
Langford:http://astore.amazon.com/powerfulspiri-20/detail/B000KMAUFI/002-9663457-4851248   
According to the author, the author is a follower of Sri Ramana Maharshi and  
became enlightened in early 2004. The methods described in his book are indeed  
very attractive. But I feel he is trying hard to promote his book: creating a  
bunch of not-quite-useful Amazon.com Listmania! Lists and putting his book as  
the first one in the lists, "boasting" his methods being superior than other  
sages' including Maharshi and so on. I don't mean to offend or attack someone  
who really is a realized person or a real sage. But I just don't feel quite  
comfortable to see such commercial-like acts happening. At least, I believe  
Sri Ramana Maharshi would not do someting like these. Any information about  
this author are welcome!

Is this the same Micheal Langford who wrote the photography books?   
I checked out the link, and there seems to be nothing new in anything he is  
saying, but not having read more than the excerpt, I would not try to pass any  
sort of judgment on it. Still, when people talk of experiencing complete  
enlightenment, one should take it with a grain of salt.   
Also, a thing to consider: Anyone with even a very partial awakening, one of  
the most noticeable things about them will be the warmth and intimacy they  
convey in everything they say and do.

Michael Langford is the real thing but I invite you to verify this for  
yourself. Over the past decade he has devoted thousands of hours to helping  
people in online discussion groups focused on Ramana Maharshi, which is how I  
found out about him. He is not commercializing his material, as everything he  
has written is available freely on the web. He regards Ramana Maharshi as his  
guru and has done a tremendous service by pointing out a way to practice that  
is abundantly documented in the works of Ramana, illustrated further by  
Muruganar, Sadhu Om and Annamalami Swami, but which is missed by many  
commentators. An index to Michael Langford's writings can be found on a page  
titled Awareness Watching Awareness at this address: http://www.albigen.com/uarelove/   
Best wishes to all.

May be the instructions by the author are correct. However it is the vasanas  
who determine whether they work or not. If Michael really lost his body mind  
identification early 2004, awareness will not let him claim enlightenment.   
So many times the deathexperience similar to Bhagavan's happened to me. I  
tried to respond like He did but fear always takes over and the whole thing  
ends up as a bad trip. This means vasanas are still active. It is all not in  
our hands

Good question-   
When I ask that question, there is just an experience of spaciousness.

Hiya blissboy   
I think that experience of spaciousness might be a positive move upwards  
[metaphor].   
If everything is the Self, the whole percieved world is a picture within us, a  
picture made by the mind out of sense impressions, then this sense of  
spaciuosness could be an the begining of an awareness of the Self.   
The Self is the Universe, is All of everything.All that we ever experience is  
the Self. Vast, eternal, all pervading. really all we experience is the Self.   
 I went upstairs and got the book "Ramana mahrishi and the path of Self  
Knowledge" I opened it more or less randomly and here is where it opened!!!  
This is what it says!!!   
Page 99 i   
instructions to FH Humpries.   
 H. Master can I help the world?   
Bh.Help yourself and you will help the world.   
H. I wish to help the world. Shall I not be helpful?   
Bh. Yes Helping yourself you help the world.You are in the world, you are the  
world.You are not different from the world,nor is the world different from  
you.   
H. [aftre a pause] Master can I perform miiracals as Sri Krisna and Jesus did  
before ?   
Bh. Did any of them, when he performed them,feel it was he who was performing  
them?   
H. No Master.   
 Ramana says YOU ARE THE WORLD!   
Elsewhere he says the Self is the screen upon which the picture of the world  
is projected!   
He says that the seer of the world, the Aham Vritti [ego] is also on the  
screen.   
So maybe your experience of spaciousness is the beginning of an expansiion of

Recently I came across a book called "The Most Rapid and Direct Method To  
Eternal Bliss" by Michael  
Langford:http://astore.amazon.com/powerfulspiri-20/detail/B000KMAUFI/002-9663457-4851248   
According to the author, the author is a follower of Sri Ramana Maharshi and  
became enlightened in early 2004. The methods described in his book are indeed  
very attractive. But I feel he is trying hard to promote his book: creating a  
bunch of not-quite-useful Amazon.com Listmania! Lists and putting his book as  
the first one in the lists, "boasting" his methods being superior than other  
sages' including Maharshi and so on. I don't mean to offend or attack someone  
who really is a realized person or a real sage. But I just don't feel quite  
comfortable to see such commercial-like acts happening. At least, I believe  
Sri Ramana Maharshi would not do someting like these. Any information about  
this author are welcome!

Just one question...does a enlightened person say that he/ she is  
enlightened...shud a enlightened person say I am enlightened..   
are we so gullible...

Is this the same Micheal Langford who wrote the photography books?   
I checked out the link, and there seems to be nothing new in anything he is  
saying, but not having read more than the excerpt, I would not try to pass any  
sort of judgment on it. Still, when people talk of experiencing complete  
enlightenment, one should take it with a grain of salt.   
Also, a thing to consider: Anyone with even a very partial awakening, one of  
the most noticeable things about them will be the warmth and intimacy they  
convey in everything they say and do.

Michael Langford is the real thing but I invite you to verify this for  
yourself. Over the past decade he has devoted thousands of hours to helping  
people in online discussion groups focused on Ramana Maharshi, which is how I  
found out about him. He is not commercializing his material, as everything he  
has written is available freely on the web. He regards Ramana Maharshi as his  
guru and has done a tremendous service by pointing out a way to practice that  
is abundantly documented in the works of Ramana, illustrated further by  
Muruganar, Sadhu Om and Annamalami Swami, but which is missed by many  
commentators. An index to Michael Langford's writings can be found on a page  
titled Awareness Watching Awareness at this address: http://www.albigen.com/uarelove/   
Best wishes to all.

May be the instructions by the author are correct. However it is the vasanas  
who determine whether they work or not. If Michael really lost his body mind  
identification early 2004, awareness will not let him claim enlightenment.   
So many times the deathexperience similar to Bhagavan's happened to me. I  
tried to respond like He did but fear always takes over and the whole thing  
ends up as a bad trip. This means vasanas are still active. It is all not in  
our hands

Do not take these statement like "Ramana is my guru" for granted. Such  
statements have as much value as people to whom Jesus is the real thing or  
Muhammed is the real thing. Michael just made a projection of Ramana and is  
thus guided by his own creation. Probably this Ramana told him he is  
enlightened.

I am honestly concerned about his ego, I mean he says stuff like   
"That secret and how to break free of that ancient human trap

I suggest you inquire, "Who is touched so deeply by this book?   
Some 5-6 years ago, when I read books by Papaji, Balsekar and teachers like  
them, I was touched so deeply. Everything became clear. I felt free. I felt  
unburdened. Till I realized it was all Ego that was so touched. Ego had become

Ego told me, take a seat and rest! You are already what you looking for. In

Is this the same Micheal Langford who wrote the photography books?   
I checked out the link, and there seems to be nothing new in anything he is  
saying, but not having read more than the excerpt, I would not try to pass any  
sort of judgment on it. Still, when people talk of experiencing complete  
enlightenment, one should take it with a grain of salt.   
Also, a thing to consider: Anyone with even a very partial awakening, one of  
the most noticeable things about them will be the warmth and intimacy they  
convey in everything they say and do.

any method to be his own.

May be the instructions by the author are correct. However it is the vasanas  
who determine whether they work or not. If Michael really lost his body mind  
identification early 2004, awareness will not let him claim enlightenment.   
So many times the deathexperience similar to Bhagavan's happened to me. I  
tried to respond like He did but fear always takes over and the whole thing  
ends up as a bad trip. This means vasanas are still active. It is all not in  
our hands

Do not take these statement like "Ramana is my guru" for granted. Such  
statements have as much value as people to whom Jesus is the real thing or  
Muhammed is the real thing. Michael just made a projection of Ramana and is  
thus guided by his own creation. Probably this Ramana told him he is  
enlightened.

Bravo. ..Yam   
Somebody asked Swami Dayanand....how can you define truth... bcos if truth is  
going to defined then it will be thru words which are limited. ....words are  
limited. .understanding is limited..   
Any definition will have a negation, an opposite view point...   
Dayanandaji said..."something which cannot be negated is truth"....

I am honestly concerned about his ego, I mean he says stuff like   
"That secret and how to break free of that ancient human trap

For human consciousness to be transformed

You can read about the new and effective solution

I wonder.... I mean his book touches me deeply.

I suggest you inquire, "Who is touched so deeply by this book?   
Some 5-6 years ago, when I read books by Papaji, Balsekar and teachers like  
them, I was touched so deeply. Everything became clear. I felt free. I felt  
unburdened. Till I realized it was all Ego that was so touched. Ego had become  
the knower!   
Ego told me, take a seat and rest! You are already what you looking for. In  
other words, "abide in Ego".   
Have a good Day BB

"I suggest you inquire, "Who is touched so deeply by this book?"   
Good question-   
When I ask that question, there is just an experience of spaciousness.   
That is so great that you found freedom from reading some books!

Hiya blissboy   
I think that experience of spaciousness might be a positive move upwards  
[metaphor].   
If everything is the Self, the whole percieved world is a picture within us, a  
picture made by the mind out of sense impressions, then this sense of  
spaciuosness could be an the begining of an awareness of the Self.   
The Self is the Universe, is All of everything.All that we ever experience is  
the Self. Vast, eternal, all pervading. really all we experience is the Self.   
 I went upstairs and got the book "Ramana mahrishi and the path of Self  
Knowledge" I opened it more or less randomly and here is where it opened!!!  
This is what it says!!!   
Page 99 i   
instructions to FH Humpries.   
 H. Master can I help the world?   
Bh.Help yourself and you will help the world.   
H. I wish to help the world. Shall I not be helpful?   
Bh. Yes Helping yourself you help the world.You are in the world, you are the  
world.You are not different from the world,nor is the world different from  
you.   
H. [aftre a pause] Master can I perform miiracals as Sri Krisna and Jesus did  
before ?   
Bh. Did any of them, when he performed them,feel it was he who was performing  
them?   
H. No Master.   
 Ramana says YOU ARE THE WORLD!   
Elsewhere he says the Self is the screen upon which the picture of the world  
is projected!   
He says that the seer of the world, the Aham Vritti [ego] is also on the  
screen.   
So maybe your experience of spaciousness is the beginning of an expansiion of  
consciousness   
Peace   
Mick

As far as I know any concept can be broken by a person who act from awareness.

Recently I came across a book called "The Most Rapid and Direct Method To  
Eternal Bliss" by Michael  
Langford:http://astore.amazon.com/powerfulspiri-20/detail/B000KMAUFI/002-9663457-4851248   
According to the author, the author is a follower of Sri Ramana Maharshi and  
became enlightened in early 2004. The methods described in his book are indeed  
very attractive. But I feel he is trying hard to promote his book: creating a  
bunch of not-quite-useful Amazon.com Listmania! Lists and putting his book as  
the first one in the lists, "boasting" his methods being superior than other  
sages' including Maharshi and so on. I don't mean to offend or attack someone  
who really is a realized person or a real sage. But I just don't feel quite  
comfortable to see such commercial-like acts happening. At least, I believe  
Sri Ramana Maharshi would not do someting like these. Any information about  
this author are welcome!   
Have you even read the book? He never says "his methods" are anything other  
than what Maharshi and others have taught. I never saw a hint of him claiming  
any method to be his own.   
Regards,   
Mike

May be the instructions by the author are correct. However it is the vasanas  
who determine whether they work or not. If Michael really lost his body mind  
identification early 2004, awareness will not let him claim enlightenment.   
So many times the deathexperience similar to Bhagavan's happened to me. I  
tried to respond like He did but fear always takes over and the whole thing  
ends up as a bad trip. This means vasanas are still active. It is all not in

Michael Langford is the real thing but I invite you to verify this for  
yourself. Over the past decade he has devoted thousands of hours to helping  
people in online discussion groups focused on Ramana Maharshi, which is how I  
found out about him. He is not commercializing his material, as everything he  
has written is available freely on the web. He regards Ramana Maharshi as his  
guru and has done a tremendous service by pointing out a way to practice that  
is abundantly documented in the works of Ramana, illustrated further by  
Muruganar, Sadhu Om and Annamalami Swami, but which is missed by many  
commentators. An index to Michael Langford's writings can be found on a page  
titled Awareness Watching Awareness at this address: http://www.albigen.com/uarelove/   
Best wishes to all.   
Do not take these statement like "Ramana is my guru" for granted. Such  
statements have as much value as people to whom Jesus is the real thing or  
Muhammed is the real thing. Michael just made a projection of Ramana and is  
thus guided by his own creation. Probably this Ramana told him he is  
enlightened.

Bravo. ..Yam   
Somebody asked Swami Dayanand....how can you define truth... bcos if truth is  
going to defined then it will be thru words which are limited. ....words are  
limited. .understanding is limited..   
Any definition will have a negation, an opposite view point...   
Dayanandaji said..."something which cannot be negated is truth"....

I am honestly concerned about his ego, I mean he says stuff like

For human consciousness to be transformed   
a new and effective solution must be introduced.

I wonder.... I mean his book touches me deeply.

I suggest you inquire, "Who is touched so deeply by this book?   
Some 5-6 years ago, when I read books by Papaji, Balsekar and teachers like  
them, I was touched so deeply. Everything became clear. I felt free. I felt  
unburdened. Till I realized it was all Ego that was so touched. Ego had become  
the knower!   
Ego told me, take a seat and rest! You are already what you looking for. In  
other words, "abide in Ego".   
Have a good Day BB

"I suggest you inquire, "Who is touched so deeply by this book?"   
Good question-   
When I ask that question, there is just an experience of spaciousness.   
That is so great that you found freedom from reading some books!

Hiya blissboy   
I think that experience of spaciousness might be a positive move upwards  
[metaphor].   
If everything is the Self, the whole percieved world is a picture within us, a  
picture made by the mind out of sense impressions, then this sense of  
spaciuosness could be an the begining of an awareness of the Self.   
The Self is the Universe, is All of everything.All that we ever experience is  
the Self. Vast, eternal, all pervading. really all we experience is the Self.   
 I went upstairs and got the book "Ramana mahrishi and the path of Self  
Knowledge" I opened it more or less randomly and here is where it opened!!!  
This is what it says!!!   
Page 99 i   
instructions to FH Humpries.   
 H. Master can I help the world?   
Bh.Help yourself and you will help the world.   
H. I wish to help the world. Shall I not be helpful?   
Bh. Yes Helping yourself you help the world.You are in the world, you are the  
world.You are not different from the world,nor is the world different from  
you.   
H. [aftre a pause] Master can I perform miiracals as Sri Krisna and Jesus did  
before ?   
Bh. Did any of them, when he performed them,feel it was he who was performing  
them?   
H. No Master.   
 Ramana says YOU ARE THE WORLD!   
Elsewhere he says the Self is the screen upon which the picture of the world  
is projected!   
He says that the seer of the world, the Aham Vritti [ego] is also on the  
screen.   
So maybe your experience of spaciousness is the beginning of an expansiion of  
consciousness   
Peace   
Mick

Captmj, ask Swami Dayanand whether he he thinks there exists a concept in this  
creation that cannot be negated.   
As far as I know any concept can be broken by a person who act from awareness.

Is this the same Micheal Langford who wrote the photography books?   
I checked out the link, and there seems to be nothing new in anything he is  
saying, but not having read more than the excerpt, I would not try to pass any  
sort of judgment on it. Still, when people talk of experiencing complete  
enlightenment, one should take it with a grain of salt.   
Also, a thing to consider: Anyone with even a very partial awakening, one of  
the most noticeable things about them will be the warmth and intimacy they  
convey in everything they say and do.

titled Awareness Watching Awareness at this address: http://www.albigen.com/uarelove/   
Best wishes to all.   
Do not take these statement like "Ramana is my guru" for granted. Such  
statements have as much value as people to whom Jesus is the real thing or  
Muhammed is the real thing. Michael just made a projection of Ramana and is  
thus guided by his own creation. Probably this Ramana told him he is  
enlightened.

I suggest you inquire, "Who is touched so deeply by this book?   
Some 5-6 years ago, when I read books by Papaji, Balsekar and teachers like  
them, I was touched so deeply. Everything became clear. I felt free. I felt  
unburdened. Till I realized it was all Ego that was so touched. Ego had become  
the knower!   
Ego told me, take a seat and rest! You are already what you looking for. In  
other words, "abide in Ego".   
Have a good Day BB

"I suggest you inquire, "Who is touched so deeply by this book?"   
Good question-   
When I ask that question, there is just an experience of spaciousness.   
That is so great that you found freedom from reading some books!

Hiya blissboy   
I think that experience of spaciousness might be a positive move upwards  
[metaphor].   
If everything is the Self, the whole percieved world is a picture within us, a  
picture made by the mind out of sense impressions, then this sense of  
spaciuosness could be an the begining of an awareness of the Self.   
The Self is the Universe, is All of everything.All that we ever experience is  
the Self. Vast, eternal, all pervading. really all we experience is the Self.   
 I went upstairs and got the book "Ramana mahrishi and the path of Self  
Knowledge" I opened it more or less randomly and here is where it opened!!!  
This is what it says!!!   
Page 99 i   
instructions to FH Humpries.   
 H. Master can I help the world?   
Bh.Help yourself and you will help the world.   
H. I wish to help the world. Shall I not be helpful?   
Bh. Yes Helping yourself you help the world.You are in the world, you are the  
world.You are not different from the world,nor is the world different from  
you.   
H. [aftre a pause] Master can I perform miiracals as Sri Krisna and Jesus did  
before ?   
Bh. Did any of them, when he performed them,feel it was he who was performing  
them?   
H. No Master.   
 Ramana says YOU ARE THE WORLD!   
Elsewhere he says the Self is the screen upon which the picture of the world  
is projected!   
He says that the seer of the world, the Aham Vritti [ego] is also on the  
screen.   
So maybe your experience of spaciousness is the beginning of an expansiion of  
consciousness   
Peace   
Mick

Captmj, ask Swami Dayanand whether he he thinks there exists a concept in this  
creation that cannot be negated.   
As far as I know any concept can be broken by a person who act from awareness.

Recently I came across a book called "The Most Rapid and Direct Method To  
Eternal Bliss" by Michael  
Langford:http://astore.amazon.com/powerfulspiri-20/detail/B000KMAUFI/002-9663457-4851248   
According to the author, the author is a follower of Sri Ramana Maharshi and  
became enlightened in early 2004. The methods described in his book are indeed  
very attractive. But I feel he is trying hard to promote his book: creating a  
bunch of not-quite-useful Amazon.com Listmania! Lists and putting his book as  
the first one in the lists, "boasting" his methods being superior than other  
sages' including Maharshi and so on. I don't mean to offend or attack someone  
who really is a realized person or a real sage. But I just don't feel quite  
comfortable to see such commercial-like acts happening. At least, I believe  
Sri Ramana Maharshi would not do someting like these. Any information about  
this author are welcome!

Is this the same Micheal Langford who wrote the photography books?   
I checked out the link, and there seems to be nothing new in anything he is  
saying, but not having read more than the excerpt, I would not try to pass any  
sort of judgment on it. Still, when people talk of experiencing complete  
enlightenment, one should take it with a grain of salt.   
Also, a thing to consider: Anyone with even a very partial awakening, one of  
the most noticeable things about them will be the warmth and intimacy they  
convey in everything they say and do.

Michael Langford is the real thing but I invite you to verify this for  
yourself. Over the past decade he has devoted thousands of hours to helping  
people in online discussion groups focused on Ramana Maharshi, which is how I  
found out about him. He is not commercializing his material, as everything he  
has written is available freely on the web. He regards Ramana Maharshi as his  
guru and has done a tremendous service by pointing out a way to practice that  
is abundantly documented in the works of Ramana, illustrated further by  
Muruganar, Sadhu Om and Annamalami Swami, but which is missed by many  
commentators. An index to Michael Langford's writings can be found on a page  
titled Awareness Watching Awareness at this address: http://www.albigen.com/uarelove/   
Best wishes to all.

May be the instructions by the author are correct. However it is the vasanas  
who determine whether they work or not. If Michael really lost his body mind  
identification early 2004, awareness will not let him claim enlightenment.   
So many times the deathexperience similar to Bhagavan's happened to me. I  
tried to respond like He did but fear always takes over and the whole thing  
ends up as a bad trip. This means vasanas are still active. It is all not in  
our hands

I suggest you inquire, "Who is touched so deeply by this book?   
Some 5-6 years ago, when I read books by Papaji, Balsekar and teachers like  
them, I was touched so deeply. Everything became clear. I felt free. I felt  
unburdened. Till I realized it was all Ego that was so touched. Ego had become  
the knower!   
Ego told me, take a seat and rest! You are already what you looking for. In  
other words, "abide in Ego".   
Have a good Day BB

Hiya blissboy   
I think that experience of spaciousness might be a positive move upwards  
[metaphor].   
If everything is the Self, the whole percieved world is a picture within us, a  
picture made by the mind out of sense impressions, then this sense of  
spaciuosness could be an the begining of an awareness of the Self.   
The Self is the Universe, is All of everything.All that we ever experience is  
the Self. Vast, eternal, all pervading. really all we experience is the Self.   
 I went upstairs and got the book "Ramana mahrishi and the path of Self  
Knowledge" I opened it more or less randomly and here is where it opened!!!  
This is what it says!!!   
Page 99 i   
instructions to FH Humpries.   
 H. Master can I help the world?   
Bh.Help yourself and you will help the world.   
H. I wish to help the world. Shall I not be helpful?   
Bh. Yes Helping yourself you help the world.You are in the world, you are the  
world.You are not different from the world,nor is the world different from  
you.   
H. [aftre a pause] Master can I perform miiracals as Sri Krisna and Jesus did  
before ?   
Bh. Did any of them, when he performed them,feel it was he who was performing  
them?   
H. No Master.   
 Ramana says YOU ARE THE WORLD!   
Elsewhere he says the Self is the screen upon which the picture of the world  
is projected!   
He says that the seer of the world, the Aham Vritti [ego] is also on the  
screen.   
So maybe your experience of spaciousness is the beginning of an expansiion of  
consciousness   
Peace

Recently I came across a book called "The Most Rapid and Direct Method To  
Eternal Bliss" by Michael  
Langford:http://astore.amazon.com/powerfulspiri-20/detail/B000KMAUFI/002-9663457-4851248   
According to the author, the author is a follower of Sri Ramana Maharshi and  
became enlightened in early 2004. The methods described in his book are indeed  
very attractive. But I feel he is trying hard to promote his book: creating a  
bunch of not-quite-useful Amazon.com Listmania! Lists and putting his book as  
the first one in the lists, "boasting" his methods being superior than other  
sages' including Maharshi and so on. I don't mean to offend or attack someone  
who really is a realized person or a real sage. But I just don't feel quite  
comfortable to see such commercial-like acts happening. At least, I believe  
Sri Ramana Maharshi would not do someting like these. Any information about  
this author are welcome!

Hello Michael...   
Just one question...does a enlightened person say that he/ she is  
enlightened...shud a enlightened person say I am enlightened..   
are we so gullible...

Is this the same Micheal Langford who wrote the photography books?   
I checked out the link, and there seems to be nothing new in anything he is  
saying, but not having read more than the excerpt, I would not try to pass any  
sort of judgment on it. Still, when people talk of experiencing complete  
enlightenment, one should take it with a grain of salt.   
Also, a thing to consider: Anyone with even a very partial awakening, one of  
the most noticeable things about them will be the warmth and intimacy they  
convey in everything they say and do.

Michael Langford is the real thing but I invite you to verify this for  
yourself. Over the past decade he has devoted thousands of hours to helping  
people in online discussion groups focused on Ramana Maharshi, which is how I  
found out about him. He is not commercializing his material, as everything he  
has written is available freely on the web. He regards Ramana Maharshi as his  
guru and has done a tremendous service by pointing out a way to practice that  
is abundantly documented in the works of Ramana, illustrated further by  
Muruganar, Sadhu Om and Annamalami Swami, but which is missed by many  
commentators. An index to Michael Langford's writings can be found on a page  
titled Awareness Watching Awareness at this address: http://www.albigen.com/uarelove/   
Best wishes to all.

any method to be his own.

May be the instructions by the author are correct. However it is the vasanas  
who determine whether they work or not. If Michael really lost his body mind  
identification early 2004, awareness will not let him claim enlightenment.   
So many times the deathexperience similar to Bhagavan's happened to me. I  
tried to respond like He did but fear always takes over and the whole thing  
ends up as a bad trip. This means vasanas are still active. It is all not in  
our hands

Do not take these statement like "Ramana is my guru" for granted. Such  
statements have as much value as people to whom Jesus is the real thing or  
Muhammed is the real thing. Michael just made a projection of Ramana and is  
thus guided by his own creation. Probably this Ramana told him he is  
enlightened.

I am honestly concerned about his ego, I mean he says stuff like   
"That secret and how to break free of that ancient human trap

For human consciousness to be transformed   
a new and effective solution must be introduced.

You can read about the new and effective solution

Then his amazon section says "This is the book that started a spiritual

I wonder.... I mean his book touches me deeply.

Recently I came across a book called "The Most Rapid and Direct Method To  
Eternal Bliss" by Michael  
Langford:http://astore.amazon.com/powerfulspiri-20/detail/B000KMAUFI/002-9663457-4851248   
According to the author, the author is a follower of Sri Ramana Maharshi and  
became enlightened in early 2004. The methods described in his book are indeed  
very attractive. But I feel he is trying hard to promote his book: creating a  
bunch of not-quite-useful Amazon.com Listmania! Lists and putting his book as  
the first one in the lists, "boasting" his methods being superior than other  
sages' including Maharshi and so on. I don't mean to offend or attack someone  
who really is a realized person or a real sage. But I just don't feel quite  
comfortable to see such commercial-like acts happening. At least, I believe  
Sri Ramana Maharshi would not do someting like these. Any information about  
this author are welcome!

Is this the same Micheal Langford who wrote the photography books?   
I checked out the link, and there seems to be nothing new in anything he is  
saying, but not having read more than the excerpt, I would not try to pass any  
sort of judgment on it. Still, when people talk of experiencing complete  
enlightenment, one should take it with a grain of salt.   
Also, a thing to consider: Anyone with even a very partial awakening, one of  
the most noticeable things about them will be the warmth and intimacy they  
convey in everything they say and do.

is abundantly documented in the works of Ramana, illustrated further by  
Muruganar, Sadhu Om and Annamalami Swami, but which is missed by many  
commentators. An index to Michael Langford's writings can be found on a page

any method to be his own.

May be the instructions by the author are correct. However it is the vasanas  
who determine whether they work or not. If Michael really lost his body mind  
identification early 2004, awareness will not let him claim enlightenment.   
So many times the deathexperience similar to Bhagavan's happened to me. I  
tried to respond like He did but fear always takes over and the whole thing  
ends up as a bad trip. This means vasanas are still active. It is all not in  
our hands

Do not take these statement like "Ramana is my guru" for granted. Such  
statements have as much value as people to whom Jesus is the real thing or  
Muhammed is the real thing. Michael just made a projection of Ramana and is  
thus guided by his own creation. Probably this Ramana told him he is  
enlightened.

Bravo. ..Yam   
Somebody asked Swami Dayanand....how can you define truth... bcos if truth is  
going to defined then it will be thru words which are limited. ....words are  
limited. .understanding is limited..   
Any definition will have a negation, an opposite view point...   
Dayanandaji said..."something which cannot be negated is truth"....

I have recently found his book and love it!!!   
I am honestly concerned about his ego, I mean he says stuff like   
"That secret and how to break free of that ancient human trap   
is taught in the book "The Most Rapid and Direct Means to Eternal Bliss"....   
For human consciousness to be transformed   
a new and effective solution must be introduced.   
A new and effective solution has been introduced.   
You can read about the new and effective solution   
in the book   
"The Most Rapid and Direct Means to Eternal Bliss"   
Then his amazon section says "This is the book that started a spiritual  
revolution"   
I wonder.... I mean his book touches me deeply.   
Anyway I am wondering his "loving all" method is something he made up or got  
from Ramana.

I suggest you inquire, "Who is touched so deeply by this book?   
Some 5-6 years ago, when I read books by Papaji, Balsekar and teachers like  
them, I was touched so deeply. Everything became clear. I felt free. I felt  
unburdened. Till I realized it was all Ego that was so touched. Ego had become  
the knower!   
Ego told me, take a seat and rest! You are already what you looking for. In  
other words, "abide in Ego".   
Have a good Day BB

"I suggest you inquire, "Who is touched so deeply by this book?"   
Good question-   
When I ask that question, there is just an experience of spaciousness.   
That is so great that you found freedom from reading some books!

Hiya blissboy   
I think that experience of spaciousness might be a positive move upwards  
[metaphor].   
If everything is the Self, the whole percieved world is a picture within us, a  
picture made by the mind out of sense impressions, then this sense of  
spaciuosness could be an the begining of an awareness of the Self.   
The Self is the Universe, is All of everything.All that we ever experience is  
the Self. Vast, eternal, all pervading. really all we experience is the Self.   
 I went upstairs and got the book "Ramana mahrishi and the path of Self  
Knowledge" I opened it more or less randomly and here is where it opened!!!  
This is what it says!!!   
Page 99 i   
instructions to FH Humpries.   
 H. Master can I help the world?   
Bh.Help yourself and you will help the world.   
H. I wish to help the world. Shall I not be helpful?   
Bh. Yes Helping yourself you help the world.You are in the world, you are the  
world.You are not different from the world,nor is the world different from  
you.   
H. [aftre a pause] Master can I perform miiracals as Sri Krisna and Jesus did  
before ?   
Bh. Did any of them, when he performed them,feel it was he who was performing  
them?   
H. No Master.   
 Ramana says YOU ARE THE WORLD!   
Elsewhere he says the Self is the screen upon which the picture of the world  
is projected!   
He says that the seer of the world, the Aham Vritti [ego] is also on the  
screen.   
So maybe your experience of spaciousness is the beginning of an expansiion of  
consciousness   
Peace   
Mick

Captmj, ask Swami Dayanand whether he he thinks there exists a concept in this

As far as I know any concept can be broken by a person who act from awareness.

Recently I came across a book called "The Most Rapid and Direct Method To  
Eternal Bliss" by Michael  
Langford:http://astore.amazon.com/powerfulspiri-20/detail/B000KMAUFI/002-9663457-4851248   
According to the author, the author is a follower of Sri Ramana Maharshi and  
became enlightened in early 2004. The methods described in his book are indeed  
very attractive. But I feel he is trying hard to promote his book: creating a  
bunch of not-quite-useful Amazon.com Listmania! Lists and putting his book as  
the first one in the lists, "boasting" his methods being superior than other  
sages' including Maharshi and so on. I don't mean to offend or attack someone  
who really is a realized person or a real sage. But I just don't feel quite  
comfortable to see such commercial-like acts happening. At least, I believe  
Sri Ramana Maharshi would not do someting like these. Any information about  
this author are welcome!   
Have you even read the book? He never says "his methods" are anything other  
than what Maharshi and others have taught. I never saw a hint of him claiming  
any method to be his own.

Mike

May be the instructions by the author are correct. However it is the vasanas  
who determine whether they work or not. If Michael really lost his body mind  
identification early 2004, awareness will not let him claim enlightenment.   
So many times the deathexperience similar to Bhagavan's happened to me. I  
tried to respond like He did but fear always takes over and the whole thing  
ends up as a bad trip. This means vasanas are still active. It is all not in

Do not take these statement like "Ramana is my guru" for granted. Such  
statements have as much value as people to whom Jesus is the real thing or  
Muhammed is the real thing. Michael just made a projection of Ramana and is  
thus guided by his own creation. Probably this Ramana told him he is  
enlightened.

Bravo. ..Yam   
Somebody asked Swami Dayanand....how can you define truth... bcos if truth is  
going to defined then it will be thru words which are limited. ....words are  
limited. .understanding is limited..   
Any definition will have a negation, an opposite view point...   
Dayanandaji said..."something which cannot be negated is truth"....

I am honestly concerned about his ego, I mean he says stuff like

I suggest you inquire, "Who is touched so deeply by this book?   
Some 5-6 years ago, when I read books by Papaji, Balsekar and teachers like  
them, I was touched so deeply. Everything became clear. I felt free. I felt  
unburdened. Till I realized it was all Ego that was so touched. Ego had become  
the knower!   
Ego told me, take a seat and rest! You are already what you looking for. In  
other words, "abide in Ego".   
Have a good Day BB

"I suggest you inquire, "Who is touched so deeply by this book?"   
Good question-   
When I ask that question, there is just an experience of spaciousness.   
That is so great that you found freedom from reading some books!

Hiya blissboy   
I think that experience of spaciousness might be a positive move upwards  
[metaphor].   
If everything is the Self, the whole percieved world is a picture within us, a  
picture made by the mind out of sense impressions, then this sense of  
spaciuosness could be an the begining of an awareness of the Self.   
The Self is the Universe, is All of everything.All that we ever experience is  
the Self. Vast, eternal, all pervading. really all we experience is the Self.   
 I went upstairs and got the book "Ramana mahrishi and the path of Self  
Knowledge" I opened it more or less randomly and here is where it opened!!!  
This is what it says!!!   
Page 99 i   
instructions to FH Humpries.   
 H. Master can I help the world?   
Bh.Help yourself and you will help the world.   
H. I wish to help the world. Shall I not be helpful?   
Bh. Yes Helping yourself you help the world.You are in the world, you are the  
world.You are not different from the world,nor is the world different from  
you.   
H. [aftre a pause] Master can I perform miiracals as Sri Krisna and Jesus did  
before ?   
Bh. Did any of them, when he performed them,feel it was he who was performing  
them?   
H. No Master.   
 Ramana says YOU ARE THE WORLD!   
Elsewhere he says the Self is the screen upon which the picture of the world  
is projected!   
He says that the seer of the world, the Aham Vritti [ego] is also on the  
screen.   
So maybe your experience of spaciousness is the beginning of an expansiion of  
consciousness   
Peace   
Mick

Captmj, ask Swami Dayanand whether he he thinks there exists a concept in this  
creation that cannot be negated.   
As far as I know any concept can be broken by a person who act from awareness.

Is this the same Micheal Langford who wrote the photography books?   
I checked out the link, and there seems to be nothing new in anything he is  
saying, but not having read more than the excerpt, I would not try to pass any  
sort of judgment on it. Still, when people talk of experiencing complete  
enlightenment, one should take it with a grain of salt.   
Also, a thing to consider: Anyone with even a very partial awakening, one of  
the most noticeable things about them will be the warmth and intimacy they  
convey in everything they say and do.

Michael Langford is the real thing but I invite you to verify this for  
yourself. Over the past decade he has devoted thousands of hours to helping  
people in online discussion groups focused on Ramana Maharshi, which is how I  
found out about him. He is not commercializing his material, as everything he  
has written is available freely on the web. He regards Ramana Maharshi as his  
guru and has done a tremendous service by pointing out a way to practice that  
is abundantly documented in the works of Ramana, illustrated further by  
Muruganar, Sadhu Om and Annamalami Swami, but which is missed by many  
commentators. An index to Michael Langford's writings can be found on a page  
titled Awareness Watching Awareness at this address: http://www.albigen.com/uarelove/   
Best wishes to all.   
Do not take these statement like "Ramana is my guru" for granted. Such  
statements have as much value as people to whom Jesus is the real thing or  
Muhammed is the real thing. Michael just made a projection of Ramana and is  
thus guided by his own creation. Probably this Ramana told him he is  
enlightened.

I suggest you inquire, "Who is touched so deeply by this book?   
Some 5-6 years ago, when I read books by Papaji, Balsekar and teachers like  
them, I was touched so deeply. Everything became clear. I felt free. I felt  
unburdened. Till I realized it was all Ego that was so touched. Ego had become  
the knower!   
Ego told me, take a seat and rest! You are already what you looking for. In  
other words, "abide in Ego".   
Have a good Day BB

"I suggest you inquire, "Who is touched so deeply by this book?"   
Good question-   
When I ask that question, there is just an experience of spaciousness.   
That is so great that you found freedom from reading some books!

Hiya blissboy   
I think that experience of spaciousness might be a positive move upwards  
[metaphor].   
If everything is the Self, the whole percieved world is a picture within us, a  
picture made by the mind out of sense impressions, then this sense of  
spaciuosness could be an the begining of an awareness of the Self.   
The Self is the Universe, is All of everything.All that we ever experience is  
the Self. Vast, eternal, all pervading. really all we experience is the Self.   
 I went upstairs and got the book "Ramana mahrishi and the path of Self  
Knowledge" I opened it more or less randomly and here is where it opened!!!  
This is what it says!!!   
Page 99 i   
instructions to FH Humpries.   
 H. Master can I help the world?   
Bh.Help yourself and you will help the world.   
H. I wish to help the world. Shall I not be helpful?   
Bh. Yes Helping yourself you help the world.You are in the world, you are the  
world.You are not different from the world,nor is the world different from  
you.   
H. [aftre a pause] Master can I perform miiracals as Sri Krisna and Jesus did  
before ?   
Bh. Did any of them, when he performed them,feel it was he who was performing  
them?   
H. No Master.   
 Ramana says YOU ARE THE WORLD!   
Elsewhere he says the Self is the screen upon which the picture of the world  
is projected!   
He says that the seer of the world, the Aham Vritti [ego] is also on the  
screen.   
So maybe your experience of spaciousness is the beginning of an expansiion of  
consciousness   
Peace   
Mick

Captmj, ask Swami Dayanand whether he he thinks there exists a concept in this  
creation that cannot be negated.   
As far as I know any concept can be broken by a person who act from awareness.

Recently I came across a book called "The Most Rapid and Direct Method To  
Eternal Bliss" by Michael  
Langford:http://astore.amazon.com/powerfulspiri-20/detail/B000KMAUFI/002-9663457-4851248   
According to the author, the author is a follower of Sri Ramana Maharshi and  
became enlightened in early 2004. The methods described in his book are indeed  
very attractive. But I feel he is trying hard to promote his book: creating a  
bunch of not-quite-useful Amazon.com Listmania! Lists and putting his book as  
the first one in the lists, "boasting" his methods being superior than other  
sages' including Maharshi and so on. I don't mean to offend or attack someone  
who really is a realized person or a real sage. But I just don't feel quite  
comfortable to see such commercial-like acts happening. At least, I believe  
Sri Ramana Maharshi would not do someting like these. Any information about  
this author are welcome!

Is this the same Micheal Langford who wrote the photography books?   
I checked out the link, and there seems to be nothing new in anything he is  
saying, but not having read more than the excerpt, I would not try to pass any  
sort of judgment on it. Still, when people talk of experiencing complete  
enlightenment, one should take it with a grain of salt.   
Also, a thing to consider: Anyone with even a very partial awakening, one of  
the most noticeable things about them will be the warmth and intimacy they  
convey in everything they say and do.

May be the instructions by the author are correct. However it is the vasanas  
who determine whether they work or not. If Michael really lost his body mind  
identification early 2004, awareness will not let him claim enlightenment.   
So many times the deathexperience similar to Bhagavan's happened to me. I  
tried to respond like He did but fear always takes over and the whole thing  
ends up as a bad trip. This means vasanas are still active. It is all not in  
our hands

I suggest you inquire, "Who is touched so deeply by this book?   
Some 5-6 years ago, when I read books by Papaji, Balsekar and teachers like  
them, I was touched so deeply. Everything became clear. I felt free. I felt  
unburdened. Till I realized it was all Ego that was so touched. Ego had become  
the knower!   
Ego told me, take a seat and rest! You are already what you looking for. In  
other words, "abide in Ego".   
Have a good Day BB

That is so great that you found freedom from reading some books!

Hiya blissboy   
I think that experience of spaciousness might be a positive move upwards  
[metaphor].   
If everything is the Self, the whole percieved world is a picture within us, a  
picture made by the mind out of sense impressions, then this sense of  
spaciuosness could be an the begining of an awareness of the Self.   
The Self is the Universe, is All of everything.All that we ever experience is  
the Self. Vast, eternal, all pervading. really all we experience is the Self.   
 I went upstairs and got the book "Ramana mahrishi and the path of Self  
Knowledge" I opened it more or less randomly and here is where it opened!!!  
This is what it says!!!   
Page 99 i   
instructions to FH Humpries.   
 H. Master can I help the world?   
Bh.Help yourself and you will help the world.   
H. I wish to help the world. Shall I not be helpful?   
Bh. Yes Helping yourself you help the world.You are in the world, you are the  
world.You are not different from the world,nor is the world different from  
you.   
H. [aftre a pause] Master can I perform miiracals as Sri Krisna and Jesus did  
before ?   
Bh. Did any of them, when he performed them,feel it was he who was performing  
them?   
H. No Master.   
 Ramana says YOU ARE THE WORLD!   
Elsewhere he says the Self is the screen upon which the picture of the world  
is projected!   
He says that the seer of the world, the Aham Vritti [ego] is also on the  
screen.   
So maybe your experience of spaciousness is the beginning of an expansiion of  
consciousness   
Peace

Somebody asked Swami Dayanand....how can you define truth... bcos if truth is  
going to defined then it will be thru words which are limited. ....words are  
limited. .understanding is limited..   
Any definition will have a negation, an opposite view point...   
Dayanandaji said..."something which cannot be negated is truth"....   
Mohan   
Captmj, ask Swami Dayanand whether he he thinks there exists a concept in this  
creation that cannot be negated.   
As far as I know any concept can be broken by a person who act from awareness.

Recently I came across a book called "The Most Rapid and Direct Method To  
Eternal Bliss" by Michael  
Langford:http://astore.amazon.com/powerfulspiri-20/detail/B000KMAUFI/002-9663457-4851248   
According to the author, the author is a follower of Sri Ramana Maharshi and  
became enlightened in early 2004. The methods described in his book are indeed  
very attractive. But I feel he is trying hard to promote his book: creating a  
bunch of not-quite-useful Amazon.com Listmania! Lists and putting his book as  
the first one in the lists, "boasting" his methods being superior than other  
sages' including Maharshi and so on. I don't mean to offend or attack someone  
who really is a realized person or a real sage. But I just don't feel quite  
comfortable to see such commercial-like acts happening. At least, I believe  
Sri Ramana Maharshi would not do someting like these. Any information about  
this author are welcome!

Hello Michael...   
Just one question...does a enlightened person say that he/ she is  
enlightened...shud a enlightened person say I am enlightened..   
are we so gullible...

Is this the same Micheal Langford who wrote the photography books?   
I checked out the link, and there seems to be nothing new in anything he is  
saying, but not having read more than the excerpt, I would not try to pass any  
sort of judgment on it. Still, when people talk of experiencing complete  
enlightenment, one should take it with a grain of salt.   
Also, a thing to consider: Anyone with even a very partial awakening, one of  
the most noticeable things about them will be the warmth and intimacy they  
convey in everything they say and do.

Michael Langford is the real thing but I invite you to verify this for  
yourself. Over the past decade he has devoted thousands of hours to helping  
people in online discussion groups focused on Ramana Maharshi, which is how I  
found out about him. He is not commercializing his material, as everything he  
has written is available freely on the web. He regards Ramana Maharshi as his  
guru and has done a tremendous service by pointing out a way to practice that  
is abundantly documented in the works of Ramana, illustrated further by  
Muruganar, Sadhu Om and Annamalami Swami, but which is missed by many  
commentators. An index to Michael Langford's writings can be found on a page  
titled Awareness Watching Awareness at this address: http://www.albigen.com/uarelove/   
Best wishes to all.

May be the instructions by the author are correct. However it is the vasanas  
who determine whether they work or not. If Michael really lost his body mind  
identification early 2004, awareness will not let him claim enlightenment.   
So many times the deathexperience similar to Bhagavan's happened to me. I  
tried to respond like He did but fear always takes over and the whole thing  
ends up as a bad trip. This means vasanas are still active. It is all not in  
our hands

Do not take these statement like "Ramana is my guru" for granted. Such  
statements have as much value as people to whom Jesus is the real thing or  
Muhammed is the real thing. Michael just made a projection of Ramana and is  
thus guided by his own creation. Probably this Ramana told him he is  
enlightened.

Mohan   
Captmj, ask Swami Dayanand whether he he thinks there exists a concept in this  
creation that cannot be negated.   
As far as I know any concept can be broken by a person who act from awareness.

Dear non duel, Yes. In our path to self-enquiry, doubts will   
arise, and we have to seek the help of others to solve them or   
find the answers. The work in progress will then get a formation   
of finished product, that is the Self. There is a book called   
Work in Progress or Finnegans Wake, by James Joyce. That   
book has not been completed, and people say that no one in   
the world has ever completed reading the book! James Joyce,   
wrote three novels in his life. The first is: The Portarait of an   
Artist as a Young Man. The second is: Ulysses. The third one is: Work in Progress or Finnegans Wake. In the whole world, there   
is only one prose book (!) for which a key was written, (as they   
would write for Sakespeare), and that is Ulysses.   
Arunachala Siva.

See the warning about him and his book and the "Awareness watching Awareness"  
method in http://www.gurusfeet.com/blog/warning-about-quot-awareness-watching-  
awareness-quot   
I quote from there: "It is an erroneous distorted interpretation of Ramana Maharshi and  
Nisargadatta Maharaj in general and of the Self Inquiry in particular."   
"But worse of all, it assumes that the Self or as it termed there "background  
awareness" can be watched as an object while it is fundamental that anything  
that can be watched as an object cannot be the ultimate subject, the self, but  
is just another face of the "I" thought. Regarding the self, you can only  
abide in it, not watch it, i.e. peel off the onion to remain naked as the  
self."

Dear riktam,   
Yes. There are many like Langford, who have written incorrect   
things about Bhagavan Ramana and Self Enquiry. They not only   
understand Bhagavan Ramana incorrectly, but also write out their   
own " rotten theories " about Him. One should be careful in   
reading such books. One another gentleman (see David Godman's   
blog, old posts, in www.davidgodman.org) said that since Bhagavan   
Ramana had no formal learning of scriptures, He must not have   
self realized! What to say?   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear amiatall,   
Many like Langford, Echart Tolle have written about self   
enquiry and enlightenment, in their own words, and this   
is their understanding. Bhagavan Ramana is like an Elephant.   
Many blind people are describing the elephant, and saying   
that it is like a pillar, it is like a large fan, it is like a rock,   
etc., A few only [eg. David Godman, Robert Butler, Michael   
James] have understood Bhagavan Ramana correctly and   
their understanding is in tune with the old stalwars who   
had spent decades [eg. Muruganar, WHO, Yogi Ramaiah,   
Munagala Venkatramaiah] with Bhagavan Ramana and have   
writeen or spoke about Him. Only people who have landed   
on the moon can describe the nature of the moon and not   
who see it through NASA telescopes.

Dear riktam,   
I agree with you.   
I am sad to see that some people distort Bhagavan's teaching like this.   
Langford confuses 'awareness' with 'mind'.   
His method 'awareness watching awareness' is, in fact, nothing but 'mind  
watching void', which leads you nowhere.   
Riktam, I understand you are not here in this forum anymore, seeing you have  
only one post, but I want to say I am happy to see your post.

To my mind what he means by awareness watching awareness is abiding in self.  
It is not like watching an object but it is different word for just being.  
That's exactly what I think, @amiatall. ''Awareness watching awareness'' is a  
very powerful method. Unfortunately, most of the people don't try it.  
Nisargadatta Maharaj talks about it in ''I Am That'':  _Q: You use the words 'aware' and 'conscious'. Are they not the same?   
M: Awareness is primordial; it is the original state, beginningless, endless,  
uncaused, unsupported, without parts, without change. Consciousness is on  
contact, a reflection against a surface, a state of duality. There can be no  
consciousness without awareness, but there can be awareness without  
consciousness, as in deep sleep. Awareness is absolute, consciousness is  
relative to its content; consciousness is always of something. Consciousness  
is partial and changeful, awareness is total, changeless, calm and silent. And  
it is the common matrix of every experience.   
Q: How does one go beyond consciousness into awareness?   
M: Since it is awareness that makes consciousness possible, there is awareness  
in every state of consciousness. Therefore **the very consciousness of being  
conscious is already a movement in awareness**. Interest in your stream of  
consciousness takes you to awareness. It is not a new state. It is at once  
recognised as the original, basic existence, which is life itself, and also  
love and joy.   
M: The mind must learn that beyond the moving mind there is the background of  
awareness, which does not change. The mind must come to know the true self and  
respect it and cease covering it up, like the moon which obscures the sun  
during solar eclipse. Just realise that nothing observable, or experienceable  
is you, or binds you. Take no notice of what is not yourself.   
Q: To do what you tell me I must be ceaselessly aware.   
M: To be aware is to be awake. Unaware means asleep. You are aware anyhow, you  
need not try to be. **What you need is to be aware of being aware**. Be aware  
deliberately and consciously, broaden and deepen the field of awareness. You  
are always conscious of the mind, but you are not aware of yourself as being  
conscious._

Quote from: amiatall on November 11, 2009, 11:22:03 AM  
He quotes a lot from Guru Vachaka Kovai where Murugnar writes exactly about  
Self-awareness and how it is important.   
I''ll give some examples for the people who don't know Sri Muruganar's book: ''432\. Is it not because you are knowledge [i.e. consciousness] itelf that  
you are able to know the world? If[instead of knowing the world] **you turn  
your attention, taking that Consciousness alone as your target,**   
It will Itself as the Guru reveal the Truth [i.e. Reality]. (page 119)   
638\. If, instead of seeing anything in front [of you] by the mind, **you see  
by the mind the one who sees**, all will be found to be oneself, the seer;  
then all objective knowledges will be found to be foolish. (page 181)   
647\. Do not look at this, do not look at that. If you simply remain without  
looking at anything, **then by that powerful look at [ones own] being [that  
is, by that powerful attention to Self, I am]**, you will become the   
supreme reality which has the outlook of the unlimited space of consciousness  
[chit-akasa]. (page 185)''   
The quotes are from GURU VACHAKA KOVAI, translated from the original Tamil by  
Sadhu Om and Michael James.

I am interested in the "albigen.com" site that has been mentioned.   
It seems like the author is very intent on providing clarity to the seeker,  
and this is why he is providing a number of different descriptions of a  
practice. From his history he feels that lack of clarity of the instructions  
caused much delay.   
It is good to have clarity, for something that is hard to explain.   
Some queries have been raised about whether the techniques at "albigen.com"  
are the same as Maharshi's or will lead in the same direction. It doesn't  
seem that way to me as it seems like when you are practicing you are guided to  
the direction.   
In any case there is far too much difficulty in finding the instructions to  
Life and I am happy that someone has them so clearly stated. I mean if the  
Bible really boils down to "I AM" then it would have taken me quite a few  
lifetimes to work it out.   
It would be good if all humans were directed to a page of simple instructions  
called "The Instructions to Life". No more long books !

Dear rideover,   
The simplest book as far as I know, is Who am I? by Bhagavan   
Ramana. No quotes from outside. All His experience. This was   
WRITTEN and given to Sivaprakasam Pillai and hence no different   
versions, no dilutions due to lapse of time. I read this book   
everyday and it gives me the unadulterated guidance that has   
helped me a lot.

Dear Chuck Cliff,   
Yes. It was writtten by Bhagavan Ramana to Sivaprakasam Pillai.   
In respect of ancient scriptures in Hindu theology, there were only   
spoken words. Vedas and Upanishads and Gita were also spoken   
These gave rise to various rescensions in later centuries. But   
Who am I? was different. Take for example, the Bhagavad Gita.   
It was taught among the battle noise. Arjuna would himself found   
it difficult to listen to it carefully. Then came the various rescensions   
and there could be many errors of commission and omission. Who   
am I? that way is blemishless.   
The Bible was written,for example in Hebrew. Then came the King   
James Version and then the New English Version. In translations,   
many times the original meaning and purport is lost. Is it not?   
Arunachala Siva.

deliberately and consciously, broaden and deepen the field of awareness. You  
are always conscious of the mind, but you are not aware of yourself as being

Quote from: amiatall on November 11, 2009, 11:22:03 AM  
He quotes a lot from Guru Vachaka Kovai where Murugnar writes exactly about  
Self-awareness and how it is important.   
I''ll give some examples for the people who don't know Sri Muruganar's book: ''432\. Is it not because you are knowledge [i.e. consciousness] itelf that  
you are able to know the world? If[instead of knowing the world] **you turn  
your attention, taking that Consciousness alone as your target,**   
It will Itself as the Guru reveal the Truth [i.e. Reality]. (page 119)   
638\. If, instead of seeing anything in front [of you] by the mind, **you see  
by the mind the one who sees**, all will be found to be oneself, the seer;  
then all objective knowledges will be found to be foolish. (page 181)   
647\. Do not look at this, do not look at that. If you simply remain without  
looking at anything, **then by that powerful look at [ones own] being [that  
is, by that powerful attention to Self, I am]**, you will become the   
supreme reality which has the outlook of the unlimited space of consciousness  
[chit-akasa]. (page 185)''   
The quotes are from GURU VACHAKA KOVAI, translated from the original Tamil by  
Sadhu Om and Michael James.

I am interested in the "albigen.com" site that has been mentioned.   
It seems like the author is very intent on providing clarity to the seeker,  
and this is why he is providing a number of different descriptions of a  
practice. From his history he feels that lack of clarity of the instructions  
caused much delay.   
It is good to have clarity, for something that is hard to explain.   
Some queries have been raised about whether the techniques at "albigen.com"  
are the same as Maharshi's or will lead in the same direction. It doesn't  
seem that way to me as it seems like when you are practicing you are guided to  
the direction.   
In any case there is far too much difficulty in finding the instructions to  
Life and I am happy that someone has them so clearly stated. I mean if the  
Bible really boils down to "I AM" then it would have taken me quite a few  
lifetimes to work it out.   
It would be good if all humans were directed to a page of simple instructions  
called "The Instructions to Life". No more long books !

Dear rideover,   
The simplest book as far as I know, is Who am I? by Bhagavan   
Ramana. No quotes from outside. All His experience. This was   
WRITTEN and given to Sivaprakasam Pillai and hence no different   
versions, no dilutions due to lapse of time. I read this book   
everyday and it gives me the unadulterated guidance that has   
helped me a lot.   
Arunachala Siva.

Quote  
This was WRITTEN  
 \-- and the first answer was WRITTEN in the SAND: The nature of knowledge is  
sat-chit-ananda [being-consciousness-bliss].   
Pillai copied it to his note book and added some explanatory comment. Ramana  
later approved Pillai's additions if the original answer was printed in bold.   
What's important for me is that the answer was **_written the sand_** \-- that  
just blows my mind out of the water!

Dear Chuck Cliff,   
Yes. It was writtten by Bhagavan Ramana to Sivaprakasam Pillai.   
In respect of ancient scriptures in Hindu theology, there were only   
spoken words. Vedas and Upanishads and Gita were also spoken   
These gave rise to various rescensions in later centuries. But   
Who am I? was different. Take for example, the Bhagavad Gita.   
It was taught among the battle noise. Arjuna would himself found   
it difficult to listen to it carefully. Then came the various rescensions   
and there could be many errors of commission and omission. Who   
am I? that way is blemishless.   
The Bible was written,for example in Hebrew. Then came the King   
James Version and then the New English Version. In translations,   
many times the original meaning and purport is lost. Is it not?   
Arunachala Siva.

Well, if people are afraid of trying ''the awareness watching awareness''  
method -I don't blame them: the world is full of false masters-, Ramana's  
Self-enquiry method is good enough because it leads to Self-awareness, through  
the agency of Self-attention. Sri Sadhu Om explains excellently Ramana's Self-  
enquiry in his book, ''The Path of Sri Ramana'': http://www.notthisnotthat.com/resources/The_Path_of_Sri_Ramana_Part_One.pdf   
I will give some quotes from his book (pages 137-138): ''Just as the correct meaning of the term meditation upon Brahman  
(brahmadhyanam) used by the sastras up till now is explained by Sri Bhagavan  
in the last two lines of the first benedictory verse of Ulladhu Narpadhu to  
be abiding in the Heart as it is (that is to say, abiding as Self is the  
correct way of meditating upon it), so also, the correct meaning of the term  
Self-enquiry (atma-vichara) is here rightly explained to be turning  
Selfwards (or attending to Self).''   
''In either of these two kinds of enquiry (Who am I? or Whence am I ?),  
since the attention of the aspirant is focused only on himself, nothing other  
than Self (atman), which is the true import of the word I, will be finally  
experienced.''   
''Therefore, whether done in the form Whence am I? or Who am I ?, what is  
absolutely essential is that Self-attention should be pursued till the very  
end.''   
P.S. Sri Sadhu Om Swamigal tirelessly practised Self-Enquiry in a remote house  
'Sri Arunachala Ramana Nilayam' in the interior of Thiruvannamalai for 30-odd  
years, and scrupulously wrote down the difficulties faced by him in Self-  
Enquiry and also the methods by which he overcame them.

Recently I came across a book called "The Most Rapid and Direct Method To  
Eternal Bliss" by Michael Langford: According to the author, the author is a follower of Sri Ramana Maharshi and  
became enlightened in early 2004. The methods described in his book are indeed  
very attractive. But I feel he is trying hard to promote his book: creating a  
bunch of not-quite-useful Amazon.com Listmania! Lists and putting his book as  
the first one in the lists, "boasting" his methods being superior than other  
sages' including Maharshi and so on. I don't mean to offend or attack someone  
who really is a realized person or a real sage. But I just don't feel quite  
comfortable to see such commercial-like acts happening. At least, I believe  
Sri Ramana Maharshi would not do someting like these. Any information about  
this author are welcome!

Is this the same Micheal Langford who wrote the photography books?   
I checked out the link, and there seems to be nothing new in anything he is  
saying, but not having read more than the excerpt, I would not try to pass any  
sort of judgment on it. Still, when people talk of experiencing complete  
enlightenment, one should take it with a grain of salt.   
Also, a thing to consider: Anyone with even a very partial awakening, one of  
the most noticeable things about them will be the warmth and intimacy they  
convey in everything they say and do.

Michael Langford is the real thing but I invite you to verify this for  
yourself. Over the past decade he has devoted thousands of hours to helping  
people in online discussion groups focused on Ramana Maharshi, which is how I  
found out about him. He is not commercializing his material, as everything he  
has written is available freely on the web. He regards Ramana Maharshi as his  
guru and has done a tremendous service by pointing out a way to practice that  
is abundantly documented in the works of Ramana, illustrated further by  
Muruganar, Sadhu Om and Annamalami Swami, but which is missed by many  
commentators. An index to Michael Langford's writings can be found on a page  
titled Awareness Watching Awareness at this address: http://www.albigen.com/uarelove/   
Best wishes to all.

Recently I came across a book called "The Most Rapid and Direct Method To  
Eternal Bliss" by Michael Langford: According to the author, the author is a follower of Sri Ramana Maharshi and  
became enlightened in early 2004. The methods described in his book are indeed  
very attractive. But I feel he is trying hard to promote his book: creating a  
bunch of not-quite-useful Amazon.com Listmania! Lists and putting his book as  
the first one in the lists, "boasting" his methods being superior than other  
sages' including Maharshi and so on. I don't mean to offend or attack someone  
who really is a realized person or a real sage. But I just don't feel quite  
comfortable to see such commercial-like acts happening. At least, I believe  
Sri Ramana Maharshi would not do someting like these. Any information about  
this author are welcome!   
Have you even read the book? He never says "his methods" are anything other  
than what Maharshi and others have taught. I never saw a hint of him claiming  
any method to be his own.   
Regards,   
Mike

May be the instructions by the author are correct. However it is the vasanas  
who determine whether they work or not. If Michael really lost his body mind  
identification early 2004, awareness will not let him claim enlightenment.   
So many times the deathexperience similar to Bhagavan's happened to me. I  
tried to respond like He did but fear always takes over and the whole thing  
ends up as a bad trip. This means vasanas are still active. It is all not in  
our hands

Michael Langford is the real thing but I invite you to verify this for  
yourself. Over the past decade he has devoted thousands of hours to helping  
people in online discussion groups focused on Ramana Maharshi, which is how I  
found out about him. He is not commercializing his material, as everything he  
has written is available freely on the web. He regards Ramana Maharshi as his  
guru and has done a tremendous service by pointing out a way to practice that  
is abundantly documented in the works of Ramana, illustrated further by  
Muruganar, Sadhu Om and Annamalami Swami, but which is missed by many  
commentators. An index to Michael Langford's writings can be found on a page  
titled Awareness Watching Awareness at this address: http://www.albigen.com/uarelove/   
Best wishes to all.   
Do not take these statement like "Ramana is my guru" for granted. Such  
statements have as much value as people to whom Jesus is the real thing or  
Muhammed is the real thing. Michael just made a projection of Ramana and is  
thus guided by his own creation. Probably this Ramana told him he is  
enlightened.

Bravo. ..Yam   
Somebody asked Swami Dayanand....how can you define truth... bcos if truth is  
going to defined then it will be thru words which are limited. ....words are  
limited. .understanding is limited..   
Any definition will have a negation, an opposite view point...   
Dayanandaji said..."something which cannot be negated is truth"....

I suggest you inquire, "Who is touched so deeply by this book?   
Some 5-6 years ago, when I read books by Papaji, Balsekar and teachers like  
them, I was touched so deeply. Everything became clear. I felt free. I felt  
unburdened. Till I realized it was all Ego that was so touched. Ego had become  
the knower!   
Ego told me, take a seat and rest! You are already what you looking for. In  
other words, "abide in Ego".   
Have a good Day BB

"I suggest you inquire, "Who is touched so deeply by this book?"   
Good question-   
When I ask that question, there is just an experience of spaciousness.   
That is so great that you found freedom from reading some books!

Hiya blissboy   
I think that experience of spaciousness might be a positive move upwards  
[metaphor].   
If everything is the Self, the whole percieved world is a picture within us, a  
picture made by the mind out of sense impressions, then this sense of  
spaciuosness could be an the begining of an awareness of the Self.   
The Self is the Universe, is All of everything.All that we ever experience is  
the Self. Vast, eternal, all pervading. really all we experience is the Self.   
 I went upstairs and got the book "Ramana mahrishi and the path of Self  
Knowledge" I opened it more or less randomly and here is where it opened!!!  
This is what it says!!!   
Page 99 i   
instructions to FH Humpries.   
 H. Master can I help the world?   
Bh.Help yourself and you will help the world.   
H. I wish to help the world. Shall I not be helpful?   
Bh. Yes Helping yourself you help the world.You are in the world, you are the  
world.You are not different from the world,nor is the world different from  
you.   
H. [aftre a pause] Master can I perform miiracals as Sri Krisna and Jesus did  
before ?   
Bh. Did any of them, when he performed them,feel it was he who was performing  
them?   
H. No Master.   
 Ramana says YOU ARE THE WORLD!   
Elsewhere he says the Self is the screen upon which the picture of the world  
is projected!   
He says that the seer of the world, the Aham Vritti [ego] is also on the  
screen.   
So maybe your experience of spaciousness is the beginning of an expansiion of  
consciousness   
Peace

As far as I know any concept can be broken by a person who act from awareness.

Dear non duel, Yes. In our path to self-enquiry, doubts will   
arise, and we have to seek the help of others to solve them or   
find the answers. The work in progress will then get a formation   
of finished product, that is the Self. There is a book called   
Work in Progress or Finnegans Wake, by James Joyce. That   
book has not been completed, and people say that no one in   
the world has ever completed reading the book! James Joyce,   
wrote three novels in his life. The first is: The Portarait of an   
Artist as a Young Man. The second is: Ulysses. The third one is: Work in Progress or Finnegans Wake. In the whole world, there   
is only one prose book (!) for which a key was written, (as they   
would write for Sakespeare), and that is Ulysses.

See the warning about him and his book and the "Awareness watching Awareness"  
method in http://www.gurusfeet.com/blog/warning-about-quot-awareness-watching-  
awareness-quot   
I quote from there: "It is an erroneous distorted interpretation of Ramana Maharshi and  
Nisargadatta Maharaj in general and of the Self Inquiry in particular."   
"But worse of all, it assumes that the Self or as it termed there "background  
awareness" can be watched as an object while it is fundamental that anything  
that can be watched as an object cannot be the ultimate subject, the self, but  
is just another face of the "I" thought. Regarding the self, you can only  
abide in it, not watch it, i.e. peel off the onion to remain naked as the  
self."

Dear riktam,   
Yes. There are many like Langford, who have written incorrect   
things about Bhagavan Ramana and Self Enquiry. They not only   
understand Bhagavan Ramana incorrectly, but also write out their   
own " rotten theories " about Him. One should be careful in   
reading such books. One another gentleman (see David Godman's   
blog, old posts, in www.davidgodman.org) said that since Bhagavan   
Ramana had no formal learning of scriptures, He must not have   
self realized! What to say?

Dear amiatall,   
Many like Langford, Echart Tolle have written about self   
enquiry and enlightenment, in their own words, and this   
is their understanding. Bhagavan Ramana is like an Elephant.   
Many blind people are describing the elephant, and saying   
that it is like a pillar, it is like a large fan, it is like a rock,   
etc., A few only [eg. David Godman, Robert Butler, Michael   
James] have understood Bhagavan Ramana correctly and   
their understanding is in tune with the old stalwars who   
had spent decades [eg. Muruganar, WHO, Yogi Ramaiah,   
Munagala Venkatramaiah] with Bhagavan Ramana and have   
writeen or spoke about Him. Only people who have landed   
on the moon can describe the nature of the moon and not   
who see it through NASA telescopes.

Dear riktam,   
I agree with you.   
I am sad to see that some people distort Bhagavan's teaching like this.   
Langford confuses 'awareness' with 'mind'.   
His method 'awareness watching awareness' is, in fact, nothing but 'mind  
watching void', which leads you nowhere.   
Riktam, I understand you are not here in this forum anymore, seeing you have  
only one post, but I want to say I am happy to see your post.

To my mind what he means by awareness watching awareness is abiding in self.  
It is not like watching an object but it is different word for just being.  
That's exactly what I think, @amiatall. ''Awareness watching awareness'' is a  
very powerful method. Unfortunately, most of the people don't try it.  
Nisargadatta Maharaj talks about it in ''I Am That'':  _Q: You use the words 'aware' and 'conscious'. Are they not the same?   
M: Awareness is primordial; it is the original state, beginningless, endless,  
uncaused, unsupported, without parts, without change. Consciousness is on  
contact, a reflection against a surface, a state of duality. There can be no  
consciousness without awareness, but there can be awareness without  
consciousness, as in deep sleep. Awareness is absolute, consciousness is  
relative to its content; consciousness is always of something. Consciousness  
is partial and changeful, awareness is total, changeless, calm and silent. And  
it is the common matrix of every experience.   
Q: How does one go beyond consciousness into awareness?   
M: Since it is awareness that makes consciousness possible, there is awareness  
in every state of consciousness. Therefore **the very consciousness of being  
conscious is already a movement in awareness**. Interest in your stream of  
consciousness takes you to awareness. It is not a new state. It is at once  
recognised as the original, basic existence, which is life itself, and also  
love and joy.   
M: The mind must learn that beyond the moving mind there is the background of  
awareness, which does not change. The mind must come to know the true self and  
respect it and cease covering it up, like the moon which obscures the sun  
during solar eclipse. Just realise that nothing observable, or experienceable  
is you, or binds you. Take no notice of what is not yourself.   
Q: To do what you tell me I must be ceaselessly aware.   
M: To be aware is to be awake. Unaware means asleep. You are aware anyhow, you  
need not try to be. **What you need is to be aware of being aware**. Be aware  
deliberately and consciously, broaden and deepen the field of awareness. You  
are always conscious of the mind, but you are not aware of yourself as being  
conscious._

Quote from: amiatall on November 11, 2009, 11:22:03 AM  
He quotes a lot from Guru Vachaka Kovai where Murugnar writes exactly about  
Self-awareness and how it is important.   
I''ll give some examples for the people who don't know Sri Muruganar's book: ''432\. Is it not because you are knowledge [i.e. consciousness] itelf that  
you are able to know the world? If[instead of knowing the world] **you turn  
your attention, taking that Consciousness alone as your target,**   
It will Itself as the Guru reveal the Truth [i.e. Reality]. (page 119)   
638\. If, instead of seeing anything in front [of you] by the mind, **you see  
by the mind the one who sees**, all will be found to be oneself, the seer;  
then all objective knowledges will be found to be foolish. (page 181)   
647\. Do not look at this, do not look at that. If you simply remain without  
looking at anything, **then by that powerful look at [ones own] being [that  
is, by that powerful attention to Self, I am]**, you will become the   
supreme reality which has the outlook of the unlimited space of consciousness  
[chit-akasa]. (page 185)''   
The quotes are from GURU VACHAKA KOVAI, translated from the original Tamil by

I am interested in the "albigen.com" site that has been mentioned.   
It seems like the author is very intent on providing clarity to the seeker,  
and this is why he is providing a number of different descriptions of a  
practice. From his history he feels that lack of clarity of the instructions  
caused much delay.   
It is good to have clarity, for something that is hard to explain.   
Some queries have been raised about whether the techniques at "albigen.com"  
are the same as Maharshi's or will lead in the same direction. It doesn't  
seem that way to me as it seems like when you are practicing you are guided to  
the direction.   
In any case there is far too much difficulty in finding the instructions to  
Life and I am happy that someone has them so clearly stated. I mean if the  
Bible really boils down to "I AM" then it would have taken me quite a few  
lifetimes to work it out.   
It would be good if all humans were directed to a page of simple instructions  
called "The Instructions to Life". No more long books !

Dear rideover,   
The simplest book as far as I know, is Who am I? by Bhagavan   
Ramana. No quotes from outside. All His experience. This was   
WRITTEN and given to Sivaprakasam Pillai and hence no different   
versions, no dilutions due to lapse of time. I read this book   
everyday and it gives me the unadulterated guidance that has   
helped me a lot.   
Arunachala Siva.

Quote  
This was WRITTEN  
 \-- and the first answer was WRITTEN in the SAND: The nature of knowledge is  
sat-chit-ananda [being-consciousness-bliss].   
Pillai copied it to his note book and added some explanatory comment. Ramana  
later approved Pillai's additions if the original answer was printed in bold.   
What's important for me is that the answer was **_written the sand_** \-- that  
just blows my mind out of the water!

Dear Chuck Cliff,   
Yes. It was writtten by Bhagavan Ramana to Sivaprakasam Pillai.   
In respect of ancient scriptures in Hindu theology, there were only   
spoken words. Vedas and Upanishads and Gita were also spoken   
These gave rise to various rescensions in later centuries. But   
Who am I? was different. Take for example, the Bhagavad Gita.   
It was taught among the battle noise. Arjuna would himself found   
it difficult to listen to it carefully. Then came the various rescensions   
and there could be many errors of commission and omission. Who   
am I? that way is blemishless.   
The Bible was written,for example in Hebrew. Then came the King   
James Version and then the New English Version. In translations,   
many times the original meaning and purport is lost. Is it not?   
Arunachala Siva.

Well, if people are afraid of trying ''the awareness watching awareness''  
method -I don't blame them: the world is full of false masters-, Ramana's  
Self-enquiry method is good enough because it leads to Self-awareness, through  
the agency of Self-attention. Sri Sadhu Om explains excellently Ramana's Self-  
enquiry in his book, ''The Path of Sri Ramana'': http://www.notthisnotthat.com/resources/The_Path_of_Sri_Ramana_Part_One.pdf   
I will give some quotes from his book (pages 137-138): ''Just as the correct meaning of the term meditation upon Brahman  
(brahmadhyanam) used by the sastras up till now is explained by Sri Bhagavan  
in the last two lines of the first benedictory verse of Ulladhu Narpadhu to  
be abiding in the Heart as it is (that is to say, abiding as Self is the  
correct way of meditating upon it), so also, the correct meaning of the term  
Self-enquiry (atma-vichara) is here rightly explained to be turning  
Selfwards (or attending to Self).''   
''In either of these two kinds of enquiry (Who am I? or Whence am I ?),  
since the attention of the aspirant is focused only on himself, nothing other  
than Self (atman), which is the true import of the word I, will be finally  
experienced.''   
''Therefore, whether done in the form Whence am I? or Who am I ?, what is  
absolutely essential is that Self-attention should be pursued till the very  
end.''   
P.S. Sri Sadhu Om Swamigal tirelessly practised Self-Enquiry in a remote house  
'Sri Arunachala Ramana Nilayam' in the interior of Thiruvannamalai for 30-odd  
years, and scrupulously wrote down the difficulties faced by him in Self-  
Enquiry and also the methods by which he overcame them.

A few only [eg. David Godman, Robert Butler, Michael   
James] have understood Bhagavan Ramana correctly   
David Godman, in his blog, says that Michael Lnagford's method is correct.   
(I myself do not think his method is correct.)

I agree with you. Once in a while, I disagree with David also.
