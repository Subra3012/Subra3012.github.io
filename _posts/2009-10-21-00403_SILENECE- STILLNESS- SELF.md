## Swami Vivekananda's Satsangh  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 20, 2009, 08:26:48 AM

In America, Swami Vivekananda spoke like a lion. He used to   
begin his discourses: O Amrita Swarupis... the Forms of Nectar!   
The Americans who had always heard in churches the priests   
addrssing them as "O Sinners!" became highly elated. They used   
to dance during his Satsangh, even though no songs were sung   
but only words flowed from Swami's lips.   
Suddenly a few girls thought that this monk from India was   
hypnotizing them. One of the girls stood up and told Swami   
Vivekananda: "Swami, you are hypnotizing us!"   
Swami Vivekananda smiled and said: "See my child, there is   
no reason to hypnotize you. You are all already hypnotized.   
I am only de-hypnotizing you!"   
This hypnotizing is "thiyakkam" mentioned by Bhagavan Ramana   
in Verse 49 of Sri Arunachala Aksharamana malai. The de-hypnotizing is  
removal of this thiyakkam, delusion of Maya, to   
realize the Self.   
Thedathu UtRa nal tiru aruL aha thiyakkam   
Theerthu aruL Arunachala.   
 \- Verse 49 of SRI A.A.M.M.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Charvakars  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 20, 2009, 10:53:29 AM

Indian Vedic thought allowed room, for a variety of schools of thoughts and  
philsophies. There were agnostics, there were atheists too.   
One type of athiests were named Charvakars. These Charvakars   
were telling: Why bother about Brahman or Atman?. We have   
got a body, take care of it, eat well and be merry with drinks and   
women.   
WE have today also many Charvakars. They feel that we should   
be happy and die. Eat daily ghee-mixed rice with dhal and curries.   
Dress up well. Go behind women. Buy properties, lands etc.,   
Anyway banks are giving loans left and right. Take all loans.   
Do not pay. The Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee is there   
to write off all the loans. Hence there is no need to worry about   
repayment......   
Sri Sankara says that these Charvakars will start worrying about   
the body, when the first grey hair appears, when the first pain   
on the chest appears, when there is no sleep at night, when there   
is a neighbour who died of cardiac arrest in a few hours. When   
the eyes become dim and when the ears start hearing only half   
of the sounds.   
So this Charvaka philosophy is not eternal. Everyone is a   
Charvaka in the younger days. Many do not seek the Self like   
Sri Sankara or Bhagavan Ramana. They first think about God   
or the Self when their philosphy meets with the first signs of   
defeat.   
What are the roots that clutch,   
What branches grow out of this stony rubbish,   
Son of Man, for you know only a heap of broken images,   
Where sun beats, the dead trees give no shelter   
And cricket no relief!   
 \- T.S. Eliot, The Waste Land.   
Arunachala Siva.

## skanda Sashti  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 21, 2009, 12:39:51 PM

Skanda Sashti is celebrated after Dipavali, from the first day   
of the waxing moon for six days. These are more the days   
of solemnity, of fasting, of prayers to Skanda. Skanda was   
born from the third eye of Siva. There was no union of Siva   
and Paravati. He is the real Male Child! Skanda killed Surapadma and his two  
brothers on a Sashti day, the sixth day of waxing   
moon in Tula month. The war is mother of all wars, lasting for   
18 years. Skanda was just three years old, when he fought   
Surapadama and brothers.   
Surapadma did a lot of penance for boons from Siva. He is a   
terrific demon, and Ravana and Kumbakarna and Kamsa cannot   
show a candle to him! He took the boons to rule 1008 worlds   
for 108 Yugas, aeons! He was ruling from a place called Veera   
Mahendrapuram in the present Sri Lanka.   
As soon as he got the kingship, he imprisoned Vishnu, Brahma,   
Indra and other gods. Under him, Brahma was the priest for   
his demonic prayers everyday! Indra and Varuna went to the   
oceans to fetch choices fish. Vishnu was the main assistant.   
Surapadma and his two brothers were killed and they became   
the peacock and rooster for Skanda. Mother Parvati gave   
Skanda, the powerful Spear as a weapon.   
Skanda has got as many as 225 temples in India. But six   
temples were his main abodes. These are called 6 barracks   
for him. The number 6 is the number of Skanda.   
He has got 6 faces.   
He has got a 6 lettered mantra, Sa ra va na bha va.   
His main chakra, the meditational drawing has got 6 angles.   
Skandam is the epic of Vyasa that describes Skanda's sports.   
Like Siva, he had no birth and no death. He rose as the Sun   
rose and vanquished the demons and released the gods.   
The Sun never sets.   
A little more information about Skandam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Stilling of thought in waking state amounts to knowing the self.   
For stilling of thought self-enquiry is the best way.
