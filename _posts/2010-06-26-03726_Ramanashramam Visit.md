Dear Nagaraj,   
I had planned to be there in Sri Ramanasramam for 3 days on 19th   
to 20th June 2009. On the first morning, we reached there by about   
10 am. We rushed to Matrubhuteswara Temple first. We saw   
the Mother as Matrubhuteswara and we spent some time in seeing   
the exquisite Sri Dakshinamurty. While coming round, we found   
Sri Nataraja and Sri Sivakamasundari within a mountain of flowers,   
wonderful decoration. Sivakami in silk saree and rose garlands   
and Nataraja in silk dhoti. The flower decking was so immense   
that his damru and fire could not be seen. We were wondering what   
was the occasion? One gentleman said that it is one of the 6 annual special  
abhishekam done called Aani Tirumanjanam, as per   
the practice of Chidambaram Temple! The deities were so beautiful to look at.  
The abhisheakm had happened in the early morning   
with prasadam of sweet pongal etc., I looked at his kunchitapatam and forgot  
myself for some time. In the very young years my father   
and mother used to take me to Chidamabaram Temple for this special occasion.  
[we were living in Chidambaram for 2 years]. I   
was remembering that.   
Then, we came to Sri Ramaneswara Mahalingam. He was also decorated nicely  
after abhishekam and the people told me that there would be two abhisheakms on  
that day, the usual one being in the evening. I circumambulated the Samadhi  
twice and then   
sat silently before Him for some time. Meantime Kannan said that we had been  
allotted a room in Morvi Guest House, M-10. It was a cloudy day in T'malai  
and there were at least 4 peacocks dancing on the portals and the upper deck  
of the Temple. Sri Sankara says peacocks coo as ke, ki, and ka and these are  
bhija mantrams of Devi. Siva calls her with her bhija mantaras says Sri  
Sankara. The peacocks were cooing like that.   
We had our lunch at 11.30 am. The food was special with sweet pongal and  
other delicacies. We came back to the room. The power cut in T'malai was  
between 10 and 12 noon. So fans were running. The heat was quite tolerable.  
In the afternoon, before going back to the Asramam, I wanted to meet  
J.Jayaraman and he was happy and spent some time with me. He is the Chief  
Librarian   
of the Centenary Library. This time, he explained a few verses from Ozhivil  
Odukkam and said that a new book has come from Sri Ramana Bhakta Samajam and I  
can get it if I write to them. Then he also said something about the 12 Siva  
Canons, Tirumurais. He said while Jnana Sambandha spoke mainly about kama,  
Tiru Navukkarasar mainly about artha and Sundaramurty about dharma,  
Manikkavachagar speaks only about jaana. Manikkavachakagar is a Siva Advaiti.  
After all, what is the difference between Advaita and Saiva Siddhantam? The  
guru who is non dual consciousness, has to come down to the level of  
disciples, to raise from lowliness. Hence some dualism starts here. So Saiva  
Siddhantam speaks only about this dualism with disciples and otherwise it is  
pure Advaitam.   
In the afternoon, we spent sometime listening to the book reading. It was  
Maharshi's Gospel in Tamil and Talks in English. After tea, we sat for the  
evening abhishekam. It was grand and the maha arti took place around 6 pm.  
The evening parayana was, being Saturday, the songs of Sri Ramana Stuti  
Panchakam of Satyamanagalam Venkataramana Iyer. After food at 7.30 we  
returned to the room. It was drizzling and the climate was pleasant. At  
around 8 pm we had a call from Bangalore that my wife's sister was quite ill  
and she needed my wife's help. All our happiness evaporated. That night  
itself, it was decided to return to Bangalore next afternoon. The next  
morning we had darshan of Matrubhuteswara Lingam and Ramaneswara Lingam.  
While coming out, we met Brahmasri Nochur Venkataraman with his family. The  
cute little boy Sadasiva was as usual moving with everyone there. He has  
planned to speak on ULLadu Narapdu for 7 days from 3rd July 2010. We were  
keeping our fingers crossed. In the bookshop,   
I saw the book mentioned by J. Jayaraman, Ozhivil Odukkam and I bought it  
immediately. We also decided to go for a quick round in car the Hill. It was  
over in about 1 1/2 hrs. We returned for lunch   
and I was looking at the Hill and asked the Hill, why are you driving me away  
within 36 hours? He simply smiled. The lunch was quickly finished. There  
was a bhikshavandanam by me on that noon. Payasam and other delicacies were  
served. The crowd was quite   
less compared to Jayanti and Aradhana. We saw Lakshmi and told her that we  
cannot stay for your Aradhana on 23rd. I spent some time in the Old Hall for  
meditation. It was a peaceful meditation   
for about 20 minutes.   
We then bid good bye to the Hill and returned to Bangalore. My wife without  
wasting even a minute, rushed in the same car to her   
sister's place. Her sister is better now. Our plans to go for Nochur's   
satsangh at T'malai is still undecided.   
Arunachala Siva.

So wonderful to read the accounts of your visit to Sri Ramanashramam. Each  
time when you share your experiences of your visit to Sri Ramanashramam, it is  
as if I am there and I am seeing all that you have described about your  
experiences.   
How I wish I could attend the Satsangh of Nochur and what better place to  
attend than Ramanashramam itself? My time is not yet come, the worldly games  
are to continue till how long??   
Thank you for your recollections   
Salutations to Sri Ramana
