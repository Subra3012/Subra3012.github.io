Last March 2009, I visited Srirangam but i failed to know about any Maths in  
Srirangam, are visitors are allowed to meet any top pontiff and seek  
blessings.   
Thanks

Dear karthikeyan. M   
Sri Rangam has got a Sri Vaishnava Math, with the head   
called as Ahobila Math Jeer or Srimad Andavan Swamigal. I   
have not visited and I do not have any further information.   
Arunachala Siva.
