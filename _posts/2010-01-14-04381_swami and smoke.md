## Just a Second  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: January 14, 2010, 05:12:46 AM

Dear I,   
I got this e-mail some time back, enjoy: A man was walking through a forest pondering life. He walked, pondered,  
walked, and pondered. He felt very close to nature and even close to God. He  
felt so close to God that he felt if he spoke God would listen.   
So he asked, "God, are you listening?"   
And God replied, "Yes my son, I am here."   
The man stopped and pondered some more.   
He looked towards the sky and said, "God, what is a million years to you?"   
God replied, "Well my son, a second to me is like a million years to you."   
So the man continued to walk and to ponder... walk and ponder... Then he  
looked to the sky again and said, "God, what is a million dollars to you?"   
And God replied, "My son, my son...a penny to me is like a million dollars to  
you. It means almost nothing to me. It does not even have a value it is so  
little."   
The man looked down, pondered a bit and then looked up to the sky and said,  
"God, can I have a million dollars?"   
And God replied, "In a second."   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

## toys  
Author: silentgreen         Date: January 12, 2010, 04:47:03 AM  
---  
A father brought building block toys (triangles and squares) for his child to  
play.   
The blocks are as follows: Triangle:  I   
 I - I   
 I Am - Am I   
Who Am I - I Am Who   
Square: Who Am I   
Am I Am   
I Am Who   
The child used to play in various ways by placing the blocks side by side,  
putting one block above the other etc.   
After playing for a few months the child disappeared.

## Tiruppavai - 29  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 12, 2010, 01:42:03 PM  
---  
Today is the 29th song.   
O Krishna, please hear the reason for our coming to you in this   
early morning to praise your lotus feet. The light of cowherds'   
clan, it is not correct on your part to leave our kainkaryas (sevas).   
The reason for our coming, is not merely for obtaining your grace.   
Not only in this birth but for our future 49 births, we should only   
be ruled over by you. We should not think anyone else as our Lord.   
We should only serve you and you only. Please give us this boon.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Tiruppavai - 28  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 12, 2010, 01:46:52 PM  
---  
The 28th and 29th song of Tiruppavai are sung today itself, since   
this year Dhanur month has got only 29 days and the last song   
is sung tomorrow, the 13th Jan. 2010.   
This song is sung by both cowherds and cowherdesses.   
We shall go behind our cows and reach the grasslands and there   
we shall take food together in your company. How much of merits we must have  
done, to have you in our clan! O the blemishless   
Govinda, the the protector of the cows and the jivas, no one can   
sever our relationship with you. The unlettered we, have called you by  
several pet names like (thief, breaker of curd/butter pots etc.,), please do  
not be angry with us. O our Lord, please grace us.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Tiruppavai - 30  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 13, 2010, 06:13:52 AM  
---  
Since this year Dhanur month has only 29 days, (on a few years   
it happens), the songs 28 and 29 are sung on 28th day and the   
30th song is sung on 29th day of the month. This is concluding   
song and is a Pala-sruti, the one that tells about benefits of singing   
this work. Benedictory Verse.   
O Madhava, O Kesava, the One who churned the milky ocean for   
giving the nectar to the gods! AndaL, the daughter of Periyazhwar   
has sung these thirty songs describing how the gopikas approached   
Krishna and got His grace and prize. Those who chant this daily   
shall get the grace in full of Krishna, who has got mountain-like   
four shoulders, red-lotus like eyes, beautiful countenance and   
get the highest happiness and bliss.   
Normally, as per Sri Vaishnava sampradaya, all the 30 songs of   
Tiruppavai should be sung everyday and not only in Dhanur months. However,  
even if one reads one song (ie. song no. 29 In this early morning....) daily,  
it is said to be highly beneficial for obtaining   
Krishna's grace.   
Similarly, it is said about Song No. 10 of Tiruvembavai, Pathaalam ezhinum  
keezh sorkazhivu paatha malar......   
Arunachala Siva.

## A bricklayer's tale  
Author: Graham              Date: January 14, 2010, 04:07:29 AM  
---  
I am a little disappointed at the posts in this section so far. There is  
nothing like a good old belly laugh to release tension and set the world to  
right.   
So here is something to get you going - an example of the British habit of  
understatement: Found at - http://www.btinternet.com/~knutty.knights/bricks.txt   
 _This is a bricklayer 's accident report that was printed in the newsletter  
of the English equivalent of the Workers' Compensation Board. So here, thanks  
to John Sedgwick is this Bricklayer's report._   
\   
Dear Sir: I am writing in response to your request for additional information in Block  
#3 of the accident reporting form. I put "Poor Planning" as the cause of my  
accident. You asked for a fuller explanation and I trust the following  
details will be sufficient.   
I am a bricklayer by trade. On the day of the accident, I was working alone  
on the roof of a new six-storey building. When I completed my work, I found I  
had some bricks left over which when weighed later were found to weigh 240  
lbs. Rather than carry the bricks down by hand, I decided to lower them in a  
barrel by using a pulley which was attached to the side of the building at the  
sixth floor.   
Securing the rope at ground level, I went up to the roof, swung the barrel out  
and loaded the bricks into it. Then I went down and untied the rope, holding  
it tightly to insure a slow descent of the 240 lbs of bricks. You will note  
on the accident reporting form that my weight is 135 lbs.   
Due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost my  
presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope. Needless to say, I  
proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building.   
In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel which was now proceeding  
downward at an equally impressive speed. This explains the fractured skull,  
minor abrasions and the broken collarbone, as listed in Section 3, accident  
reporting form.   
Slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the  
fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley which I  
mentioned in Paragraph 2 of this correspondence. Fortunately by this time I  
had regained my presence of mind and was able to hold tightly to the rope, in  
spite of the excruciating pain I was now beginning to experience.   
At approximately the same time, however, the barrel of bricks hit the ground-  
and the bottom fell out of the barrel. Now devoid of the weight of the bricks,  
the barrel weighed approximately 50 lbs.   
I refer you again to my weight. As you might imagine, I began a rapid descent  
down the side of the building.   
In the vicinity of the third floor, I met the barrel coming up. This accounts  
for the two fractured ankles, broken tooth and severe lacerations of my legs  
and lower body.   
Here my luck began to change slightly. The encounter with the barrel seemed  
to slow me enough to lessen my injuries when I fell into the pile of bricks  
and fortunately only three vertebrae were cracked.   
I am sorry to report, however, as I lay there on the pile of bricks, in pain,  
unable to move and watching the empty barrel six stories above me, I again  
lost my composure and presence of mind and let go of the rope....

This is very British. Quite different from Asian style.   
I think I understand it should be funny for British people, but it did not  
make me laugh.   
When I was in England, a Japanese man told a joke to Enlishmen.   
 Listening to the joke, I laughed. I thought it was funny.   
But no Englishmen around him laughed. They didn't get the joke. They did not  
think it was funny.   
Different culture, different humour.

Hi Akira,   
It is not the story, but the way it is told that is at the root of British  
humour.   
Clearly the incident itself was horrific, but the writer has deliberately  
composed it with typical British understatement to make it humourous. It is  
our habit to make our disasters and mistakes appear funny.

Dear SLakshmi,   
Yes. In the same way, I think, when a large volume of incense was   
burnt or when arti was shown, Bhagavan Ramana said: "Okay. Show   
these to to your heart's content. But why not to that Kallu Swami (the   
stone image, in front of Mother's Temple? It will not object." This   
was in 1946. It happened. Today we have only the Kallu Swami but   
not Bhagavan Ramana in body. His living Presence is however definitely   
there. The Asramam has seen to it that no arti is shown or no incense   
is burnt even before that stone image!   
Arunachala Siva.

Doopam normally refers to a small wick dipped in ghee and shown   
to God in the home altar before actual camphor lighting.   
Deepam is a regular lamp, with oil or ghee.   
Dasangam is the one which is called Sambrani, the powder which   
is burnt on a coal fire.   
The words, Dasangam and Doopam are of course interchangeably used.   
Arunachala Siva.
