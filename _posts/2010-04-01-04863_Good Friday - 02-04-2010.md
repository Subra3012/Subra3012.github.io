Tomorrow is Good Friday, when Jesus was crucified about 2000   
years back. The resurrection took place on the third day, Sunday,   
which is Easter.   
1 Peter 2, Verses 18-25:-   
18\. Servants, you must obey your masters, and always show respect   
to them. Do this, not only to those who are kind and thoughtful,   
but also to those who are cruel.   
19\. God will bless you, even if others treat you unfairly for being   
loyal to him.   
20\. You don't gain anything by being punished for some wrong you have done.  
But God will bless you, if you have to suffer for doing something good.   
21\. After all, God chose you to suffer as you follow in the footsteps of  
Christ, who set an example by suffering for you.   
22-25: Christ did not sin, or ever tell a lie.   
Although he as abused, he never tried to get even.   
And when he suffered, he made not threats.   
Instead, he had faith in God, who judges fairly.   
Christ carried the burden of our sins.   
He was nailed to the cross,   
 so that we would stop sinning and start living right.   
By his cus and bruises you are healed.   
You had wandered away like sheep.   
Now you have returned to the one,   
 who is your shepherd and protects.   
(Source: New Testament, Peter's First Letter.)

Subramanian Garu,   
As swami vivekananda says,   
 **Buddha and Christ are the two greatest "bubbles" the world has known.**  
They were great souls who having realised freedom helped others to escape.  
**Neither was perfect**, but they are to be judged by their virtues, never by  
their defects. **Jesus fell short, because he did not always live up to his  
own highest ideal; and above all, because he did not give woman an equal place  
with man.** Woman did everything for him, yet not one was made an apostle.  
This was doubtless owing to his Semitic origin. The great Aryans, Buddha among  
the rest, have always put woman in an equal position with man. For them sex in  
religion did not exist. **In the Vedas and Upanishads, women taught the  
highest truths and received the same veneration as men.**

Dear prasanth,   
As I had repeatedly said in this Forum, no Jnani can be compared with another  
Jnani. Each one, though self realized, has to act   
according to the laws and codes of the society in which they   
were living. The women did not have an equal position with   
women, during Christ's time about 2000 years back, in Israel.   
Hence he could not go against the society. As otherwise, Jesus called  
Magadalene and told her: "You are going to be the mother for   
all my brothers and disciples." Such a honour was given to   
Magadalene. Jesus said: Do not covet your neighbour's wife.   
But at the same time, when one gentleman had died and he had   
no issues, he told that man's younger brother to marry the widowed   
sister in law to give an offspring to take care of her. Not coveting   
neighbour's wife is the spiritual instruction- to control lust. But   
at the same time, the second instruction is to help the widowed   
sister in law to have an offspring through her husband's brother,   
for her livelihood. Otherwise, the society would keep her away, as   
a destitute. Or, she might have even become a harlot to earn her bread. Both  
are instructions, one is spiritual and the other is societal.   
In Buddha's case, though he treated women and men as equal,   
there were no direct disciples for him even in his times. He did   
not even permit his mother to become a monk and a disciple.   
Ananda, Buddha's youngest disciple, told him to permit Buddha's   
mother and wife to become monks. But these are as per the codes of the  
society. Further, a woman guru deviating from her path of ascetism would  
create more damage to the religion than a man guru.   
We have seen what happened to Nityananda. If the guru had been   
a lady, it would have created more furore.   
In India, there were rishis who were women. But they were all householders  
and not sannyasinis. Ascetism was not prescribed   
for them. Recently about 300 years back, Akka Mahadevi was   
an ascetic as well as a guru. She lived in Karnataka. Such cases   
are rare. Many a times, the gurus do not want to flout the codes   
of the society in which they were living.   
Bhagavan Ramana was above casteism. But He approved brahmins and non brahmins  
to sit in different rows with a wooden screen   
in between them, while lunching.   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian garu,   
All i meant to say was to tell Bhagavan Ramana is different from other  
gurus/Jnanis.but you are right that no comparision should be made but for me  
guru ramana is the ultimate and that is what i want to eloborate in my  
previous post.   
I think you had raised many points in the past in the forum describing the  
differences between guru ramana and many other gurus/jnanis.

 **There are women sannyasinis in our vedic times and i donot think not all  
are householders.**   
The first category of women mentioned in this Dharma sutra consists of the  
brahmavadinis  those girls who choose to devote their life to the study,  
practice and teaching of Vedic knowledge and the realization of Brahman. Such  
transcendental and powerful women were not required or expected to marry and  
raise children, although there was no rule that forbade them to do so.   
Among them, we can mention Visvavara, Ghosha, Sikata, Nivavari, Apala of the  
Atri family, Visvavara of the Atri family, Angirasi Sarasvati of the Angirasa  
family, Yami Vaivasvathi, Sraddha, Ghosha, Surya, Indrani, Urvasi, Sarama  
, Juhu and Poulomi Sachi, who are associated with Rig Veda mantras. Vac sukta  
(Rig Veda 10.125) dealing with revelation of Vedas is attributed to Rishika  
Vagambhrina. The Rig Veda suktas 10-134, 10-39,10-40, 10-91,  
10-95,10-107,10-109,10-154,10-159,10-189 etc are women; book 14 of Atharva  
veda and sections in several other books are attributed to Rishikas.

Dear prasanth,   
I thank you very much for these information from Rig Veda. Usually   
people quote only Gargi and Maitreyi. So I thought accordingly.   
I shall also look into Max Mueller's book on this.   
Regarding some of the old posts of mine that you have quoted that   
I was only trying to point out that Bhagavan Ramana was different   
and unique in respect of Jnanis. I did not compare Him with others   
on a scale. In fact, srkudai raised the same point during that time.   
I wanted to say that Bhagavan Ramana was a unique and different   
Brahmajnani.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear grhluna,   
Nice to hear about your meditation.   
An explosion from within. What a nice phenomenon.   
I remember J. Krishnamurthy (who always encouraged enquiry and was never  
usually described the end state) also use the words: "an explosion from  
within".
