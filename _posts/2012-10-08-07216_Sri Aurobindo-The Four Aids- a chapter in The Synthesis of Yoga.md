## Topic: How many days makes one mandalam?

I want to get clarified How Many days make one Mandalam. When do some stotra  
chanting ( like Vshnu Sahasranama etc ) for 1 Mandalam then does it mean we  
chant it for 40 days or 42 or 45 or 48 days ?   
Some say it is 40 but others give different nos. I know it does not matter  
much if we chant for few more days the names of God but just for technical  
purpose I want to know whether it is 40 days or more than 40 days so that  
when I finish exactly 1 Mandalam of Parayanam of any stotra then I can make  
some special dish as Prasadam and do a special Pooja for almighty after I  
complete 1 Mandalam and restart the next Parayana.   
So hoping for inputs from members here.   
Om Peace.

One Mandalam is 48 Days, it is said when somebody doing some particular  
Sadhana, one has to do it without fail for 48 days, one mandalam, only then  
will the Sadhana get the fruits of what tapas he performs.   
There are several scientific reasons for these calculations, i will get back  
to you once i gather more information.

Thanks Sri Nagaraj for this info. There was some confusion whether it is 40  
or 48 as some people said that Iyyappa devotees maintain 40 days vratham. As  
I said for me it does not matter chanting for a few more days but I want to  
know exactly when I complete 1 Mandalam so that on the day of conclusion I can  
do a better Puja and offer better Naivedyam and conclude it in a more  
enriching manner.

**The Concept of Grace**   
Each mind can have its own way of approaching the supreme Truth and there Is  
an entrance for each as well as a thousand ways for the journey to it. It is  
not necessary to believe in the Grace or to recognise a Godhead different from  
one's highest Self - there are ways of yoga that do not accept these  
things....   
For, as to this "Grace", we describe it in that way because we feel in the  
infinite Spirit or Self-existence a Presence or a Being, a Consciousness that  
determines, - that is what we speak of as the Divine, - not a separate person,  
but the one Being of whom our individual self is a portion or a vessel. But it  
is not necessary for every body to regard it in that way. Supposing it is the  
impersonal Self of all only, yet the Upanishad says of this Self and its  
realisation: "This understanding is not to be gained by reasoning nor. by  
tapasya nor by much learning, but whom this Self chooses, to him it reveals  
its own body". Well, that is the same thing as what we call the Divine Grace,  
- it is an action from above or from within independent of mental causes which  
decides its own movement. We can call it the Divine Grace; we can call it the  
Self within choosing its own hour and way to manifest to the mental instrument  
on the surface; we can call it the flowering of the inner being or inner  
nature into self-realisation and self-knowledge. As something in us approaches  
it or as it presents itself to us, so the mind sees it. But in reality it is  
the same thing and the same process of the being in Nature.

## Re:[16]Sri Aurobindo-Equality  
Author: Ravi.N              Date: February 20, 2015, 06:20:01 AM

**Equality**   
Equality is the chief support of the true spiritual consciousness and it is  
this from which a sadhak deviates when he allows a vital movement to carry him  
away in feeling or speech or action. Equality is not the same thing as  
forbearance, though undoubtedly a settled equality immensely extends, even  
illimitably, a man's power of endurance and forbearance.   
Equality means a quiet and unmoved mind and vital, it means not to be touched  
or disturbed by things that happen or things said or done to you, but to look  
at them with a straight look, free from the distortions created by personal  
feeling, and to try to understand what is behind them, why they happen, what  
is to be learnt from them, what is it in oneself which they are cast against  
and what inner profit or progress one can make out of them; it means self-  
mastery over the vital movements, anger and sensitiveness and pride as well  
as desire and the rest, not to let them get hold of the emotional being and  
disturb the inner peace, not to speak and act in the rush and impulsion of  
these things, always to act and speak out of a calm inner poise of the spirit.  
It is not easy to have this equality in any full perfect measure, but one  
should always try more and more to make it the basis of one's inner state and  
outer movements.   
Equality means another thing -to have an equal view of men and their nature  
and acts and the forces that move them; it helps one to see the truth about  
them by pushing away from the mind all personal feeling in one's seeing and  
judgment and even all the mental bias. __Personal feeling always distorts and  
makes one see in men 's actions, not only the actions themselves, but things  
behind them which, more often than not, are not there. Misunderstanding,  
misjudgment which could have been avoided are the result; things of small  
consequence assume larger proportions__. I have seen that more than half of  
the untoward happenings of this kind in life are due to this cause. But in  
ordinary life personal feeling and sensitiveness are a constant part of human  
nature and may be needed there for self-defence, although, I think, even  
there, a strong, large and equal attitude towards men and things would be a  
much better line of defence. But for a sadhak, to surmount them and live  
rather in the calm strength of the spirit is an essential part of his  
progress.   
 _The first condition of inner progress is to recognise whatever is or has  
been a wrong movement in any part of the nature, wrong idea, wrong feeling,  
wrong speech, wrong action, and by wrong is meant what departs from the truth,  
from the higher consciousness and higher self, from the way of the Divine_.  
__Once recognised it is admitted, not glossed over or defended, and it is  
offered to the Divine for the Light and Grace to descend and substitute for it  
the right movement of the true Consciousness__.

Nirvana or the Absolute Nirguna Brahman is the highest accomplishment.   
Sri Aurobindo's conclusions are not in tune with that of Advaita or Masters  
like Sri Ramana, Sri Nisarghadatta.   
He was a great yogi but he did not endorse advaita.   
Maharishee clearly spoke of the differences in his answers to one Swami from  
Gujarat ( power of presence)
