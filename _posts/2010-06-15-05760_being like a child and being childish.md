## Hanuman Chalisa - Verse 14 And 15  
Author: ramana_maharshi     Date: June 15, 2010, 01:14:57 PM  
---  
**Verse 14**   
 _Raghupati Kinhi bahut badai   
Tum mam priye Bharat-hi sam bhai_   
 **Verse 14 Meaning**   
 _Shri Raghupati (Shri Ram) lustily extolled your excellence and said: "You  
are as dear to me as my own brother Bharat."_   
 **Verse 15**   
 _Sahas badan tumharo yash gaave   
Us kahi Shripati kanth lagaave_   
 **Verse 15 Meaning**   
Thousands of living beings are chanting hymns of your glories;saying thus,  
Shri Ram warmly hugged him (Shri Hanuman).   
 **Commentary:**   
In Verse 14 Tulasidas tells us that Lord Shri Rama treats lord hanuman as his  
own brother bharat.   
We know that in ramayan bharat is son of kaikeyi who is 3rd wife of dhasarat  
maharaj.Because of manthra kaikeyi got spoiled and she did not allow Lord rama  
to be king as she wants her son bharat to be the king and made lord rama to go  
to exile(jungle) for 14 years.   
But bharat is a great admirer to Lord Rama and he did not admire to be the  
king in absence of Lord rama.   
So to conclude even in this verse 14 tulasidas wants to glorify the importance  
of bhakti(devotion) aspect.   
In Verse 15 Tulasidas tells us that lord shriram is very happy for his beloved  
"devotee" as many living beings are singing hymns of glories of lord hanuan.   
Though there may be many so called pesudo devotees and fake swamijis/gurus in  
this kali yuga but hard indeed is to get a devotee like Lord hanuman for Lord  
Shri Rama.   
Ramana Maharshi used to say   
People imagine that the devotees crowding around a jnani get special favours  
from him. If a Guru shows partiality, how can he be a jnani? Is he so foolish  
as to be flattered by people's attendance on him and the service they do? Does  
distance matter? The Guru is pleased with him only who gives himself up  
entirely, who abandons his ego forever. Such a man is taken care of wherever  
he may be. He need not pray. God looks after him unasked. The frog lives by  
the side of the fragrant lotus, but it is the bee that gets the honey.   
So here bee is lord hanuman and fragrant lotus is the guru/god/lord Shiram.   
For Sri RamaKrishna Paramahamsa Swami Vivekananda is the blessed devotee who  
has revived hinduism to the globe.   
Even for ramana maharshi there are many sincere devotees like  
Murugunar,Kavyakanta Muni,Suri Nagamma and many others.   
Guru ramana is indeed a blessed devotee/disciple for Lord Arunachala(Siva)  
which is again within and not outside.   
I am sure "Where can we get another like him" is our typical reaction when we  
hear life history of guru ramana maharshi.

All like child but do they like childish when we grow?   
But when jnani's case it is accepted. Reason.....

Dear ramanaduli garu,   
Bhagavan Ramana used to say: Every person should be like a child.Then one can  
get Brahmananda.   
Annamalai Swami asked: "Then what is the difference between a child and a  
Jnani?   
Bhagavan Ramana replied: A child does not know anything because of its pure ignorance.   
A Jnani does know everything because of his pure wisdom.   
 **Source** : Sri Ramana Ninaivugal - Tamil - Annamalai Swami.   
 _Once Dr Raju garu in this forum said_   
A child is childish and innocent with his tendencies lying inside in a dormant  
stage and spending up of tendencies not yet started,so his innocence may be  
contaminated at any time.   
 **Jnani is not chidish but have "child like" innocence but his innocence  
cannot be contaminated because his tendencies are destroyed once and  
forever.**
