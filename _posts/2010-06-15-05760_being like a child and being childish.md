All like child but do they like childish when we grow?   
But when jnani's case it is accepted. Reason.....

Dear ramanaduli garu,   
Bhagavan Ramana used to say: Every person should be like a child.Then one can  
get Brahmananda.   
Annamalai Swami asked: "Then what is the difference between a child and a  
Jnani?   
Bhagavan Ramana replied: A child does not know anything because of its pure ignorance.   
A Jnani does know everything because of his pure wisdom.   
 **Source** : Sri Ramana Ninaivugal - Tamil - Annamalai Swami.   
 _Once Dr Raju garu in this forum said_   
A child is childish and innocent with his tendencies lying inside in a dormant  
stage and spending up of tendencies not yet started,so his innocence may be  
contaminated at any time.   
 **Jnani is not chidish but have "child like" innocence but his innocence  
cannot be contaminated because his tendencies are destroyed once and  
forever.**
