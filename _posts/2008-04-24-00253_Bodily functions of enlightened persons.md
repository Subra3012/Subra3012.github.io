## Bodily functions of enlightened persons

Years ago when I was in primary school, a teacher told us that yogis, rishis  
and others in this category, will not eat, drink or defecate. I never gave  
serious thought to this. Now in my adult years, I keep wondering whether those  
in the spiritual path have discarded their bodily functions. Bhagawan had  
apparently overcome this obstacle when, as a youngster, he was meditating for  
days on end without a break. Do all those in the higher plane conquer their  
bodily functions? Have our scriptures mentioned this area?   
Thanks for any information.

Self-realized persons, definitely eat, drink and defacate. Only they   
do them, as if in a dream. They also sleep and dream. In one of   
Bhagavan's dreams, Major Chadwick (Sadhu Arunachala) had   
come. In old Tamil books, it is said that yogis/siddhas drink water and   
eat dry leaves/dropped fruits from trees.
