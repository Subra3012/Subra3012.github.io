How to see God?   
A Zen Master was meditating by a river side. A young man interrupted   
him, saying, "Master, I wish to become your disciple." The Zen   
Master asked: "Why?" The young man thought for a moment and   
replied: "Because, I want to find God."   
The Zen Master jumped up immeditely, grabbed him by the scruff of his   
neck, dragged him into the river and plunged his head under water!   
After holding him for a minute, when the student was kicking and   
struggling for life, the Master finally pulled him up out of the water.   
The young man coughed up water and grasped to get his breath.   
When he eventually quieted down, the Master spoke: "Tell me,   
what did you want most of all, when you were under water?"   
The young man answered: "Air!"   
"Very well", said the Master. He continued. "Go home and come   
back to me when you want to find God, as much as you have just   
wanted to breathe air!"

Swami Vivekananda says in slightly diff manner   
The master said, "My child, if you desire after God, God shall come to you."  
The disciple did not understand his master fully. One day both went to bathe  
in a river, and the master said, "Plunge in", and the boy did so. In a moment  
the master was upon him, holding him down. He would not let the boy come up.  
When the boy struggled and was exhausted, he let him go. "Yes, my child, how  
did you feel there;" "Oh, the desire for a breath of air!" "Do you have that  
kind of desire for God?" "No, sir." "Have that kind of desire for God and you  
shall have God."   
-Swami Vivekananda.
