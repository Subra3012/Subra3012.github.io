Please do not answer "Ask who am i" for any of these questions. The  
fundamental point is to understand the whole process of self inquiry  
correctly. Fortunately, repeating "who am i" is not self inquiry. And even  
asking "who am i" is not.   
What is Self inquiry ? Self inquiry is a systematic way of getting established  
in the Self. Its a method to become totally convinced that I am Self. One who  
is Self need not do inquiry. Only he who is not established in Self has to do.  
These questions are designed to explain the method of Self inquiry in a  
systematic way.

Udai Garu,   
My honest answers for the questionere:  **Question 1 Answer** : whenever i feel afraid or fear for something for  
some reason these days i am chanting   
Adi shankara's nirvana sathakam or recollect image of ramana maharshi.But i  
think i have no complete success in my effort always which means still my  
sadhana and faith is not perfect.   
 **Question 2 Answer** : Though i may feel little proud for a moment i  
immediately compare myself with ramana maharshi and then see how hopeless i am  
and my pride will vanish away.   
Also i try to remember below article whenever someone praises me   
http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/forum/index.php?topic=4609.0   
 **Question 3 Answer** : I feel nothing wrong.Infact i criticise myself and  
recently i revealed all my faults i had commited from my childhood to many of  
my friends/relatives which i think is very useful to eradicate ego/pride in us  
to some extent.   
 **Question 4 Answer** : Maybe if i face that situation then i patiently  
listen to him and when he left scold few little harsh words to myself.   
But Solution is to be straightforward in our life as far as possible.Even our  
guru ramana was pretty straightforward in many matters in his life.WE should  
remember we cannot satisfy everyone in our life IT IS NEVER POSSIBLE for  
anyone and even saints are no expection.

Question 1: e) do nothing;*   
Question 2: e) do nothing;*   
Question 3: e) do nothing;*   
Question4: e) do nothing;*   
* in a sense - be still. what can I do?   
Suppose a fear arises at the moment, what can I do, really? This is so, i  
cannot deny it, it is happening.   
The point is: why there should be concern about thoughts at all?   
This is my experience and view at the moment.

Dear Amiatall,   
Nice answers.   
Please explain a little more. There is fear means, you are already involved in  
it. isnt it ? you are already angry/afraid. How can you be still? To make  
yourself still, what do you do ? coz you are fuming with anger, let us say.  
how do you "become still" ? The blood is as if oozing out! how do u become  
still ?   
Love!

Dear srkudai,   
I shall take up only Question No. 1 first. Simple darkness in a room or a  
house where I am alone does not deter me, unless there is some   
knee pain or shooting hypertension causing giddiness. I shall do   
nothing but chanting within my lips the Maha Mantra given to me: Arunachala Siva, Arunachala Siva, till I get sleep. It has worked in   
my case quite well.   
Arunachala Siva.

dear srkudai,   
I don't know if I can say that I am involved when mind gets agitated. I cannot  
find words to explain it. "I" am ever still, no need to do anything to be  
still. Even if preconditioned fear or so arises out of nowhere it is  
recognized immediately and automatically for what it is. (the reason i cannot  
find words is because i don't remember actually the last time mind got  
agitated heavily, quite some time passed, the enquiry into the Self which  
Ramana got me involved in, now goes automatically, it seems like the  
appearance has nothing to do with I, like a dream, you can dream that you have  
such and such personality with bad and good qualities, but in reality you have  
nothing to do with a personality, so changing thoughts, changing expressions,  
changing understanding is still in that dream, it truly has nothing to do with  
liberation, not even that, the concepts (such as liberation) themselfs are of  
a dream. Some processes are going on with a body/mind but I am not concerned.  
Still, the whole time, through various experiences the knowledge "i am not the  
mind" lead me, but the paradox is that the knowledge and ignorance are of the  
mind itself.). Don't know why i am even writing this to you or comming here,  
but anyway i sense greatness in you have a nice evening.   
Am i disappearing? yes and no   
i am not, still i am   
Am i liberated? yes and no   
what is liberation? but a created concept which depends on AM   
I am at awe what these fingers tries to tell   
listen, the ego is truly the personification of hell   
Read these words that are flowing without a second thought   
What for, all the time, humans fought?   
Chithram Chithram!   
The first words that comes to mind   
To be written on the first line   
This is a great mystery indeed   
Why we seek Reality while being it.

Maybe this is a bit like your question 1.   
Some years ago I would wake in the night with an intense fear of dying. Like I  
was dying at that very moment. I knew of Self-Inquiry and what had happen to  
Ramana.   
All I could do was the think of the Self. I was too scared to ask as Ramana  
had. Night after night it would happen. It was really horrible. It's stopped  
now, and I feel I didn't use it as I should have. I would wish it back.

My own answers: Fear is a state of mind. When mind is full of thoughts of fear, and i am  
unconsciously identifying with the mind and saying "I am afraid". .. That is  
not the time to "Get rid of the state of mind". That is the time to  
"understand that the state of mind cannot touch me".   
Japam, Pranayamam etc are Excellent methods but misplaced here. if i repeat  
god's name, the state of mind changes. the mind becomes calm and the thoughts  
of fear are replaced with other thoughts. So there is feeling of comfort.   
But That is not what i want. i want to face it.   
When Shastras say "I Cannot be Touched By Thoughts". That means, i should see  
this. I should See how the thoughts of Fear Cannot Touch me, Who am  
Consciousness.   
"I am Afraid" is a misperception.   
"I Fear" is a misperception.   
Coz, I am Consciousness in whose presence these thoughts are floating.   
IF Thoughts are not "Touching" ME   
 Why do i need to do japam to remove the thoughts?   
If Thoughts are "Touching" Me,   
 Its Misperception, and i need to remind myself that i am Consciousness and Remain as Consciousness.   
I would Rather Stand in the Darkness. .. Allow the thoughts to pass. .. And  
Remain As Consciousness.   
Not trying to avoid the situtation. Not trying to run away. not trying any  
sort of ESCAPE.   
Japam is a method to remind myself that i am Consciousness... not a method to  
escape or change the states of mind.   
Love!   
Silence

Mind becomes calm, i say i am calm   
Mind becomes agitated, i say i am agitated!   
this is wrong understanding. mistaken vision.   
as long as i keep repeating this. .. i will keep trying to change mind.   
Somewhere i have to cut this Knot!   
I am not the mind! Therefore i do not resist what is happening in mind! its  
not my business!   
Mind Suggests fear, mind suggests running away, mind suggests lots of things.  
the whole body will react to mind... but i remain as consciousness...  
motionless... mind jumps for some time and finally gives way. its hard, but it  
is vanquishing the mind. disagree with it. it has no power of its own   
no thought of mind is a command. all thoughts are mere suggestions.We need not  
listen.   
This is Self Inquiry.
