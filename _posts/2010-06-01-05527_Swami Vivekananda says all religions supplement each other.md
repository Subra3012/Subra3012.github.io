**PRACTICAL VEDANTA PART II (Delivered in London, 12th November 1896)   
Give up the small for the Infinite, give up small enjoyments for infinite  
bliss.** It is all yours, for the Impersonal includes the Personal. So God is  
Personal and Impersonal at the same time.   
And Man, the Infinite, Impersonal Man, is manifesting Himself as person. We  
the infinite have limited ourselves, as it were, into small parts. The Vedanta  
says that Infinity is our true nature; it will never vanish, it will abide for  
ever. But we are limiting ourselves by our Karma, which like a chain round our  
necks has dragged us into this limitation. Break that chain and be free.  
Trample law under your feet. There is no law in human nature, there is no  
destiny, no fate. How can there be law in infinity? Freedom is its watchword.  
**Freedom is its nature, its birthright.** Be free, and then have any number  
of personalities you like. Then we will play like the actor who comes upon the  
stage and plays the part of a beggar. Contrast him with the actual beggar  
walking in the streets. The scene is, perhaps, the same in both cases, the  
words are, perhaps, the same, but yet what difference! The one enjoys his  
beggary while the other is suffering misery from it. And what makes this  
difference? The one is free and the other is bound.   
The actor knows his beggary is not true, but that he has assumed it for play,  
while the real beggar thinks that it is his too familiar state and that he has  
to bear it whether he wills it or not. This is the law. **So long as we have  
no knowledge of our real nature, we are beggars, jostled about by every force  
in nature; and made slaves of by everything in nature; we cry all over the  
world for help, but help never comes to us; we cry to imaginary beings, and  
yet it never comes.** But still we hope help will come, and thus in weeping,  
wailing, and hoping, one life is passed, and the same play goes on and on.   
So are our lives spent in hoping, hoping, hoping, which never comes to an end.  
**Give up hope, says the Vedanta. Why should you hope? You have everything,  
nay, you are everything. What are you hoping for? If a king goes mad, and runs  
about trying to find the king of his country, he will never find him, because  
he is the king himself. He may go through every village and city in his own  
country, seeking in every house, weeping and wailing, but he will never find  
him, because he is the king himself. It is better that we know we are God and  
give up this fool 's search after Him; and knowing that we are God we become  
happy and contented. Give up all these mad pursuits, and then play your part  
in the universe, as an actor on the stage.**

**THE WAY TO THE REALISATION OF A UNIVERSAL RELIGION   
(Delivered in the Universalist Church, Pasadena, California, 28th January  
1900)**   
 **Do religions contradict or supplement each other?  that is the question.I  
believe that they are not contradictory; they are supplementary. Each  
religion, as it were, takes up one part of the great universal truth, and  
spends its whole force in embodying and typifying that part of the great  
truth. It is, therefore, addition; not exclusion.**   
Then, again, we also know that there may be almost contradictory points of  
view of the same thing, but they will all indicate the same thing **.Suppose a  
man is journeying towards the sun, and as he advances he takes a photograph of  
the sun at every stage. When he comes back, he has many photographs of the  
sun, which he places before us. We see that not two are alike, and yet, who  
will deny that all these are photographs of the same sun, from different  
standpoints?Take four photographs of this church from different corners: how  
different they would look, and yet they would all represent this church. In  
the same way, we are all looking at truth from different standpoints, which  
vary according to our birth, education, surroundings, and so on.** We are  
viewing truth, getting as much of it as these circumstances will permit,  
colouring the truth with our own heart, understanding it with our own  
intellect, and grasping it with our own mind. We can only know as much of  
truth as is related to us, as much of it as we are able to receive. This makes  
the difference between man and man, and occasions sometimes even contradictory  
ideas; yet we all belong to the same great universal truth.   
 _In this line the Mohammedans were the best off; every step forward was made  
with the sword  the Koran in the one hand and the sword in the other: "Take  
the Koran, or you must die; there is no alternative! " You know from history  
how phenomenal was their success; for six hundred years nothing could resist  
them, and then there came a time when they had to cry halt. So will it be with  
other religions if they follow the same methods._   
The fact that all these old religions are living today proves that they must  
have kept that mission intact; in spite of all their mistakes, in spite of all  
difficulties, in spite of all quarrels, in spite of all the incrustation of  
forms and figures, the heart of every one of them is sound  it is a  
throbbing, beating, living heart. They have not lost, any one of them, the  
great mission they came for. And it is splendid to study that mission. _Take  
Mohammedanism, for instance. Christian people hate no religion in the world so  
much as Mohammedanism. They think it is the very worst form of religion that  
ever existed. As soon as a man becomes a Mohammedan, the whole of Islam  
receives him as a brother with open arms, without making any distinction,  
which no other religion does. If one of your American Indians becomes a  
Mohammedan, the Sultan of Turkey would have no objection to dine with him._   
If he has brains, no position is barred to him. In this country, I have never  
yet seen a church where the white man and the negro can kneel side by side to  
pray. Just think of that: Islam makes its followers all equal  so, that, you  
see, is the peculiar excellence of Mohammedanism. In many places in the Koran  
you find very sensual ideas of life. Never mind. **What Mohammedanism comes to  
preach to the world is this practical brotherhood of all belonging to their  
faith.** That is the essential part of the Mohammedan religion; and all the  
other ideas about heaven and of life etc.. are not Mohammedanism. They are  
accretions.   
 **With the Hindus you will find one national idea  spirituality. In no other  
religion, in no other sacred books of the world, will you find so much energy  
spent in defining the idea of God.** They tried to define the ideal of soul so  
that no earthly touch might mar it. The spirit must be divine; and spirit  
understood as spirit must not be made into a man. The same idea of unity, of  
the realisation of God, the omnipresent, is preached throughout. They think it  
is all nonsense to say that He lives in heaven, and all that. It is a mere  
human, anthropomorphic idea. All the heaven that ever existed is now and here.  
One moment in infinite time is quite as good as any other moment.   
**With the Christians, the central idea that has been preached by them is the  
same: "Watch and pray, for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand"  which means,  
purify your minds and be ready!** And that spirit never dies. You recollect  
that the Christians are, even in the darkest days, even in the most  
superstitious Christian countries, always trying to prepare themselves for the  
coming of the Lord, by trying to help others, building hospitals, and so on.  
**So long as the Christians keep to that ideal, their religion lives.**

Dear prasanth,   
Yes. All religions are supplementing each other. But it is only   
Hinduism and Buddhism are complementing each other to totally.   
Buddhism is the rebel brother of Hinduism. As regards other   
religions, they supplement each other in some aspects. In this   
context, Christianity, which preaches non violence (One who takes   
the sword will eventually die of the sword), comes to supplementation   
very much. I have not read much of Islam.   
Arunachala Siva.
