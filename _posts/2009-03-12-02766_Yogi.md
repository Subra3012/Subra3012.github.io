## The medicine to cure madness  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 13, 2009, 05:56:09 AM

Gopalakrishna Bharati was a singer and composer of karnatic music.   
He lived in 19th century. He has made a music-drama called Nandanar  
Charitram, about that great Siva devotee, Nandanar.   
He says in that work: "There is a medicinal herb in Thillai, Chidambaram. This herb has been  
carefully cultivated by a tiger and a snake. This medicine is   
beyond the reach of Brahma and Vishnu. Half of this medicine has   
already been consumed by Parvati. Even if you search the three worlds, you  
will not get this herb, unless you conquer your desires and anger. This  
herbal medicine will cure all your madness. But the herb itself is mad!"   
The medicine is Siva, Nataraja in Chidambaram. This was cultivated by  
Vyakrapada, the tiger and Patanjali, the snake. This could not   
be fathomed by Brahma and Vishnu. Parvati took half of this herb, by occuping  
his left side. You will not get this herb unelss you leave your anger and  
desires. This will cure our worldly delusion. But, this   
herb itself is mad, Siva is madcap.   
Bhagavan Ramana also sings in Arunachala Stuti Panchakam, "You are the  
medicine to cure my madness" (Arunachala Padigam V.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Yogi

I just want put this question on Yogis in Tiruvannamalai.   
Its like a poll question   
Do you believe that yogis in Tiruvannamalai are true to some extent.   
Do you believe in Siddhas in the hill exist.   
Do you believe in the flying yogi which made headlines in the news.   
Do you believe that a yogi exist in this modern world   
The reason for the questions is because ''In search for secret India'', Paul  
Burton travels up and down India visiting many people to find an answer to his  
quest in this timeless country. But finally he arrives back to Maharishi.   
And again, Maharishi is not there now, but one cannot argue that such yogis or  
rishees cannot exist in modern India. India cannot change from its culture  
and faith. They must exist and should we believe in them

Dear karthikeyan. M,   
Who is a Yogi? Yoga means union, the one who is united with the   
Self is a yogi. A Yogi may or may not have supernatural powers like   
flying, disappearing from the scene etc.,   
Siddhas are advanced Yogis, who continue to live in subtle form like a light.  
Siddhas are said to live in the Arunachala Hills, even today.   
They can be "seen" in the form of light or in any form, only by an equally  
matured Jnani. Bhagavan Ramana has 'seen' them. The flying yogi is not a  
myth, yogi can have such powers. But the news about flying yogis are not  
true. Perhaps, that yogi may be travelling in a supersonic plane! like  
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi or Osho!   
Arunachala Siva.

To such many similar questions put by devotees to Bhagawan, He says, let the  
Yogis be aside, first find out if 'you' 'I' exist! because such questions  
deviate our path and we tend to get lost in such mysteries!   
Nagaraj

i completely agree that search / belief in flying yogis / siddhas can distract  
us from our quest. But underpinning such beliefs is a yearning to step out of  
the boundaries of the physical self. Yogis and siddhas are "beings" who can  
bend the physical laws with their "powers". Somewhere within us going beyond  
the physical holds a lot of charm and romance and wonder and attraction, isn't  
it?   
But of course, we have to go beyond attractions...!

Dear munagala,   
Yes. It is human nature to acquire supernatural powers. But   
Bhagavan Ramana has said: "The Siddhis are like dreams. They   
are like magics."   
He has further said: "The magician while performing magic, knows   
that it is not true. But Siddhi-performing persons, are themselves   
deluded, thinking that it is true."   
But Siddhas are there in Arunachala Hills. They also say they are   
in Kollimalai, a hill near Ooty. They may be there in Himalayas too.   
But these Siiddhas are there, with a purpose, which we do not know.   
Arunachala Siva.
