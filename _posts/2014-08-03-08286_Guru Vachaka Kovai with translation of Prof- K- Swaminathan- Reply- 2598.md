Verse 1254 of Guru Vachaka Kovai of Muruganar: Invocation: Long live Aruna Hill. Long live   
Guru Ramana. Long live   
This garland of His sayings. May   
This Lamp lit to reveal transcendent   
Truth prove fruitful and spread far   
And wide the Light Supreme.   
(Tr. Prof. K. Swaminathan)   
Arunachala Siva.
