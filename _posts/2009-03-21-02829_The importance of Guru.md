Kavyakanta Ganapati Sastri is known for his great poetic skills in   
Sanskrit. Once in a debate with Amba Datta in Navadweepa, he   
made the following quizzical poems: 1\. Parvati does not even see Siva's face twice in a month. Why?   
Ans: Because twice in a month, there is fourth day moon (chaturthi),   
when one should not see the moon on that day. Since Siva has got   
a crescent moon on His head, Parvati does not see Him for two days   
in a month.   
2. There is a girl is shamelssly showing her breasts to her   
father in law, on a hot summer evening. Who?   
Ans: Hitumbi, the wife of Bheema, is having persipiration on a summer  
evening. She removes her upperclothes to get some air   
by fanning with that uppercloth. Her father in law (Vayu - air)   
is seeing her bared breasts! Bheema is Vayuputra. Hence Vayu is   
Hitumbi's father in law!   
Arunachala Siva.

## The importance of Guru

Bhagavan Ramana Himself has said on many occasions: The Guru   
is the most important of all. He is even more important than God.   
Even avataras of gods cannot match Guru.   
In Periya Puranam, we see many devotees who were only considering one of the  
Great Four as their Guru and they worshipped him. Appoothi Adigal held Tiru  
Navukkarasu as his Guru. Tiru Neela Nakkar and a few others were treating  
Jnana Sambandha as their Guru. Cheraman Perumal was treating Sundaramoorthy as  
his Guru, even   
though the latter was his best friend. They all got liberation only by  
worshipping their Gurus.   
Arunachala Siva.

I got the clarification from bhagawan, I looked at his picture once and I was  
totaly swallowed from light...I felt that he had accepted me as his devotee  
this moment...   
the next week I had several insights following this "happening"   
I knew that he would not leave me....   
I knew that he would watch over me on my spiritual path...   
I knew that I will meet alot of other teachers,a ll handpicked by him, and he  
will always speak through them in a way.....(I clearly felt this and also in a  
ways saw it happening; not a vision more a understanding)   
I felt that I just incarnated to be within his presence..almost like a soft  
command...   
in addition: also the date of my birth has the exact same numbers as the date of bhagawans  
enlightment....   
he is a true guru, not the only true sat-guru (as this is a seed to start a  
very centralized religion), but a true guru...somebody who gives your heart  
water...who makes you a human...   
postrations to bagawan
