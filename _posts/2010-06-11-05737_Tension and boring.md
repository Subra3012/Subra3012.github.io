## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Sri Rama Krishna says no use of mere lecturing and scholarship  
Author: prasanth_ramana_maharshiDate: June 14, 2010, 10:07:31 AM

**" What can you achieve by mere lecturing and scholarship without  
discrimination and dispassion? God alone is real, and all else is unreal. God  
alone is substance, and all else is nonentity. That is discrimination.**   
"First of all set up God in the shrine of your heart, and then deliver  
lectures as much as you like. How will the mere repetition of 'Brahma' profit  
you if you are not imbued with discrimination and dispassion? It is the empty  
sound of a conch-shell.   
"There lived in a village a young man named Padmalochan. People used to call  
him 'Podo', for short. In this village there was a temple in a very  
dilapidated condition. It contained no image of God. Aswattha and other plants  
sprang up on the ruins of its walls. Bats lived inside, and the floor was  
covered with dust and the droppings of the bats. The people of the village had  
stopped visiting the temple. One day after dusk the villagers heard the sound  
of a conch-shell from the direction of the temple. They thought perhaps  
someone had installed an image in the shrine and was performing the evening  
worship. One of them softly opened the door and saw Padmalochan standing in a  
corner, blowing the conch. No image had been set up. The temple hadn't been  
swept or washed. And filth and dirt lay every where. Then he shouted to Podo: You have set up no image here,   
Within the shrine, O fool!   
Blowing the conch, vou simply make   
Confusion worse confounded.   
Day and night eleven bats   
Scream there incessantly.. . .   
"There is no use in merely making a noise if you want to establish the Deity  
in the shrine of your heart, if you want to realize God. **First of all purify  
the mind.** In the pure heart God takes His seat. One cannot bring the holy  
image into the temple if the droppings of bats are all around. The eleven bats  
are our eleven organs: five of action, five of perception, and the mind.   
"First of all invoke the Deity, and then give lectures to your heart's  
content. First of all dive deep. Plunge to the bottom and gather up the gems.  
Then you may do other things. But nobody wants to plunge. **People are without  
spiritual discipline and prayer, without renunciation and dispassion. They  
learn a few words and immediately start to deliver lectures. It is difficult  
to teach others. Only if a man gets a command from God, after realizing Him,  
is he entitled to teach. "**

Now a days every one is saying there is full of tension and life is boring.  
Even a 1std school going kid is saying I got tensed and bored. Before 50 years  
it is not like that. Why it is happening? I think people is living far away  
from the natural life.   
Some where I read it... God gives gives gives and forgives   
but man gets gets gets and forgets.....   
no gratitude to anybody.

A person who was standing by, just watched some 8 - 10 people running  
frantically together each trying to run faster and faster. Seeing them he  
asked one of them, "hey, why and where are you guys running?,' to which, one  
guy who was running, turned his head, and as he was running, answered, "hmm, I  
don't know, I saw they were all running and so I also joined them, come you  
too join us"   
Thats how the world is functioning today, we're dancing to the dictates of the  
society and its trends!   
The society and its culture makes it mandatory to BE something, and  
practically imposes certain standards for happiness! They would be along the  
lines of: 1\. One should be very worldly wise - today we see kids who are catagorised a  
prodigy, there is immense presure on other kids and the spirit behind that is  
to outperform each other.   
2\. One's standard of living should be better than the others for happiness   
3\. One has to perform so many sacrifices and pujas so as to seem "pious" in  
the eyes of others for their happiness   
4\. One has to be very orthodox or very NON-orthodox to make a statement about  
oneself and one's happiness.   
5\. One has to own very many luxuries in order to be happy.   
6\. One has to be modern, and being religious is the straightest and shortest  
road to becomming an outcaste   
7\. Irony of ironies - Today if you follow rules you are termed "Gandhi", Its  
too cool to break rules, and pay couple of bucks to the cop and get away and  
talk about it to friends and laugh about it   
8\. You MUST be up to date on "current affairs", (which is invariably a  
rendition of other people's "affairs") daily happenings in the 24 Hr news  
channels and you need to giveout your "esteemed" opinions to the "stalwarts"  
to maintain your aura of intelligence and earn their respect and awe so that  
it may be of some use tomorrow (never mind that you don't even know what your  
parent / spouse / child likes, and you have no "time" to find out what they  
think or feel and if you even use the word Guru - damn you!!!)   
9\. You have to maintain relationships so that they could be of use to you  
tomorrow and NEVER for just pure love.   
10\. You ought to earn your food.   
11\. You should own a luxury car, bike, model house, have a cook, servent.   
12\. You should have some clout with some political guy or some big guy,   
13\. You should visit some new restaurents, pubs, mingle, especially if you  
are single!! (a bachelor who goes to the temple or reads a religious book is  
verily a freak of nature and should not be associated with at all, lest you be  
tainted as well. Sorrow of sorrows, it is mostly the parents who insist that  
these "abnormal" people be cut off from their childrens' lives)   
14\. Once in a year, go to Tirupathi, Srirangam, etc... and dissolve your  
Paapams or sins.   
15\. You have to be employed in a big company   
16\. You need to earn a minimum of 50k tp 1lac for a decent living   
17\. You should have travelled abroad, worked there and earned in dollars   
18\. Its cool to have your own house, 72" Plasma TV, Apple Mac comp, Ipod, and  
all the latest gadgets   
19\. Contrary to point 13, YOu should be too spiritual to leave a mark or  
statement, show everybody that you are apiritual, and you are close to Guru-  
hood. You should be associated with some organisations, spiritual  
org.Philanthropic org., Spiritual Gurus, Service oriented, etc... to raise  
your esteem and earn respect and admiration   
20\. You should leave your family and parents in dire want and perhaps even  
hunger and go do "service" in these organisations.   
21\. You should shout loudly at people when they make mistake and fight back  
for the same reason when somebody else shouts at us.   
22\. You should wear cool clothes, otherwise you belong to the old school of  
thought and hence have no place in the world... you are past your sell by  
date!   
23\. You should observe Madi and Aacharams to be too orthodox and earn the  
respect of being very orthodox   
24, you should know by heart all slokas, the Gita, Sahasranaamams etc.. so  
that you can sing to others just so that they know that you know all these  
even without seeing the script.   
25\. Gratitude, sharing happiness and sorrows are to be avoided for your  
happiness!   
26\. You will be made to not follow rules.   
27\. Even if you want a legal bill, you will not be given for it is stupid to  
pay tax.   
28\. Today, only if you decorate Gods in temple and at homes with countless  
flowers, you will experience divinity, and the presence of Gods   
29\. Killing cockroaches at home is essential   
30\. Ants get killed by themselves as they come on our way and we stamp them  
even without noticing it.   
31\. Stones are to be thrown at dogs, They cant come near you, we should get  
scared or shout at them and pish them off.   
32\. You should wear a new dress ever week atleast.   
33\. Have a cell phone, talk for long time, gossip   
34\. discuss others' personal life & pass judgement about what is right and  
wrong.   
35\. Make our lives "easy" by encouraging nuclear plant, modern vehicles,spoil  
the earth and then pop in Vitamin tablets.   
36\. When you go for Purohit duty, you phone should ring some cinema song, and  
you should talk in between homams and while chanting mantras.   
37\. Adamance can get you what ever you want, thats a cool attitude   
38\. You should have/own a Panchayatana Puja only after retirement, you should  
do Puja etc... only when we get time for it. (which is basically after you  
finish exporting your child to some fancy place abroad and are stuck alone and  
jobless at home - what our grandparents used to simply say - saagara  
kaalathula shankara shankaraa!! Meaning, you take the lord's name on your  
dying breath after wasting your entire life on frivolous and trivial things  
not even worth thinking about)   
39\. Learning vedas at young age is wasting time. there is time for all these  
in future, not now   
40\. Irregular food habits and at odd times.   
41\. By the age of 4 - 5 you should know your ambition, what you want to  
become, Doctor, Computer professional, etc... and also be able to dance like  
adults, sing like adults, talk like adults   
42\. you should be able to tell PJ's poor jokes and be smart   
43\. you should get within first 5 ranks   
44\. Its fashionable to be Naughty and Mischievous. .....   
The list can continue endlessly...   
One has to enquire Who am 'I' enquire into Self...

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Nagaraj has given an excellent reply. We are all running, running,   
running all through our lives with out being still and looking within.   
This tension in the worldly life is necessary to some extent. Otherwise, a  
person loses all motivation in life. One should   
neither be like high a strung bow nor like a bow where the string is loosened  
completely. There must be some spring action, in the bow.   
From another point of view, we are increasing our tension by increasing our  
desires. We keep on collecting trophies and the   
glass cupboard is full of trophies - still we do not stop. This is   
what is not advised in life.   
In management, they used to say, after careful preparation and   
winning an interview for promotion, the person promoted gets   
depression. This is called Success Depression. He does not   
sit and enjoy his promoted status. Somehow he feels depressed   
and restless. Why? Because he wants to quickly prepare for another  
promotional interview, this time the goal is a bigger cabin   
and three telephone lines and a more cozy sofa and a lot more of power!   
Where is the end?   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Nagaraj ji   
What you said it is 100% true. My childhood days were not like this. But I am  
worried to see my grand kid's days.   
There is no way to escape for them. They are trapped in this modern clutch.  
Every day every minute seeing them and comparing the life to olden days, I  
chant Bhagavan's name and His words.. who am I.   
The no.41 what you have quoted is 100% correct. In Madras, I do not want to  
tell the name of the school. when the parents go for the kid's admission they  
are asked by the school head master, which line you want to put your kid,  
whether doctor, engineer according to that field we would shape him.   
In my days, we were taught to be honest and true. At the end I feel I am not  
fit to this world.   
all parents want to be identified by their children like she is the mother of  
super kid, successful boy etc. etc.   
It is kali kalam. that is all.   
Ramanaduli

In response to the incident in Lakshmi's post, I thought this would be very  
appropriate. Anyone who ever has a child or is involved in any role in the  
upbringing of a child SHOULD read and remember this. These are the words of a  
famous poet...   
 **On Children**   
 _Kahlil Gibran_   
Your children are not your children.   
They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.   
They come through you but not from you,   
And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.   
You may give them your love but not your thoughts,   
For they have their own thoughts.   
You may house their bodies but not their souls,   
For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow,   
which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.   
You may strive to be like them,   
but seek not to make them like you.   
For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.   
You are the bows from which your children   
as living arrows are sent forth.   
The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite,   
and He bends you with His might   
that His arrows may go swift and far.   
Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;   
For even as He loves the arrow that flies,   
so He loves also the bow that is stable.

Dear Nagaraj ji,   
Very beautiful quotes. This should be printed as a greeting card and to be  
given to the people when they   
become a parent.

Dear I, (ramanaduliji)   
Yes, when we see the current scenario, we just feel the need for the people  
around, our society, culture to change for good, its our souls deepest desire  
for such happiness. Sri Ramana Bhagavan also says the same -   
Every souls desire for Happiness, and there is nothing wrong in it, but the  
only mistake we make is to depend our happiness on external change, but real  
happiness lies within ourselves. That happiness is absolutely independent from  
any external disturbances. The world will keep going, great souls like Sri  
Ramana Bhagavan keep coming to restore faith in humanity and Self.   
Even after any turbulance in our society, after hearing so many untoward  
incidents, etc.. when we look at Bhagavan, we get attracted to our Self, that  
eternal peace.
