though many may be aware of,

using just two our kitchen ingredients. when i recommended to to my relatives  
and friends most chronics got far better while border and others totally  
cured. at no appreciation to me i am prepared to share it when i am contacted  
either over phone[9731833455] or at mail drsdm23@gmail.com i  
am positive about the goodness of this.

## Physical healing  
Author: mcozire             Date: December 18, 2013, 05:57:27 PM

Hi all!   
It surprised me at first that there was no post on physical healing here on  
this forum, but then I realised that it must be because of the great faith  
that everyone here has in the words and grace of Sri Ramana Maharshi. I would  
like to think myself as being part of that great faith, and I know that we are  
not the body etc. and to me this is perfectly fine. However I am struggling at  
the moment because my aunty is having trouble with cancer.   
You hear in many other spiritual circles about healing, and a lot of healing  
is involved with the life of Jesus Christ.   
How do the lovely people here in this forum approach sickness with their loved  
ones?   
Many many thanks,   
Mark.

Dear friend,   
At the highest level we are non existent and hence there is no one who is  
suffering and no one who is witnessing the suffering.   
Accepting understanding of the above to the core of being is very difficult.   
Next level as a concession is that the one Brahman divides into several beings  
one among you being you and one your aunt.It is like there is the supreme  
Brahman and all of us beings are like hands and feet of that Brahman acting by  
means of that one power.   
These beings including ourselves appear in waking state and in some distorted  
form during sleep.   
It is the one supreme Brahman which moves all of us deciding our actions  
.Hence we are within the ambit of God all the time.   
Hence there is no suffering at all.All the time we are within God and he  
oversees our entire activity.   
Even our sadhana is his grace.Hence there is no suffering.   
Regards,   
Anand Sundaram.

## Re:[2]Love,always love and only love Physical healing  
Author: Jewell              Date: December 19, 2013, 02:45:19 AM

Dear mcozire,   
I experienced some similar things,and the way i delt with it is exactly the  
faith You mentioned. I prayed a lot,and i trusted all will be well. What i  
have noticed is,it is very important that that person believes he/see will be  
healed. I think that nothing is impossible with faith and trust,and most  
important,with God. I truly believe that. Miracles are possible,absolutely  
everything. His power is something which we can hardly understand. I also  
believe,all is His will only! And only by His Grace!   
Prayer can help a lot,and deep and pure faith. I witnessed that in my family  
too,and on my own example,so many miracles. With God by our side,we can move  
mountains. Like Jesus Himself said. Such is His Glory!   
So,whenever You can,talk with Your aunt not to lose faith. She must trust she  
can live,that is very important. Not to give up,NEVER to give up! She must  
believe in that! Talk to her whenever You can,persuade her she will be good.  
Our true nature is the Self only,And what we believe is very much important.  
In the end,it will happen what is best for her,and everybody. That is the  
beautiful law of nature,beautiful and merciful nature of God. He knows best.   
Truly,Faith is so powerful. It never,never never turned Its back upon me. We  
are all Divine,and all power is in us and God only. We only need to trust.  
Truly,is there is anything impossible for God!!!   
Whatever is needed to happen will happen. We only must be aware that nothing  
is as it seems,and all is for our good. This life is just a stage,and what we  
truly are can never die. What we are is Eternity.   
I delt with losses in this way. I missed them,but deep in my heart i know,they  
live always and truly,and they are never far from me,but in my very heart.  
There is no distance whatsoever.   
May Bhagavan's Grace be upon Your aunt and Your family,May His Love and Grace  
give her strength and courage to win this battle!   
With Love and prayers,

Dear mczozire, I am sorry for your aunt. Let her spirit strong. Don't let her  
lose hope and faith. Many people die just because of the fear of the  
diagnosis. With God's help everything is possible. She can survive this!

Dear Sri Graham,   
Thank You so much for sharing and explaining all this! It is truly a wonder  
what they can do,and how many ways they are using to jeopardize peoples  
privacy.   
I have noticed what You have said,about possibility to turn on our computer  
camera,and watch us. I am not sure is that is it,but once i have noticed sound  
like taking picture coming from my computer. From that moment,i put the  
sticker on my laptop camera.   
Thank You once more,Sir!   
With love and prayers,
