Q: When I wake up in the morning, the world is already there, waiting for me.  
Surely the world comes into being first. I do, but much later, at the earliest  
at my birth. The body mediates between me and the world. Without the body  
there would be neither me nor the world.   
M: The body appears in your mind, your mind is the content of your  
consciousness; you are the motionless witness of the river of consciousness  
which changes eternally without changing you in any way. Your own  
changelessness is so obvious that you do not notice it. Have a good look at  
yourself and all these misapprehensions and misconceptions will dissolve. Just  
as all the little watery lives are in water and cannot be without water, so  
all the universe is in you and cannot be without you.   
Q: We call it God.   
M: God is only an idea in your mind. The fact is you. The only thing you know  
for sure is: 'here and now I am'. Remove, the 'here and now' the 'I am'  
remains, unassailable. **The word exists in memory, memory comes into  
consciousness; consciousness exists in awareness and awareness is the  
reflection of the light on the waters of existence.**   
Q: Still I do not see how can the world be in me when the opposite 'I am in  
the world' is so obvious.   
M: Even to say 'I am the world, the world is me', is a sign of ignorance. But  
when I keep in mind and confirm in life my identity with the world, a power  
arises in me which destroys the ignorance, burns it up completely.   
Q: Is the witness of ignorance separate from ignorance? Is not to say: 'I am  
ignorant' a part of ignorance?   
M: Of course. **All I can say truly is: 'I am', all else is inference. But the  
inference has become a habit. Destroy all habits of thinking and seeing. The  
sense 'I am' is the manifestation of a deeper cause, which you may call self,  
God, reality or by any other name. **The 'I am' is in the world; but it is the  
key which can open the door out of the world. The moon dancing on the water is  
seen in the water, but it is caused by the moon in the sky and not by the  
water.   
Q: Like in a tri-dimensional picture, the light forms its own screen.   
M: Any comparison will do. **The main point to grasp is that you have  
projected onto yourself a world of your own imagination, based on memories, on  
desires and fears, and that you have imprisoned yourself in it. Break the  
spell and be free.**   
Q: Surely there is something valid and valuable in every approach.   
M: In each case the value lies in bringing you to the need of seeking within.  
Playing with various approaches may be due to resistance to going within, to  
the fear of having to abandon the illusion of being something or somebody in  
particular. To find water you do not dig small pits all over the place, but  
drill deep in one place only. Similarly, to find your self you have to explore  
yourself. When you realise that you are the light of the world, you will also  
realise that you are the love of it; that to know is to love and to love is to  
know.   
 **Of all the affections the love of oneself comes first. Your love of the  
world is the reflection of your love of yourself, for your world is of your  
own creation. Light and love are impersonal, but they are reflected in your  
mind as knowing and wishing oneself well.** We are always friendly towards  
ourselves. but not always wise. A Yogi is a man whose goodwill is allied to  
wisdom.

I AM is the experience, which is there, during wakefuless, dream   
and deep sleep states. All others are classified into prathyaksha,   
that which is seen. i.e the clouds are seen in the sky. Anumana,   
guessing - there is smoke in the hill and so there must be fire.   
Aparoksha, the experiential reality which is the Self or I am.   
The first two are only inferences.   
Arunachala Siva.
