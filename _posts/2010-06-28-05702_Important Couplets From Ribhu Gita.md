Some may argue that this universe of duality (multiple existences) is a  
factual second reality, clearly seen by the senses operated by the mind. But  
then, are the senses anything apart from the mind? Can they function without  
the support of the mind in which they are imbedded? What is this mind except a  
bundle of thoughts? What are thoughts except evanescent ripples in the still,  
limitless ocean of pure Being-Awareness-Self,which is the sole Existence  
without a second? (Ch. 2, v.34)   
 **The total discarding of the mind is alone victory,achievement, bliss, yoga,  
wisdom and liberation. The sacrifice of the mind is, in fact, the totality of  
all sacred sacrifices. (Ch.15, v.7)**   
Those engaged in the pursuit of knowledge of the Brahman-Self, happening to  
get involved in the mundane pleasures of sex, should regard such pleasures as  
merely faint shadows of the bliss of the Self. **They should never even dream  
of worldly pleasures. (Ch.20, v.45)**   
 _There are no such things as achieved objectives and the efforts leading to  
them, association with the wise or the ignorant, efforts of learning and  
knowledge acquired,acts of enquiry and practice, the learner or the learned,  
and any goals achieved.What exists is only Brahman, the effulgent Awareness-  
Self.(Ch.23, v.10)   
In the conviction that I am the Self  in which no thought, ego, desire, mind  
or confusion can exist one should abide still, free from trace of thought.  
(Ch.26, v.31)   
It is only the mind which appear as the world and bondage; there is no world  
other than the mind. On enquiry this mind turns out to be nothing more than a  
group of ripples (thoughts) in the still ocean of pure Awareness-Siva-Self. I  
am that Siva-Self only and there is nothing apart from me, one should ever  
abide in the conviction born of this experience. (Ch.32, v.33)_   
If this world of the waking state is not evanescent in its nature, whatever is  
seen in the waking state must be seen during sleep also. Since I as pure Self  
exist alone and always,there is no room for thought of non-Self-world. I-Self-  
Brahman is the sole Existence. (Ch.35, v.24)   
Only those who contemplate on Lord Siva-Self,the pure supporting screen of all  
manifestation, gain the pure experience of sahaja nirvikalpa samadhi. **Apart  
from this devotion to Lord Siva (the Pure-Alert-Awareness-Self ) there are no  
other means leading to liberation. (Ch.35, v.44)**

Of course, N.R. Krishnamurty Iyer has compiled the essence from the whole of  
Ribhu Gita. The reading of all the verses of Chapter 26 is also recommended  
by Bhagavan Ramana for spiritual advancement.   
Arunachala Siva.
