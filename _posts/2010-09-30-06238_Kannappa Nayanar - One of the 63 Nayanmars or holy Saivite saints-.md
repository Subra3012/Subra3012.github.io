Eknath Easwaran (December, 1910 â October 26, 1999) is known as a spiritual  
teacher and the author of books on meditation and how to lead a fulfilling  
life, as well as a translator and interpreter of Indian literature.   
In 1961 Easwaran founded the Blue Mountain Center of Meditation and Nilgiri  
Press, based in northern California. Nilgiri Press publishes over two dozen  
books he authored.   
Eknath Easwaran was influenced by Gandhi, whom Easwaran met when he was a  
young man. Easwaran developed a method of meditation â silent repetition in  
the mind of memorized inspirational passages from the world's great  
religionsâ which later came to be known as Passage Meditation.   
Eknath Easwaran was born in 1910 in a village in **Kerala**, British India.  
Eknath is his surname, Easwaran his given name. Brought up by his mother, and  
by his maternal grandmother whom he honored as his spiritual teacher, he was  
schooled in his native village until the age of sixteen, when he went to  
attend a Catholic college fifty miles away. Here he acquired a deep  
appreciation of the Christian tradition. He graduated at the University of  
Nagpur in English and law. He served as Professor of English literature at the  
University of Nagpur.   
In 1959, he came to the United States as a Fulbright Scholar at the University  
of California, Berkeley.   
From 1960 he gave classes on meditation in the San Francisco Bay Area.   
 **His first major work was his 3-volume commentary on the Bhagavad Gita**,   
the Bhagavad Gita for Daily Living, the first volume of which was printed in  
1975 and the last in 1984. His book Meditation on the program of meditation  
and allied discplines that he developed first appeared in 1978.   
Essence of the Upanishads, originally entitled Dialogue with death: The  
spiritual psychology of the Katha Upanishad, and explains how the Katha  
Upanishad embraces the key ideas of Indian spirituality within the context of  
a powerful mythic quest â the story of a young hero who ventures into the  
land of death in search of immortality. "Essence of the Upanishads is a  
westerner's guide to this vitally important Indian text and its modern  
relevance to the Indian mindset and spirituality."   
The 3 volumes of the Bhagavad Gita for Daily Living are conceived as handbooks  
for applying the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita to lives today. End of Sorrow  
concentrates on the individual â how one can discover one's innermost  
nature, and transform one's life through self-realization, selfless service,  
and meditation. Like a Thousand Suns addresses relationships â how one can  
heal divisions in society, within one's relationships, and within oneself, and  
realize the unity governing all creation. To Love is To Know Me gives a global  
view, describing what individual readers can do to make a difference in the  
world today, and ends with a description of bhakti yoga, the path of devotion.   
Gandhi the Man traces how Mohandas Gandhi transformed himself into one of the  
world's great spiritual leaders.   
Easwaran's program for spiritual growth consists of eight points was  
introduced with his 1978 book Meditation. Each point had a dedicated chapter:  _Meditation: Silent repetition upon memorized inspirational passages from one  
of the world 's great religions. Practiced for one-half hour each morning.   
The Mantram: silent repetition of a mantram, holy name or hallowed phrase from  
one of the world's great religions.   
Slowing Down: set priorities to reduce stress and hurry   
One-Pointed Attention: give full concentration to whatever matter is currently  
at hand   
Training the Senses: enjoy simple pleasures in order to avoid craving for  
unhealthy excess   
Putting Others First: denounce selfishness and cultivating altruism   
Spiritual Companionship: practice meditation in the company of others   
Reading the Mystics: draw inspiration from the writings of the scriptures of  
all religions._

## Kannappa Nayanar ( One of the 63 Nayanmars or holy Saivite saints)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannappa_Nayanar   
Kannappa Nayanar or **Kannappan was one of the 63 Nayanmars or holy Saivite  
saints, the staunch devotees of Lord Shiva.** The Periyapuranam compiled by  
Sekkizhar and also the Tiruthhthondar Thogai by the poet-saint Sundarar  
enlists the 63 Nayanars.   
Kannappa Nayanar was born in a tribal family in and around the temple town of  
**SriKalahasti, in present day Andhra Pradesh.** He was named Thinnan or  
Dheeran or Boya Tinnadu by his parents.   
He hunted in the forest around SriKalahasti and the hills - Sripuram and  
Mummidi-cholapuram.   
Thinnan was a staunch devotee of the Vayu linga of SriKalahasti which he found  
in the forest while hunting. Being an illiterate and of a low-caste birth, he  
did not know how to properly worship Lord Shiva.   
 **It is said that he poured water from his mouth on the Shiva lingam which he  
brought from the nearby river Swarnamukhi. He also offered the Lord whatever  
animal he hunted, including swine flesh. But the Lord accepted his offerings  
since Thinnan was pure at heart and his devotion was true.**   
One day, Lord Shiva tested the unshakable devotion of Thinnan. With his divine  
power, He created a tremor and the roof-tops of the temple began to fall. All  
the sages ran away from the scene except for Thinnan who covered the linga  
with his body to prevent it from any damage. Hence he was named thereafter as  
Dheeran.   
In another incident (thiru vilayadal of Lord Shiva), one day Thinnan or  
Dheeran noticed that one of the eyes of the Shiva linga was oozing blood and  
tears. Sensing that the Lord's eye had been injured, Dheeran proceeded to  
pluck his one eye out with one of his arrows and placed it in the spot of the  
bleeding eye of the Shiva linga. This stopped the bleeding in that eye of the  
linga.   
But to complicate matters further, he noticed that the other eye of the linga  
has also started oozing blood. So Thinnan thought that if he were to pluck his  
other eye too, he would become blind to exactly know the spot where he has to  
place his own second eye over the bleeding second eye of the lingam. So he  
placed his great toe on the linga to mark the spot of the bleeding second eye  
and proceeded to pluck out his other and only eye.   
 _Moved by his extreme devotion, Shiva appeared before Thinnan and restored  
both his eyes.   
"Nillu Kannappa" ("Stop Kannappan!")_   
He made Thinnan as one of the Nayanmars and henceforth he would be called as  
Kannappan or Kannappa Nayanar.   
 **On the southern hill of the Kalahasti Temple, there is the shrine of  
Kannabeswara in his memory (Kannappa = Thinnan, eswara = Shiva which means  
"Kannappa, the devotee of Shiva").**   
Some Saivite traditions believe that Kannappa was the reincarnation of the  
Pandava - Arjuna. Arjuna worshipped Siva for seeking the Pasupatha Astra (a  
divine weapon) and failed to recognize Shiva when He appeared before Arjuna in  
the form of a hunter. Thus, due to this reason, Arjuna had to be born as  
Thinnan/ Kannappa, the hunter and adore the Lord before attaining final  
liberation. This belief is not adopted by all Hindus though.

Dear prasanth,   
Nice post. Kannappa is one of the earliest Saiva Devotees among   
those mentioned in Periya Puranam. He and Karaikal Amma are said   
to have lived in 3rd Century AD. Periya Puranam is compiled in 10th   
Century AD. Many many poets have sung the glory of Kannappa in   
their own works. He attained Siva padam in 6 days. Saint Poet   
Ramalinga Swamigal says about 3 saints in his song and wails that   
he is not able to be like any one of them. One is Siruthondar who   
cooked his son as meat for Siva devotee. The Second is Tiru Neela   
Kanta Kuyavanar [the potter], who stayed away fro his wife for the   
latter's doubt about his fidelity and told him not to touch her in the   
name of Tiru Neela Kantam [the god whose neck is blue]. The Third   
is Kannappa. Ramalinga Swamigal says: "I am not able to attain   
You in 4 +2 [Nalaru NaaL] six days by fixing my eye on yours.."   
What is the use of my birth?   
Stories are no doubt there that Arjuna was born again as Kannappar. Periya  
Puranam does not mention it so. However there are stories in others' works.  
Kannappa could do that surrender in 6 days because he had a lot of good  
vasanas through his earlier birth. This point   
is mentioned by Sekkizhar.   
Arunachala Siva**

Dear prasanth,   
**   
You are correct about the information that Arjuna was reborn as   
Kannappa. This is mentioned only by Nakkirar [not the Nakkirar   
who was having an argument with Siva in Pandya's court] in   
his poem in XI book of Saiva Canons. There he mentions: Siva told Arjuna: "You have obtained Pasupatam only through your   
fight and intense tapas. However, you will be re-born as one Kannappa in  
hunters' tribe and attain mukti out of pure love for me.   
I consider love towards me as more important than tapas to reach   
me."   
Kannappa was an illiterate. He was born in hunters tribe and ate meat. He  
had no tapas, love or vicharam towards Siva. But he developed intense love  
and deovtion towards Siva in Kalahasti temple and was prepared to sacrifice  
even his eyes on seeing there   
was bleeding from Siva's eyes. This love made him to attain Siva   
and Siva himself said: "Stop, stop, [do not dig out your other eye also]."   
Arunachala Siva.**

Dear prasanth,   
Saint Manikkavachagar sings Kannappar's ecstatic love for Siva in two   
verses. First is in Tiru Kothumbi [Decad on King Bee], Verse 4: After seeing matchless love of Kannappa, you have taken into consideration  
even my love towards you as worthy and have taken   
hold of me. You have called me to come to Your abode. Go   
and sing O King Bee, his glory and grace that is like rains from the sky, go  
and sing his glory of my Master, who wears spotless white   
ashes all over his body.   
In Verse 3 of Tiru ThoL Nokkam [Decad on looking at the shoulders],   
the saint poet sings: Not considering all the pujas done with money and wealth as worthy,   
you loved the pujas with sandalwear and took the waters from his mouth as if  
it is nectar. You became immensely happy with his love,   
graced him. Let us look at his shoulders and sing.   
Arunachala Siva.

Muruganar Swamigal asked Bhagavan,why Siva was so cruel as to make Kannappa  
nayanar, to offer his another eye too. Plucking and offering one eye to the  
Lord by itself was unparellel sacrifice and devotion. Siva ought to have  
prevented the repetition of such gory act.   
 To this doubt, Bhagavan clarified that as per Kalahasthi Puranma,Arjuna was  
reborn as Kannappar. Arjuna was so proud and conscious of his beautiful eyes  
with which he enticed many women. This deep attachement stood in the way of  
his liberation. In fact,during Mahabaratha times, when Arjun did penance, Siva  
was so pleased with his tapas and was ready to confer Moksha. Instead of  
asking for Moksha/Liberation,Arjuna wanted Pasupathartha-a deadly weapon to  
defeat his enemies. Thus, he got the weapon he wanted.Only after the birth of  
Kannappa,he got over his bodily attachment,exhibited his exemplary devotion  
and attained liberation.

Dear arcsekar,   
I am very happy you mentioned about Bhagavan Ramana's explanation. In Guru  
Vachaka Kovai, Muruganar writes in Verse 164:-   
The Saint Kannappa's love for Siva was so boundless, he gouged   
out his eye and fixed it on Siva's face. Yet even for him, a trace of   
"I am the body" remained through the feeling that he had beautiful   
eyes until he gouged one out and offered it to Siva. So, the complete  
annihilation of the ego is extremely difficult indeed.   
David Godman adds after his translation of the verse: .... The idea that Kannappa had a trace of the "I am the body" feeling because  
he felt he had beautiful eyes is not present in the   
original Periya Puranam. Bhagavan Ramana alluded to the story that   
He wrote the following lines in Ramana Puranam [which was from   
Muruganar but completed by Bhagavan Ramana in Sri Ramana Sanndhi Murai].   
You who are as clearly perceivable   
as a fruit of the nelli tree   
in [the palm of] one's hand,   
to those true devotees   
in whom a deep devotion to Lord Siva   
has been stirred up,   
filling their hearts to overflowing,   
and who have truly   
entrusted themselves to his feet,   
even if,   
like the huntsman Kannappa of Kalatti*   
whose love was great indeed for Kuduiatteva**   
the father of the expanse of consciousness.   
they are uneducated,   
unable to even count or read!   
 [Ramana Puranam lines 387 to 392; Tr. David Godman]   
Verse 165 of GVK: By accepting, when it was offered to Him, the eye of Kannappa,   
who was proud of his eyes, it was the intention of the Lord with an eye on His  
forehead, [Siva] to avoid the ruination of his devotee   
through having the evil belief that the inert body is "I". This is the   
glory of devotion to Siva.   
Arunachala Siva.**
