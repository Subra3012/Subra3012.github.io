Is it good to meditate when our mind is got disturbed or just sit and watch  
how we are suffering and feeling low.   
Is this way Bhagavan teach us means just watch the mind instead of  
doingmediate?

Dear ramanaduli,   
Bhagavan Ramana said that meditation for a fixed time,   
is good in the beginning. In due course, one can increase   
the time depending upon his work. At a mature stage, the   
meditation will become permanent amidst work and other   
demands. Disturbance through the thoughts can come   
at anytime, when one mediates or not. The suggestion   
is to bring back the mind, with one thought say, a nama   
of god, like showing some grass to the wayward bull   
and bringing it back to the shed.   
Arunachala Siva.
