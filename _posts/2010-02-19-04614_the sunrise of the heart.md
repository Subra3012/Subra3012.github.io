## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయDont be a spiritual Donkey

Once a sculptor in a village made a beautiful idol of a goddess and thought of  
selling it at a good price in the city. So he loaded the idol on his donkey  
and started towards the city. When he was going through the village, the  
villagers bowed in front of the idol as it looked like a real goddess.  
Whichever street he crossed, a crowd would bow in front of the idol.   
But a strange thing happened. The donkey, which was carrying the idol, thought  
that he was special and that was the reason why people were bowing to him. He  
was thrilled with his newfound respect.   
Soon the sculptor returned after selling the idol. While he was crossing the  
village, the donkey stopped in the middle of the road, expecting a warm  
welcome. But nobody paid attention to him. The donkey felt insulted and  
started braying, so much so, that the villagers drove him away.   
The same mistake, what the donkey did, is what most of us do. When we are on  
the divine path of self-realization, with God's grace, a glow enters our  
demeanor and we stand out in the crowd. People respect such persons and often  
bow in respect. But we should realize that people are bowing not to us but to  
that glimpse of God whom they realize resides within us. So the credit of this  
respect goes, solely to God, not to us. If we start taking the credit, we  
cross the thin line of demarcation and enter into an area of false ego, which  
God dislikes most.   
The basic difference between material and devotional lifestyle is that, in  
material life the more we progress, the more ego we develop. In a devotional  
lifestyle, the more we progress, the more ego we shed.   
**Purport** : The person in material consciousness is convinced by false ego that he is the  
doer of everything. He does not know that the mechanism of the body is  
produced by material nature, which works under the supervision of the Supreme  
Lord. The materialistic person has no knowledge that ultimately he is under  
the control of Krishna. The person in false ego takes all credit for doing  
everything independently, and that is the symptom of his nescience.   
-Bhagavad-gita 3.27

Dear prasanth_ramana_maharshi,   
Nice story. In today's world considering the large number of self appointed  
spiritual leaders under the garb of devotion, it might be better to conclude  
this way: If we develop more ego, we are living a material life. If we shed  
ego, we are living a devotional life.

Dear prasanth,   
Excellent story. Just because one carries Who am I? with him, he does not  
become   
a self realized person, "though carrying and reading it daily may prepare one  
in the   
path." Brahmasri Nochur Venkataraman.   
Arunachala Siva.

Then, one day, after a shot, the Master made a deep bow and broke off the  
lesson,   
" Just then 'It' shot! " he cried, as I stared at him bewildered.   
And when I at last understood what he meant I couldnt suppress a sudden whoop  
of delight.   
" What I have said ", the Master told me severely,   
" was not praise, only a statement that ought not to touch you.   
Nor was my bow meant for you, for you are entirely innocent of this shot.   
You remained this time absolutely self−oblivious and without purpose in the  
highest tension,   
so that the shot fell from you like a ripe fruit.   
Now go on practising as if nothing had happened."   
(from 'Zen in the Art of Archery')

Nice post.   
Lets keep it simple: who wants a credit?

Certainly. One cannot ever become self-realized, for the one who wants to  
become self realized is the same "donkey who wants a credit".   
Who is this donkey, if inquired earnestly, this won't allow for Mr.Creditor to  
rise.

Dear Subramanian,   
Even the Bible has the same analogy.   
"Not every one who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven,  
but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven. Many will say to me  
on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name? Did we not drive  
out demons in your name? Did we not do mighty deeds in your name?' Then I will  
declare to them solemnly, 'I never knew you.' (Matthew 7:21)

Dear grhluna,   
Nicw. Once some devotee wanted to take Bhagavan Ramana in a special   
train throughout India, so that He could see places! Bhagavan Ramana   
said: You are taking me, alright, but what can I see? (He is seeing nothing  
but the Self.).   
Sri Abhirami Bhattar who was a devi (goddess)-upasaka says in his poem: The the Redness of the Sun, and the Redness of the Heart, she stays in   
both the Red, the Lady with red-lotus like breasts! I see the red-lotus in   
her eyes, with nothing but compassion for me. Her face itself is a Red   
Lotus, and I see nothing but motherliness in her face. She is full of mercy  
and she gives me with her red-lotus like hands, and her two feet are like   
two lotuses.   
Sri Bhattar, sees in the sun and in the eyes, limbs and face of Mother   
only the Red Sun, which is metaphysical symbolism for Heart-Centre.   
Arunachala Siva.
