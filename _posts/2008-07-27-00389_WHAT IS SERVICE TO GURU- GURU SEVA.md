## Uddava Gita  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: July 27, 2008, 10:55:03 AM

Uddava Gita is the parting instructions of Sri Krishna, to Uddava,   
before he left the earth. It appears as Chapters 6 to 29 of XI   
Skanda of Srimad Bhagavatam. It is here the famous Avadhuta's   
story comes. The twenty four chapters sums up the essence of   
various paths like Karma, Bhakti, Yoga and Jnana. A sample,   
" He the Supreme Lord of the high and low, remains as a mass   
of transcendent Knowledge and Bliss, known as the Absolute,   
and without attributes." (Sloka 18 of Chapter IV)   
" There, O Uddava! dwelling on your own Self, till the attainment   
of realization, be endowed with knowledge and bliss and worship   
Me with devotion." (Sloka 17 of Chapter IX)   
" That which, when one object is transformed into another, abides   
at its beginning, middle and end, and remains when those objects   
return to their cause, is verily the Real." (Sloka 17 of Chapter XIX)   
" It is the body which, directed by something, works and is   
modified till death, but the man of realization, with his desire   
quenched by experiencing the bliss of the Atman, even though   
he is in the body, is not affected by work." (Sloka 30 of Chapter XXIII)   
" Ideas of rivalry, jealousy, pity and egoism quickly depart from a   
man who thinks of Me abiding in all men." (Sloka 15 of Chapter XXIV)   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai, there is a beautiful translation in English,   
published by Sri Ramakrishna Math. There is also   
a Tamil translation by Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai.   
Arunachala Siva.

My dear Sankar, Your understanding is correct. Bhagavan says   
in Who am I? : "if one knows that whatever he gives to others,   
he is giving to himslef, no one will stop from giving." Contemplate   
on these words carefully. If one gives love to others, he is giving   
love to himself. If one gives hatred to others, he is giving hatred   
to himself. If one gives pleasure to others, he is giving pleasure to   
himself. If one gives pain to others, he is giving pain to himself.   
If one gives good to others, he is giving good to himself. If one   
gives bad to others, he is giving bad to himself." If one knows   
this, he will give to others only what is suitable for him to get back.   
This was told by Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi, to Sivaprakasam Pillai,   
at the age of 21! This is the only teaching of Bhagavan, from where,   
he never went back in his 54 years of life in Tiruvannamalai.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, Doing service to the Guru, may mean services like   
attending to the Guru's bodily needs, when he is in body. Like   
giving him food, water, giving medicines to his ailments etc.,   
When the Guru has shed his body, the service is to read and follow   
his teachings. Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi goes one step further   
and says that the guru-seva or service to the guru, IS ONLY STAYING   
IN THE SELF. In Viveka Choodamani, Sankara says the same thing.   
The service to the guru, is remaining in his 'tattva' that is, his teaching,   
that is staying in the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.

Serving the master(Guru) is to surrendering to him.   
Master is nothing other than our self.   
So surrendering our mind to the self amounts to serving the master who is our  
self.

Dear DRKPSSN Raju, you are correct. Serving the master   
is serving the Self. It is not going to Sri Ramanasramam   
and sweeping the floor. In fact, Bhagavan chided one Western   
devotee, when he tried to do all these things. In Viveka   
Choodamani, Sankara says, the best Guru seva is being in   
the Self, always contemplating on the Guru.   
Arunachala Siva.

Origin is self and the manifestations are the result of it's imaginary

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, you are correct. Being and doing are

the Activity. The M and E of Einstein.
