## staying at Arunachala Asramam  
Author: jozia               Date: January 05, 2007, 03:41:03 PM

I have checked out both of these new web-sites and note that no-where does it  
mention whether it is still possible to stay at Arunachala Ashramam as in the  
past.   
Can one still do this ? (I haven't been there yet). And will the ashram still  
send-out taxis to the airport as in the past ?   
Thank you,   
Jozia

I think, you better contact Shri Ramanashramam authority. Here is the link to  
"Contact Us" page from the new site: http://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/contactus.html   
That's what I did when I last visited the Ashramam.

**OM NAMO BHAGAVATE SRI RAMANAYA**   
Hello Krishnaji,   
How was the weather when you were there?   
I normally go during the end of August or early Sept and the weather is  
generally good- not too hot or wet.   
The last time I went in April and got fried!   
I shall be going end of July and wonder what the weather will be.

Dear Sir,   
The weather is now far better, there are heavy winds without rain and not  
storm like. In July it will further improve.   
I am a AC addict. But when I bear the heat in thiruvannamalai, it is a  
divine prasad, a burning brazer of our bad karma.   
Arunachalam.

dear sundaram sir,   
I saw in this forum private message that you have written to my gmail. But in  
office I could not open that mailbox. I am waiting for the weekend to open it  
as I am all the more eager and dont have internet connection at home.   
Will soon have the blessings to hear your voice sir.

Thanks Krishnaji for the information. I like your viewpoint about the  
Tiruvannamalai heat - so optimistic and positive! That's what they call  
"turning defeat into victory" and "turning pain into ectasy"!!

all said and done i wish to submit that whatever be the inherited whether  
conditions to be, say,even in acute summer, it is a fact one can not feel heat  
when one is in Ramanasramam and around in that sober, sacred, ambiance.
