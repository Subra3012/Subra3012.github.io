## An incident of Lord Buddha  
Author: silentgreen         Date: January 05, 2010, 07:38:12 AM

This is an incident in the life of Lord Buddha.   
Lord Buddha went for begging in a house. The householder instead of giving any  
alms starting scolding Lord Buddha in various ways like: such an able-bodied  
person who is a prince and could have done great good to the world by working  
is now begging. Its a shame, etc.   
Lord Buddha listened to him calmly and after he finished, asked whether he  
(Buddha) can ask a question. The person allowed. Lord Buddha asked that if a  
parcel is sent to somebody and the receiver does not receive it, to whom does  
the parcel belong to? The man said that in that case the parcel should come  
back to the sender. Lord Buddha said that he had not received whatever the  
person has said, and left.   
This incident is quite well-known and although humorous is at the same time  
profound.   
When a person thinks ill of others, the person should first need to create  
that "ill" in his own mind.

Dear Sri Graham,   
I wish you a very happy New Year 2010, with continued abundance   
of Bhagavan's Grace. I had been at T'malai from 28th Dec. 2009   
to today, 1st Jan 2010, (upto 2.30 PM). Bhagavan's Jayanti was   
celebrated with joy and happiness, with Ekadasa Rudram and other   
songs. And it is the day of Smt. T.R. Kanakkamal's liberation and   
merger in Bhagavan's lotus feet. I was in the Samadhi Hall, at   
around 9 am., when that devotee had just entered the Samadhi Hall   
and within a minute or so, she merged with Bhagavan Ramana. It is   
Smt. Kanakammal, who has written a separate chapter on Bhagavan's   
humour, in one of her reminscences.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear I,   
Its a sad news at at the same time a good news, that you shared with us. I  
keep reading Smt. Kanakammal's Cherished Memories always, its an outpour of  
her love to he beloved Guru, Sri Ramana Maharshi. And what a perfect ending to  
her body? Its really a great miracle, that she should step inside the Samadhi  
Hall and merge with Sri Ramana Maharshi Himself. I was getting goosebumps as I  
read the news from your post. I was feeling really sad, for a great devotee  
has left this world, more appropriately left the physical memory of her in me.  
But She is ever here, along with Sri Ramana Maharshi.   
She was graced by Nayana Dheeksha from Sri Bhagawan. Its such an extraordinary  
experience to read her experience, right from her young days, when she had an  
intense desire to move to Sri Ramanashramam, how she stayed there, and how she  
had to struggle to convince her father who wanted her to lead a normal life.   
She was so close to Sri Bhagawan and ever is here!   
Salutations to Sri Ramana

Dear Nagaraj,   
Thanks. I think it was Bhagavan Ramana's best Jayanti Gift to   
that great lady. She had learnt Bhagavan Ramana's works from   
Muruganar directly, by attending classes in the Asramam. She   
had no notes with her. Several years later, she put them into   
2 volume book, in nice simple Tamil, covering the complete works   
of Bhagavan Ramana. The English translation of the first volume   
had been recently published. I do not know whether she had completed  
preparation of Volume 2. Once her parents went to   
Kanchi Sri Chandrasekara (Maha Swami) and told him that she   
preferred Sri Ramanasramam than to Kanchi Math. Mahaswami   
had said: "If she is there or here, what difference does it make?   
Both are one and the same." Then Mahaswami smiled at   
Kanakammal and said: Ekanda Vasam, Swayam baham, Anma   
Vicharam, living alone, cooking for herself and self enquiry!   
She did exactly that and got the prize of liberation on Bhagavan's   
Jayanti Day, 2010.   
Arunachala Siva.
