## Manisha Panchakam - 2

Verse 1 of Manisha Panchakam: Annamayadhannamayam athava,   
Chaitanyamena Chaitanyath,   
Dwijavara dhurikathum vaanchasi,   
Kim bruhi gaccha gacchati.   
O the best among Brahmins. This body is formed from food   
that is making up another body. So also Chaitanyam (Consciousness) comes from  
Chaitanyam. Now you are   
asking 'Go away, go away to a far off place!' Tell me   
which one should away to a far off place, from which?   
The Chandala asks Sri Sankara, whether the body made up   
of food should go farther away from another body made up   
of food, or whether the Chaitanyam, which is all pervading,   
should go away farther from another Chaitanyam?   
Consciousness or Chitanyam, is one without a second. It is all   
pervading, occupying everything in this universe. There is nothing   
other than Consciousness. There is no Space where there is   
no prevalence of Consciousness. Srimad Bhagavatam says   
that Narayana is there even in a straw as well as in big pillar.   
Sri Dakshinamurty Stotram says that only Sivam is there in   
all eight forms of five elements, sun, moon, and the jivas.   
Where can It go at all? Where is the space for It go away?   
This is the lightning like question of Chandala which struck   
Sri Sanakara.   
In the Old Hall, many devotees would ask Bhagavan Ramana: "Whether the Heart is within the body?" This is because   
Bhagavan Ramana had said that for meditators the Heart should   
be meditated upon, and this is in right side of the chest. But   
this limited description is only for the seekers and meditators.   
Once the Self is realized, the Heart contains all. The body   
is also in Heart. The Self, the Heart, is everywhere in all   
things and in all beings. When Bhagavan Ramana replied: "No, the body is in Heart" the seekers should further probe   
into the truth of His statement. Since Chaitanyam is everywhere,   
the bodies which are temporary cannot be a point of reference   
either to come near or go far. The bodies are made up of   
five elemeents. Since the five elements are also in the Consciousess, all  
bodies are in Consciousness.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Manisha Panchakakm - 3  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: November 01, 2009, 09:44:04 AM

Verse 2 of Manisha Panchakam: Kim gangambuni bhimbithe ambaramanou chaandaalavatipaya,   
Bhure chandaramsthi kanchanagati mrutumbhayorvambare,   
Pratyagvasthuni nistharange sahajanandarapodham buthou,   
Viproayam chvapachoyamitrapi mahaan koyam vibhetaprama.   
The Sun reflects on the Ganga waters and also in the gutters   
of a Chandaala. (Is there any difference?). The Space is within   
the golden pot and outside and so also is within the mudpot   
and the outside. (Is there any difference?). The Atma which   
is waveless and limitless ocean of Ananda, is ever the same!   
What is this delusion that makes you feel that difference in   
a brahmin's body and the dog eating body of Chandala?   
Sri Sankara calls the Atma as Pratyakvasthu. This is   
experienced as "I AM". This feeling of am-ness, I AM, is   
common to all living beings, as the Sun without differentiation   
reflects in the Ganga waters as well as in the gutter waters   
near the Chandala's house. The Space is again without any   
differentiation is within and outside of both golden pot and   
mudpot.   
Bhagavan Ramana used to say that I AM feeling and "I"-ness   
is more sublime than even Om. It is the feeling not connected   
with one's body or one's mind. If a leg is amputated, the I am   
feeling does not diminish. If a man becomes blind, the I am   
feeling does not diminish. If a man is sleeping, his I am feeling is no way  
absent. This Pratyakvastu is eternal, without change,   
all pervading but not specifically in one place or another.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Kartik Poornima  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: November 02, 2009, 11:57:49 AM  
---  
Today is Kartik Poornima as per lunar calendar, adopted in   
Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Today, in some temples of   
Siva, this is celebrated. I could not go this morning and I usually   
go on Monday mornings to the Skanda temple in Bangalore.   
The Kartik Poornima as per solar calendar, adopted in Tamil   
Nadu, falls on 1st December 2009. And that is on that day,   
Arunachala Hill is lighted with the lamp by the temple authorities.   
Normally the town expects a crowd of 25 lakhs people on that   
day. The Asramam booking for this day, is ruled out. Lamp   
is lighted first in Arunachaleswarar Temple and then on the Hill.   
Immediately, the Asramam lights its lamp. Graham Boyd   
will display the light as soon as the Hill is lighted in the evening.   
The webcam will show that moment of glory, for which angels   
and gods will be waiting to see.   
Last year, the Asrmam gave me permission to stay,say about   
7 days later. I and my wife rushed and saw the Light with   
our own mortal eyes for three days. The light stops on 10th   
day.   
Arunachala Siva.
