## Kartik Poornima

Today is Kartik Poornima as per lunar calendar, adopted in   
Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Today, in some temples of   
Siva, this is celebrated. I could not go this morning and I usually   
go on Monday mornings to the Skanda temple in Bangalore.   
The Kartik Poornima as per solar calendar, adopted in Tamil   
Nadu, falls on 1st December 2009. And that is on that day,   
Arunachala Hill is lighted with the lamp by the temple authorities.   
Normally the town expects a crowd of 25 lakhs people on that   
day. The Asramam booking for this day, is ruled out. Lamp   
is lighted first in Arunachaleswarar Temple and then on the Hill.   
Immediately, the Asramam lights its lamp. Graham Boyd   
will display the light as soon as the Hill is lighted in the evening.   
The webcam will show that moment of glory, for which angels   
and gods will be waiting to see.   
Last year, the Asrmam gave me permission to stay,say about   
7 days later. I and my wife rushed and saw the Light with   
our own mortal eyes for three days. The light stops on 10th   
day.   
Arunachala Siva.
