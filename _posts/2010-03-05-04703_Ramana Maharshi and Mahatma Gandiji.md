## Ramana Maharshi and Mahatma Gandiji

**On the night of January 30th, the news of Mahatma Gandhiâs death became  
known everywhere.** I heard the news at home only, because women cannot be in  
the Ashram in the nights. I went at 7-30 next morning. A prayer was being  
broadcast over the radio. The news of the death was in the newspapers, and  
Bhagavan reading it and hearing the prayer,said, âThis is the prayer of  
people who prayed like that throughout his life.â The song âVaishnava  
Janatoâ was broadcast over the radio and Bhagavan listened to it sadly. **At  
9-45, Bhagavan was about to go out when a newspaper reporter came and  
requested him to give his views on the tragedy so that they might be  
published.Bhagavan, his voice choked with emotion, said, âFor the  
Mahatmaâs death in this tragic manner, every personâs heart is mourning.  
What is there in particular that I could say? Who is there who is not grieved?  
If I say anything, you will publish it and then, one after another, people  
will come and ask me. What is the good of it?** â   
 _So saying, Bhagavan sent the reporter away and went for his walk. On his  
return, âVaishnava Janatoâ was again being broadcast and tears fell from  
Bhagavanâs eyes.At 4-30 that afternoon, all the ladies began to sing  
âRaghupati Raghava Rajaramâ.With tears in his eyes Bhagavan signed to us  
to continue. At 5 oâclock the conch shell blew and in view of the  
Mahatmaâs death a special arati (waving of lights) was offered in the  
Motherâs temple. When the sacred ash and vermilion powder were  
brought,Bhagavan took them with great reverence._   
The day before yesterday, while reading the paper,Bhagavan remarked to someone  
sitting near him, âLook, didnât a comet appear some time ago? It is  
written in this paper that the death of the Mahatma was due to that. So the  
first result of it is now over.â   
 **What exactly was in Bhagavanâs mind when he said that? Meanwhile, he took  
up another paper and on reading it,said, âThe person who fired the shot, it  
seems, came up to the Mahatma and, after bowing down, asked him, âWhy have  
you come so late today, Sir?â The Mahatma replied that it was due to some  
work. The shot was fired immediately after.â Bhagavan then drew a parallel  
from the Ramayana, saying,âIt seems that after Rama killed Ravana, he forgot  
that he,Rama, had to go to Vaikuntha. So the Devatas took counsel among  
themselves and then sent Yama, the God of Death,to him. Yama came in the garb  
of an ascetic, and respectfully said, âThe work for which you have come is  
now over; please come to heavenâ. This is similar; âSwaraj has been  
obtained; your work is over; why are you still here? Shouldnât you go back?  
It is already lateâ. Thus the Mahatma appears to have been sent away.â**   
I asked, âThe story you have just told us is from the Uttara Ramayana, is it  
not?â   
Bhagavan: âYes, but not only there. It has been written in another book  
that, in the case of Krishna, the arrow of Vyadha was the cause of His death;  
similarly it happened with the Mahatma.â   
 **Yesterday, Harindranath Chattopadhyaya showed a photo of Mahatma, and said,  
âIt is a pity that there was never any meeting between Gandhi and  
Bhagavan.â**   
 **Bhagavan: âSome time ago, he came to Tiruvannamalai.A meeting had been  
arranged for him to be held on the road around the hill, beyond the Ashram.  
People here thought that he would come to the Ashram on his way back, but  
owing to the pressure of the crowds it was impossible, and he went away direct  
to the station. It seems that he very much regretted this afterwards.**  
Shankarlal Banker was very keen on bringing him here, and in 1938, when  
Rajendra Prasad and Jamnalal Bajaj came here and saw Skandasramam, they wanted  
to induce the Mahatma to stay there for some time.But it did not happen. **If  
at Sabarmati, or at Wardha anyone said that he was mentally depressed, the  
Mahatma used to say, âGo to Ramanasramam and come back after a monthâs  
stay thereâ.** _When Ramaswami Reddiar went to see the Mahatma immediately  
after taking office as Chief Minister, Madras State,the Mahatma, it seems,  
asked him for how long he had been going to the Ramanasramam. When he answered  
that he had been going there for over thirty years, the Mahatma said, âIs  
that so? I have tried thrice, but so far have not been able to go thereâ.  
What could he do? How could he come here when he was not left alone for one  
moment?â_   
 **Bhagavan read in todayâs paper a report to the effect that the Mahatma  
had had from a dream the night before the tragedy, a premonition of his death,  
and that therefore,he had quickly disposed of his papers which had caused the  
delay in his coming to the prayer. Bhagavan commented, âYes. For enlightened  
people, will there not be that much of premonition? They will know, but will  
not tell others.â**

Dear prasanth,   
Mahatma Gandhi had come to Tiruvannamalai and also to Madurai once each, but   
he never met Bhagavan Ramana. C. Rajagopalachari, the die-hard qualified non-   
dualist effectively prevented Mahatma meeting Him. But C.R as a Chief  
Minister]   
of Madras State, came to inaugurate the Patala Lingam shrine, as per the  
invitation   
of Talyarkhan, in 1949. But he did not make even a courtesy call to Bhagavan  
Ramana.   
In 1952, he came again to Tiruvannamalai and also to the Asramam. He was very   
much pleased with the exquisite sculpture of Sri Dakshinamurthy at Mother's   
Temple, and then called the Sthapathi to Madras to build the Gandhi Mantapam   
there in Adyar.   
Arunachala Siva.

C. Rajagopalachari is known for his keen intellect. He has even read  
Tirukural at a   
late age and wrote excellent commentary on that book. But keen intellect  
alone   
is not adequate to change one's basic faith in Sri Vaishnavism or Saivism.  
One should   
yearn for non dual consciousness and one should look for a person who is the   
embodiment of non dual consciousness.   
Arunachala Siva.

Today Wed 2 Oct 2013 is Gandhi Jayanthi and though Bhagavan and Gandhi never  
met each other they admired each other and Bhagavan even wept when Gandhi was  
assassinated.

Raghupati Raghav Raja Ram is a popular bhajan (Hindu devotional song) that was  
a favorite of Mahatma Gandhi. The version that is most common was put to music  
by Vishnu Digambar Paluskar, and was sung by Gandhi and his followers as they  
walked during the 241 mile Salt March to Dandi.

I dont have spiritually high opinion on both these personalities The Father  
of the Nation and Rajaji.   
Bhagavan Ramana knows in and out of any person's core mind-- that is why  
Maharishee declined to give his real comments to that reporter when asked for.   
Maharishee was also aware of what times he is living, and these type of  
'public' wave will be simply endorsed by great saints.   
I can only re-call how Smt. Indhira Gandhi met Ananadamayi Ma and Sri Rajiv  
Gandhi met along with his wife, Kanchi Paramacharya.   
These eminenent politicians including Mahatma Gandhiji were simply diplomats  
and politicians.   
They used religion for mass appeal and change of power.   
They were not interested in the least in enlightenement.   
A king should renounce if he wants Self Knowledge. He may be a gun powder but  
only that he is soaking the gun powder in cold water of politics.   
A politician's life was not beyond criticism. One can tell stories and  
stories. God bless.
