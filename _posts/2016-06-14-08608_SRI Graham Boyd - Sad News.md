## Sri Ramana Satsang possibility in Tirunelveli  
Author: ramesh.aba          Date: June 04, 2016, 11:06:34 AM

I paln to visit Tirunelveli for few weeks / months.   
Would like to know if there are any Sri Ramana Satsang at Tirunelveli? The  
URL http://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/centres/directory/ has more centres  
listed in the US than in India.   
Even a meditation environment similar to the one at Sri Ramanasramam of  
Tiruvannamalai would help Sri Ramana's devotees across India.

## Topic: Mindful Centering & Zen Facing  
Author: sam cope            Date: June 14, 2016, 01:24:17 AM

**Mindful Centering:**   
Take a thought. Any thought...as a centering thought.   
It could be...'who am I'? It could be...'to whom has this thought arisen' it  
could be... 'blueberry muffins'   
Think this thought.   
If other thoughts arise...   
do not pursue them.   
After each one arises...   
think the centering thought.   
It does not matter how many thoughts arise.   
Mindful Centering is a form of raja yoga that utilizes a centering thought to  
still in being. In Zen facing, the state of love is totally complete and is  
the real center. The climax resulting from the energy of mutual presence and  
control from mindful centering can create a stable meeting in bliss..One then  
only has to think the centering thought when it feels right   
 **Zen Facing:**   
Two beings consciously meet in their human presence and mindfully center. Once  
the thought control of Mindful centering is mutually understood, in zen  
facing, one only has to think the centering thought when it feels right. When  
ready, eye contact is held.

Inquiry **IS SO** beautiful   
... it introduces the mind to stillness.   
But Inquiry alone does not grow strength of mind. Mind remains in its natural  
fickle weakness.   
Bhagavan pointed to the the company of the wise for strength.   
And, the concentration on a single thought.   
Talk 371: "Dhyana is holding on to a single thought and putting off all other  
thoughts. It is the msot intense and potent of all. No other effort is  
necessary."   
talk191 : "3) Concentration upon one thought make all other thoughts  
dissappear"   
talk 427: "The degree of freedom from unwanted thoughts and the degree of  
concentration on a single thought are the measure to gauge spiritual  
progress."   
Zen facing is the culmination of mind control, centering with a single thought  
and spiritual company for strengthening mind to the highest states.

Quote from Sri Ravi: Quote  
> It just recalled to my mind what Sri Aurobindo once said:"No one can write  
> about my life because it has not been on the surface for man to see".   
> This can be said about the inner spiritual being in every earnest

I love this thought,and find it quite beautiful and truthful. Inner life is  
most important of all,and no one can say with any certainty what happens in  
someone's heart and soul. Sure,it can be sensed from some gestures and  
similar,like Sri Ravi said,from that sensitivity and compassion. But it  
needs,also, very sensitive and perspicacious eye to see all this. Our heart  
and being has a much greater depth and richness,that even we ourselves cannot  
know it completely. It is known to itself only...   
About meditation (from Mr Dennis Hartel's letter),well,meditation does not  
need to include certain posture,or spending time on some particular place with  
lots of people. I remember Sri Graham posts about his severe exercises for  
concentration,and talk of many hours spent in practice of selfenquiry. The  
real meditation is actually abidance,and it can and should be done all through  
the day. We could look at this person and could not at all discern he is  
meditating.   
I believe it all comes in phases,and every period of time brings a little  
different approach.   
When i think about it,i came to see that mind should not be brought to the  
point it begins to do some things automatically,and to made them just a  
habitual routine. Every practice,or meditation should be done with total  
absorbtion. Otherwise,it learns to camouflage itself very well...   
Quote  
> it is this inner fire that is paramount and Graham had this in a great

I also saw him in this way...   
And many thanks dear Sri Balaji for posting Sri Graham's picture!

Quote from Sri Ravi: Quote

> about my life because it has not been on the surface for man to see".

I love this thought,and find it quite beautiful and truthful. Inner life is  
most important of all,and no one can say with any certainty what happens in  
someone's heart and soul. Sure,it can be sensed from some gestures and  
similar,like Sri Ravi said,from that sensitivity and compassion. But it  
needs,also, very sensitive and perspicacious eye to see all this. Our heart  
and being has a much greater depth and richness,that even we ourselves cannot  
know it completely. It is known to itself only...   
About meditation (from Mr Dennis Hartel's letter),well,meditation does not  
need to include certain posture,or spending time on some particular place with  
lots of people. I remember Sri Graham posts about his severe exercises for  
concentration,and talk of many hours spent in practice of selfenquiry. The  
real meditation is actually abidance,and it can and should be done all through  
the day. We could look at this person and could not at all discern he is  
meditating.   
I believe it all comes in phases,and every period of time brings a little  
different approach.   
When i think about it,i came to see that mind should not be brought to the  
point it begins to do some things automatically,and to made them just a  
habitual routine. Every practice,or meditation should be done with total  
absorbtion. Otherwise,it learns to camouflage itself very well...   
Quote  
> it is this inner fire that is paramount and Graham had this in a great  
> measure. ...and this is the true 'Graham'.  
I also saw him in this way...   
And many thanks dear Sri Balaji for posting Sri Graham's picture!   
With love,

Dear Candice,   
Came upon the sad news only today. Also read the article on Graham in "The  
Maharshi."   
Please accept my heartfelt condolences.

Dear Candice,   
I am very sad to hear the news of Sri.Graham.I came to Bhagavan Ramana  
Maharshi a few years back and read a lot about his teachings from this forum.I  
am indebted to your father for this.I have also suggested this forum to many  
earnest seekers.   
Sri.Graham will be in our hearts as long as we will live.I also thank you very  
much for taking up the responsibility to manage the forum.   
Deva Kumar.K
