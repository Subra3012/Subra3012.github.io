## Email addresses

I recently sent two email messages to all members. Many were returned because  
the addresses were non-existent. The majority of those accounts have now been  
deleted because there is no way of contacting the member.   
The accounts of active members whose emails bounced have not been deleted. So  
if you are an active member then please ensure that your email address is  
correct.   
Email verification has now been enabled for those registering for the first  
time or re-registering.

My dear Graham, My e mail address is: g337h4@yahoo.com.   
But, Sir, I had a different problem for the past 15 days. My   
computer broke down and it took 2 weeks to set right and today only   
it became alright. I case I have not received your e mail, I shall send   
you a communication. Thanking you,   
Yours truly,   
Subramanian. R
