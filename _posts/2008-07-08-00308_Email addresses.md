On 21st March, 2009, Sri K. Natesan, who had been bed-ridden   
for the past year, was absorbed in Arunachala in his 95th year.   
He had been residing in the house of his brother Sri Chandrasekharan,   
in Tiruvannamalai and passed away in front of the Asramam gates   
while being taken for medical treatment. He was a devotee of Bhagavan Ramana  
and had stayed in the Asramam during Bhagavan's days and thereafter.   
Over many decades, he loving collected and preserved the manuscripts of Sri  
Ganapati Muni, to whom he was greatly devoted,   
and was instrumental in their publication of Vasishta Ganapti Muni's Collected  
Works. The Eleventh Miscellaneous Writings, was released   
before Sri Bhagavan's Samadhi on 23rd February 2009, Maha Sivaratri Day.   
There is one more volume yet to be completed that contains of a   
complete index of the previous eleven volumes. Sri K. Natesan,   
had been unable to attend the function due to the infirmities of old   
age but felt that with the release of this volume, his life's mission   
was complete.

I recently sent two email messages to all members. Many were returned because  
the addresses were non-existent. The majority of those accounts have now been  
deleted because there is no way of contacting the member.   
The accounts of active members whose emails bounced have not been deleted. So  
if you are an active member then please ensure that your email address is  
correct.   
Email verification has now been enabled for those registering for the first  
time or re-registering.
