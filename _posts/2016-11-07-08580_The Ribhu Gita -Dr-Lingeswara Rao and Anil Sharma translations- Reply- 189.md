23\. Not this, not this, ever not this. Neither you, nor I' \- meditate thus.  
All is Brahman   
\- there is no doubt of this. All knowledge is naught.   
24. Everything is a fabricated structure of your words and meanings. The fear of   
all the worlds is naught. All the holy waters are not true; neither are all  
the temples.   
25. All being consciousness, the name all never exists.   
Forsaking all forms of the certitude 'all is Brahman.'   
26\. Brahman is all and its reality. The world and its phenomena do not  
exist. Renounce the remebrance of the phenomenal and take hold of the  
recollection   
of Brahman.   
27. Thereafter forsaking even that be established in your own state. Renouncing   
the stable state be the Self alone.   
28\. Renouncing even the renunciation, ever forsake the idea of  
differentiation.   
Being enveloped by yourself, attain yourself by yourself.   
30. 'All' is the thought. There is no doubt of this. 'All' is naught. There is no doubt   
of this. 'All' is trifling. There is no doubt of this. 'All' is illusion.  
There is no doubt of   
this.   
29. What the finger points out as 'this' is only lifeless being dead. This saying is to be   
perceived through the sacred writings and utterances.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
