**Brahman beyond speech & thought: (Anuvaga 4 of Anandavalli)**   
When all words turn back as well as Manas, without reaching; he who knows  
Brahman's bliss fears not at any time. There of -of the former- this one  
verily is the self-embodied. Than that verily, than this one formed of Manas -  
there is another self within; formed of Vijnana. By him this one is filled.  
(The inner self of Manomaya is Vijnanamaya). He verily this one, is quite of  
man's shape. After his human shape, this one is of man's shape.   
**Of him, faith surely is the head, righteousness is the right wing, truth is  
the left wing, yoga is the self and Mahah is the tail, the support. On that as  
well there is this verse.**   
 **Note** : Even though we get pains in our body it is not body that feels  
pain but it is mind that feels pain.That is the reason why doctors give  
anestisa to escape from pain.   
 **Contemplation of Vijnana as the Hiranyagaryabha: (Anuvaga 5 of Anandavalli)**   
Intelligence accomplishes sacrifice and deeds as well does it accomplish.  
Intelligence do all Gods worship as Brahman, the eldest. If intelligence as  
Brahman, one knows if from that he swerves not, in body sins forsaking, he all  
desires achieves. There of - of all the former, this one is the self-embodied.  
Than that verily, than this one formed of Vijnana- there is another self  
within; formed of bliss. By him this one is filled. He verily this one, is  
quite of man's shape. After his human shape, this one is of man's shape. **Of  
him, love itself is the head, joy is the right wing, delight is the left wing,  
bliss is the self and Brahman is the tail, the support.** On that, too, there  
is this verse.   
 **Note** : **Sri Sundara chaitanya Swami says sankalpas/vikalpas are done by  
mind but decided by buddi i.e intelligence vignanamaya kosam.   
Decision was done by Intelligence i.e vignanamaya kosam.   
So karta is intellect and not mind as we thought in previous verse.**   
So here we naturally think we are intellect.   
Mind,body are instruments only.   
 **Suppose we go into a hotel then mind will show all its fav choices to eat  
before intellect like idly,vada etc.Then finally intellect will take decision  
and will select one tiffen to eat.   
So decision is taken by vignanamaya kosam.But body decision is also important  
as suppose our body donot have teeth then intellect should change the decision  
of eating breakfast as few items cannot be taken without teeth.**   
So aham vritti(EGO) is vignanamaya kosam and other thoughts are dependent on  
this aham vritti.   
Sraddha is important for disciple to succeed in devotion.   
 **Brahman - the One being: (Anuvaga 6 of Anandavalli)**   
Non- being, verily, does one become if he as non-being knows Brahman. If one  
knows that Brahman is, then they regard him as being. Thus reads the verse.  
There of - of the former, this one is the self-embodied. Hence, then, the  
questions that follow: whether does any one who knows nor, departing, goes to  
that region? Or does any one who knows, departing attain that region. He  
desired: many may I be, may I be born; He made Tapas; Having made Tapas. He  
sent forth all this and that of this more. This having sent forthwith, into  
that very thing, He then entered. That having entered, both the being and the  
beyond, He became the definite and the indefinite, the abode and the non-  
abode, the conscious and the unconscious, both the real and the false, did the  
Real become, and whatever else is here. That they say, is the Real.   
 **Note** : **Sri Sundara chaitanya Swami** says In Deep sleep we are infact  
happy as told by Ramana Maharshi.   
 **Because there is happiness every living being likes to sleep and even  
prepares his bed so carefully to sleep.   
And also there is no need to tell anyone to sleep as automatically we will  
sleep if required.But no one really wants to getup from sleep as we donot want  
to lose happiness.**   
 **He said One god in world first created few things in the world and then  
started thinking what to do next in next consecutive days which is funny.**   
 **Brahman - as external objects: (Anuvaga 7 of Anandavalli)**   
Non being verily, this was in the beginning. Then indeed, the being was born;  
that created itself by itself. Then that the Self cause is called. That one  
called the Self cause, He is the flavour. Flavour indeed, this one having got,  
blessed becomes he. Who indeed could live, who breathe, should not this bliss  
be in akasa; this it is that bestows bliss. When in truth this (soul) gains  
fearless support in Him who is invisible, selfless, undefined, non-abode then  
has he the fearless reached. When indeed this (soul) makes in this one even  
the smallest break, then for him, there is fear. That verily, is fear to the  
knower who does not reflect. On that, too, there is this verse.   
 **Note** : **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says happiness is our nature and it  
cannot be found in external objects.If really happiness is found outside in  
then it will become jadam i.e insentient.**   
 **He says yoga school is ok till some extent to get concentration of mind and  
also for body maintenence but cannot be useful to reach our goal.**   
 **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says without effort we will get happiness in  
deep sleep.So happiness is not dependent on outside external objects.**   
 **Who attains Brahman?   
(Anuvaga 8 of Anandavalli)**   
 **From fear of Him does Wind blow, from fear of Him does Sun rise, from fear  
of Him, Agni and Indra (act) and death the fifth does run. Now, this is the  
enquiry concerning bliss.**   
 **Suppose a youth, a good youth, learned in the sacred love, promptest in  
action, steadiest in heart, strongest in body - suppose his is all this earth,  
full of wealth. This is one human bliss.**   
What is a hundred times the human bliss, that is one bliss of the human  
fairies, as also of the man versed in the Vedas, not smitten by passion.   
What is a hundred times the bliss of the human fairies, that is one bliss of  
the celestial fairies, as also of the man versed in the Vedas, not smitten by  
passion.   
What is a hundred times the bliss of the celestial fairies, that is one bliss  
of the Pitris, who dwell in the long-enduring world, as also of the man versed  
in the Vedas, not smitten by passion.   
What is a hundred times the bliss of the Pitris, who dwell in the long-  
enduring world, that is one bliss of the Devas born in the Ajana, as also of  
the man versed in the Vedas, not smitten by passion.   
What is a hundred times the bliss of the Devas born in the Ajana, that is one  
bliss of the Devas (known as) Karma-Devas, those who have reached Devas by  
work, as also of the man versed in the Vedas, not smitten by passion.   
What is a hundred times the bliss of the Karma - Devas, that is one bliss of  
the Devas, as also of the man versed in the Vedas, not smitten by passion.  
(Note: Here, "Devas" connotes the 33 Devas [8 vasus; 11 rudras; 12 adityas;  
Indra and Prajapathi]- who have a right to partake the oblations offered in  
the sacrificial rites)   
What is a hundred times the bliss of the Devas, that is one bliss of Indra, as  
also of the man versed in the Vedas, not smitten by passion. (Note: Indra is  
the Lord of Devas)   
What is a hundred times the bliss of Indra, that is one bliss of Brihaspathi  
(Indra's teacher), as also of the man versed in the Vedas, not smitten by  
passion.   
What is a hundred times the bliss of Brihaspathi, that is one bliss of  
Prajapathi (the Lord of creatures, is the viraj, who has the three worlds for  
his body), as also of the man versed in the Vedas, not smitten by passion.   
What is a hundred times the bliss of Prajapathi, that is one bliss of Brahma,  
as also of the man versed in the Vedas, not smitten by passion.   
 **Note** : **Sri Sundara chaitanya Swami says In anandamaya kosam there is no  
karta and only bhokta hence there is absolute happiness.**   
 **In deep sleep happiness which we gain has no reason where as happiness we  
gain in dreams and waking states have some reason for our happiness.   
Example: we get happiness if we eat gulab jam etc but in deep sleep there is  
no reason as it is our natural state.  
**Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says god and creation is not different as he  
himself thought of becoming many and hence came creation.   
So as adi sankara said world is false and brahman is true and world is  
brahman.**   
 **Sri Sundara chaitanya Swami says man is not born due to papam but only due  
to previous janma punyam only.In one religion it is told that man is born with  
a sin. He says if that is the case then everywork he does will also become sin  
as it is sinner who is doing the karma.**   
 **He says when ramana maharshi comes even lord indra shoukd even stand and  
respect him.Such is the power of ramana maharshi.**   
 **Anandamaya Kosa described:**   
Brahma means - Hiranyagarbha, who is manifested as the universal being as well  
as the individual beings who pervades all the universe of Samsara in whom all  
bliss unite into one, who possess Dharma which causes that bliss, the  
knowledge concerning Dharma and its results, as also the utmost freedom from  
desire.   
And this one, who is in the man, and that one who is in the Sun, He is one. He  
who knows departing from this world, attains this Annamaya self; this  
Pranamaya self does he attain; this Manomaya self he attains; this Vijnanamaya  
self he attains; he attains this Anandamaya Self. On that, too, there is this  
verse.   
 **Note** : **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says in one religion it says that  
god created the sun on 5th day and he criticised and said that how can we know  
4 days have passed when sun itself is created on 5th day.   
He said it is shame on humanity to write those kind of holy texts.**   
 **Sri Sundara Chaitanya swami says happiness cannot be retrieved by even  
mixture of combination of sense object + mind + indriyas combination.   
He said there is one school who believes that the above combination gives  
perfect happiness.   
That particular school gives example of killi in which the leaf is in green  
colour and sunnam is in white colour and vokkapodi is in brown colour.But  
finally when we mix those we will get red colour.So that school similarly we  
get perfect happiness in a mixture of combination of sense object + mind +  
indriyas combination.   
However sri sundara chaitanya swami does not agree with above argument and  
says darkness(sense objects) + darkness(mind) + darkness(indriyas) cannot  
bring light.**   
 **Brahman is beyond speech and thought: (Anuvaga 9 of Anandavalli)**   
He who knows the bliss of Brahman when all words recede, as well as mind,  
without reaching, he is not afraid of any one whatsoever. Him, verily, the  
thought not burns, why I have not done the right? Why have I done sin? Who so  
knows thus, these two as the self does he cherish. Both these, verily as the  
self does he cherish who thus knows. Such is the sacred wisdom.   
 **Peace Chants:**   
May Brahman protect us (the Guru and Sishya) both!   
May he give us both to enjoy!   
Efficiency may we both attain!   
Effective may our study prove!   
Hate may we not (each other) at all!

Dear prasanth,   
Nice description.   
 That Brahman exists as the cause of fear and fearlessness,   
of the men of ignorance and knowledge. For fearlessness comes   
as a result of taking refuge in something that exists. Whereas fear cannot  
cease by resorting to something that does not exist. Therefore Brahman causes  
fearlessness since there is nothing other than that in this nondual universe.  
Hence a Brahmavit also does not have fear since he is Brahman and there is  
nothing else other than   
him.   
Jnanam alone can give fearlessness. Jnanam is another name for   
Brahman. The Jnanam cleans up the ignorance, which gives room   
for fear, because ignorance seeks the support of things which are   
ephemeral. Like wealth, health, wife, son, land and gold. A Jnani   
without any of these, is fearless because he is Jnanam. He knows   
that all the ephemeral things take birth in Brahman, lives in Brahman and  
dissolves in Brahman.   
Bhagavan Ramana says this in Verse 2 of Sri Arunachala Pancharatnam: As on a screen, a wondrous picture,   
On You, fair Hill, is all this world,   
Formed, sustained, and then withdrawn,   
Ever as 'I' in the Heart you dance,   
Hence You are called the Heart.   
Arunachala Siva.
