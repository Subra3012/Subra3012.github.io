A few days back Ramanaduli mentioned about some siddhas   
whom are less known like Gunangudi Mastan Swamigal.   
Yesterday, I was listening to the songs titled Paripoorana   
Panchamirtam, containing 5 melodious songs under five   
types of abhishekams for Murugan -- like milk, curd, ghee,   
sugar and honey.   
Sri Pampan Swamigal was born in Pampan, a village   
on the southernmost tip of India near Kanyakumari.   
He was the son of one Sathappa Pillai. His name was   
Appavu. He was taught classical Tamil by one Muniyandi   
Pillai, a versatile Tamil pandit. One day, when he went to   
the Siva temple of Ramanathapuam, he desired to write   
poems on Muruga and the impulse became a reality immediately. He could compose  
songs on Muruga. He wrote   
them afterwards and kept with him. One day one Sethu Madhava Iyer of  
Rameswaram happened to read these poems   
and became quite excited. He took Appavu and gave him   
the six lettered mantra of Muruga as Upadesa. He also got   
him married later to a good lady.   
Soon Appavu Pillai started performing miralces for good   
purpose, like curing illness etc., He also composed many   
songs on Muruga. He wrote this Paripoorana Panchamirtam   
in 1891. After visiting many Murga temples, Appavu Pillai   
took to sannyasa and reached Madras. He then went to Kasi   
in the year 1902 and meditated on Visalakshi and Viswanatha. He returned to  
Madras and after visiting Chidambaram he decided to stay only in Madras. He  
wrote the famous   
Sri Kumarastavam in 1915. But as per the call of Arunachaleswara, he went to  
Tiruvannamalai and from there he went to Bangalore. He attained Maha Samadhi  
on 30.5.1929, in   
Tiruvanmiyur, on the outskirts of today's Chennai. His   
Samadhi is said to be in Tiruvanmiyur, Chennai.   
His various songs have been classified into six books.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
I am very fortunate to live very near to Pamban swamigal temple. Lord Muruga  
gave darshan to swamigal when His legs got fractured when he was walking on  
the road thampuchetti road. He was admitted in Rayapettai hospital. Lying on  
bed He started singing on Muruga. At the time two peacocks came and sat on the  
window in his bed room. And started dancing. That time He could see a small  
child was lying beside Him. He felf some light fell on his ankle which got  
fractured.   
After this incident doctors came and found there is no sign of fracture. They  
realised His power. Till to day that room was kept clean. People go without  
shoes.   
This incident became a festival now. Even in Pambu panchangam it is written  
MYURA SEVAI. Devotees are coming in thousand to the temple. His body was kept  
in the temple. And they built like chidambaram top portion. No archana only  
pradhakshnam. But there is a small Murugan sannathi there where regular pujas  
are being done. On full moon day, lots and lots of people come and stay over  
night. people say if you come 3 full moon day, your wishes will be fullfilled.  
I stayed once. Swamigal wrote more than 4000 poems. Still His songs are being  
talked among ILLAKIYAVADHIGAL. They say it is very difficult to understand the  
meaning for some of his poems. During the world tamil conference they give  
lectures on His poems. In every sivalaya in chennai we can see His  
kumarastham.   
He did miracles after His samadhi. His accident took place in 1923 december  
27.   
His shanmukakavacam is very famous one. Whenever Swamigal got problem He used  
sing this Shankukakavacam. During 1946, Shanmukam pillai who was working   
in Begalore government office got found some punishment where He did not do  
any mistake. One of his friends Mr. S.M.Shanmukam pillai who was working in   
chennai telegraph office, told to chant Swamigal's Shanmuka kavacham. So in  
Begalore he started chanting. Onthat day in court, he was announced that he is   
not guilty. But Shanmukam was standing in the counter and chanting this  
kavacham. At that time his chennai friend came and brought him out of the  
court andtold you are free now. The case was withdrawn because you are guilty.  
Shanmukam felt free and told him thank you/ But his friend was that time in  
chennai   
only where he never left chennai. So Swamigal came in disguise as his friend,.  
Now also people get many experiences.   
Thanks to Swamigal. He made me to write His story to this forum. ELLA PUGAZHUM

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Thanks for more information about Pampan Swamigal.   
He was a great Siddha, who had vision of Muruga on many   
occasions. His Kumara Stavam is quite famous. His Pahi   
Kadithal, Shanmuga Kavacham are also nice. His Paripoona   
Panchamirtam, is quite tough to read and tougher to sing!   
Someone has sung it in Bangalore, and my wife who attends   
Bhajans is learning it. The song when properly sung, is   
ecstatic! I learnt the meanings through another book. The   
meaning for the five songs are also quite interesting. There   
is one song, where every god is dancing with Murugan. I shall   
try to give the meaning of this particular song shortly.   
You need a very large canvas, like the Last Supper of Lenoardo   
Da Vinci, to picturise the various gods who are dancing.   
Arunachala Siva.
