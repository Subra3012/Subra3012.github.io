## God's creation

A person was idly sitting under an apple tree enjoying the nature and  
surroundings.   
His eyes fell on a huge pumpkin on a pumpkin creeper in a nearby bush.   
He thought: "Such a huge apple tree is having so small a fruit and a frail  
pumpkin creeper is overburdened with a huge fruit (vegetable). God's creation  
does not seem to match proportions."   
Suddenly an apple fell on him and he was a little hurt.   
He realized: "It is because of smallness of apples that I am only a little  
hurt; had pumpkins grown on apple trees and had fallen on me, what would have  
happened to me? God surely understands what he does."

Dear silentgreen,   
Every one of God's creation has a purpose and a meaning. Even   
mosquitoes and bed bugs have some meaning in their creation.   
We do not know 'what for' about many of them.   
Arunachala Siva.

The aim and purpose of human life is self realization. Yet only a very few  
have this conviction. Even among them ony a few are determined in it.

Dear S. Subramanian,   
Yes. Very true. But this interest in liberation, or self realization   
is not had by all. Many poor wants to become rich in the next   
birth. Many rich wants to have sicknesss free health in next   
birth. Many a child less couple want to have a child in next   
birth. The not so beautiful wants beauty. The desires are endless.   
Desire for the Self is quite rare. That is why, Sri Sankara says   
in Vivekachudmani, one should have mumukshatvam as the first   
requisite. Leaving all that have been told above, one should have   
serious desire to attain the Self. For this, Sri Sankara says mumukshatvam is  
nothing but throwing away the ego through   
vicharam. The best aid is bhakti. What is bhakti? Bhakti is   
atma-anusanthanam. He also says for this moksham, sraddha, bhakti, dhyana and  
yoga are auxillaries.   
Arunachala Siva.**
