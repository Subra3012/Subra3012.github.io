Mind and Self Realization: For such higher Self Realization, the mind plays a crucial role. The mind can  
be the instrument for either   
bondage or liberation, ignorance or enlightenment. If we turn the mind  
towards external world as the   
reality, it becomes a force of attachment and sorrow. if we turn the mind  
within to the Inner Being as   
the Reality, it slows down and comes to reflect that higher reality. The mind  
becomes a mirror for the   
light of the Self to shine.   
So turning the mind within is the essence of Yoga and meditation. For this  
mind must first be brought   
to a one pointed state. A fragmented or distracted mind cannot turn within.  
The inward turning process   
can be looked upon very simply as immersing the mind in the deeper  
consciousness of the inner Being   
that dwells within the Heart.   
The mind's knowledge is conceptual or thought based. It results in facts,  
data, information, ideals,theories,   
opinions, concepts or formulas. Our inner Being has a higher kind of  
knowledge, which is radically different   
from what the mind can know. Our inner Being has a special 'knowledge by  
identity', which is not colored   
by thought and its preconceptions.   
Through one's inner Being, one can merge into the Inner Being of all that one  
comes in contact with   
through the body and senses. For most of us, this is a very difficult  
condition to imagine. But whenever   
the mind becomes totally concentrated, it experiences a quantum leap in  
awareness and a special knowledge   
arises through inner unity of the seer and the seen. This inner knowledge  
through identity is the real   
yogic knowledge that frees us from all bondage of the Being, which arises  
through pure consciousness   
when mental activity comes to rest, when the mind becomes cool, calm and  
silent.
