15. I am attribute-less. I am part-less. I am the existent. I am the sustainer.   
I am god. I abound in material wealth. I am pure. I am devoid of anything.   
16. I am the essence. I am devoid of essence. I am the fourth state. I am the   
auspicious thought. I am desire. I am devoid of action. I am the eternal  
and   
pure form.   
17. I am devoid of the fruits of rituals. I am Brahman alone. All this is supreme   
Brahman. This is the Self. There is no wonder in this.   
18. The nature of the Self is complete and incomplete; ever the embodiment of the   
Self of all. The nature of the Self is paramount Bliss without any  
limitations whatsoever.   
19\. 'I am the Self alone that is unitary and taint-less nature.' contemplate  
thus associated with I-am-ness, combined with 'I am' feeling.   
20\. See the Self of all as peace. The idea of peace is an impurity of the  
mind.   
Renouncing 'I am the body' thought, be of the conviction 'I am Brahman.'   
21. I am indeed Brahman, just Brahman and nothing in the least other than   
Brahman. 'I am not this, I am not this, I am not this' \- remember thus ever.   
22. "I am He. I am He. I am Brahman" -contemplate thus. 'Consciousness am I,   
Consciousness am I, Brahman. Consciousness am I, Consciousness am I' \-  
proclaim   
thus.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.
