'In the recesses of the lotus shaped heart of all, from Vishnu downwards,  
there shines as Absolute   
Consciousness the Paramatman (Supreme Spirit) who is the same as Arunachala or  
Ramana. When   
the mind melts with love of Him and reaches the inmost recess of the Heart  
wherein He abides as the   
Beloved, the subtle eye of Absolute Consciousness opens and He reveals Himself  
as pure Knowledge.'   
(The Collected Works of Sri Ramana Maharshi, 'Arunachala Ramana'.   
Sri Ramana said in regard to where the Heart is located, 'The Heart is used in  
the Vedas and the scriptures   
to denote the place whence the notion 'I' springs. Does it spring only from  
the fleshy ball? It springs within   
us something right in the middle of our being. The 'I' has no location.  
Everything is the Self. There is nothing but that. So the Heart must be said  
to be the entire body of oneself and of the entire universe, conceived as 'I'.  
But to help the spiritual practiser, one has to indicate a definite part of  
the universe, or   
of the physical body. So the Heart is pointed out as the seat of the Self.  
But in truth we are everywhere,   
we are all that is, and there is nothing else. (Talks, Op.cit Talks $ 29)/   
Again, regarding the location of the Heart: "The Heart is not physical.  
Meditation should not be on the right   
or left. Meditation should be possible on the Self. Everyone knows 'I am'.  
Who is the 'I'? It will be   
neither within or without, neither on the right nor on the left. 'I am' \-  
that is all. The Heart is the center   
from which everything springs. Because you see the world, the body and so on,  
it is said that there is a   
center for these, which is called the Heart. When you are in the Heart, the  
Heart is known to be neither   
the center nor the circumference. There is nothing else. Whose center could  
it be? (Talks $ 273).   
concluded.   
Arunachala Siva.
