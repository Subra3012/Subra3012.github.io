Auvaiyar's aathichoodi is one of the best and most simple teachings for  
humanity for simple devout and even for highly educated people. they explain  
the basic wisdom to be cultivated by each one of us. I like Auvaiyar for her  
simplicity and her emotional devotion towards Murugan.   
ஆத்திசூடி   
அறம் செய விரும்பு Be desirous of doing virtue   
ஆறுவது சினம் It is the nature of anger to temper in time   
இயல்வது கரவேல் Never stop learning   
ஈவது விலக்கேல் Don't prevent charity (Always be charitable)   
உடையது விளம்பேல் Avoid words that could hurt ( Don't boast of your  
possessions)   
ஊக்கமது கைவிடேல் Don't give up perseverance   
எண் எழுத்து இகழேல் Don't despise learning   
ஏற்பது இகழ்ச்சி Acceptance (begging alms) is despicable   
ஐயமிட்டுண் Eat after donating (to the needy)   
ஒப்புர வொழுகு Act virtuously   
ஓதுவது ஒழியேல் Don't give up reading (scriptures)   
ஒளவியம் பேசேல் Don't carry tales

Dear Nagaraj,   
Excellent. Avvaiyar is known for her simplicity and direct teachings.   
She starts Aathichoodi with prayer song on Siva.   
O the One wearing aathi flowers, and a young moon,   
Who is ever silent and a white body with holy ashes...!   
Arunachala Siva.
