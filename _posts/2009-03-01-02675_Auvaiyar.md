## Uma making fun of Siva  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 01, 2009, 08:16:30 AM

Once Uma told Siva proudly: " I am Narayana's sister. See his glory.   
But what glory have you got? Narayana selected you as my husband   
and I do not know why?' Siva smiled.   
Uma then asked: "You are wearing dangerous serpents all over your body. I am  
shivering with fear and I do not like this."   
Siva said: "You are talking like this. Your brother is lying on a big  
serpent, Adisesha and Lakshmi is not afraid. How come?"   
Uma then continued: "You go to every house and beg. Look at the riches of my  
brother!"   
Siva said: "O don't tell me. I go only to those who give me with full heart.  
Did not your brother go to Vidhura and take cold gruel?"   
Uma then said: "You are bluff-master. You lied to Siruthondar saying that  
you wanted fresh human flesh. You lied to Kannappa with a false eye injury."   
Siva said: " O You are talking about my bluffs. Your brother is only a grand  
master in bluffs. In Mahabharata war, he uttered several lies.   
He even lied to Yasoda saying that he did not eat sand."   
Uma said: "You got nice beatings from Varaguna Pandya."   
Siva said: "Anyway, was it not better than the beating that your brother got  
from Yasoda, the cowherdess?"   
Uma said: "You say you are an ascetic. But you stole the chastity of   
8000 married women in Daruka forest."   
Siva said: "O You are talking about that. But what about your brother who  
enjoyed 16000 married women, the gopikas in Brindavan!"   
After this the green creeper like emerald queen Uma decided not to leave the  
Ruby like king Siva and became part of his body.   
This is the poem by Saint Poet, Sivaprakasa Swamigal, on Arunachaleswara.

## O Rama why are you now holding bow and arrow?  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 01, 2009, 08:23:53 AM

Veeraraghava Mudaliar was born near Madurantakam, a Vishnu pilgrim centre near  
Kanchipuram. He was born blind. But he became   
a great extempore poet and was a great Vishnu devotee. Once the local king  
suddenly took the bow and arrow from his horseback and asked Veeraraghava  
Mudaliar to sing a song on what he did just then.   
The Saint Poet intently prayed to Rama and then sang: O the King, there is no Ravana, the demon here before you!   
There is no delusive deer Maricha here before you!   
There are no seven mara trees in this jungle!   
There is no ocean nearby for constructing a bridge across!   
Why then you took the bow and arrow and play with me?   
The king was very pleased and gave him lands and riches.

Auvaiyar's aathichoodi is one of the best and most simple teachings for  
humanity for simple devout and even for highly educated people. they explain  
the basic wisdom to be cultivated by each one of us. I like Auvaiyar for her  
simplicity and her emotional devotion towards Murugan.

Dear Nagaraj,   
Excellent. Avvaiyar is known for her simplicity and direct teachings.   
She starts Aathichoodi with prayer song on Siva.   
O the One wearing aathi flowers, and a young moon,   
Who is ever silent and a white body with holy ashes...!   
Arunachala Siva.

## The Children in Periya Puranam  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 03, 2009, 09:48:26 AM

There are a few children, mentioned in Periya Puranam. The first and foremost  
is Tiru Jnana Sambandhar, the first of the Great Four.   
He is a child saint. He sang his first song on Siva, when Uma gave him breast  
milk, at the age of three. He visited several Siva temples and merged in the  
effulgence at the time of his wedding, at the age of 16, in Tiru Nallur.   
The second one is SeeraLan, the son of Siru Thondar. This boy was   
brought up in the atmosphere of Siva pooja and Siva dhyana by his father. It  
is he, who was cut into pieces and cooked human flesh was offered to the  
Kabali brahmin, who came to Siru Thondar and asked for it. This is Siva. The  
boy was then called by Siva: "O SeeraLa! come and eat with me!" He came from  
the backyard! Since he submitted his own body as Siva's food, there is no  
doubt about his liberation.   
The third one is Tiru Navukkarasu, the son of Appoothi Adigal, who had named  
his son, because of his love for Tiru Navukkarasar, the one of the Great Four.  
The boy was stung by a cobra on the backyard when he had been there to pick up  
plantain leaf for the guest to eat on, Tirunavukkarasar. When the saint poet  
sang ten songs, OnRu kolam.... the boy came back alive.   
The fourth one, we do not know his name. He was devoured by the crocodile in  
the river. One year had passed. The brahmin parents were grief stricken.  
Sundaramoorthy came to the town, Tiru PokkuLiur and came to know the tragedy.  
He went to the river and sang song, praying Siva to bring back the son for his  
brahmin parents. The boy came alive, as if coming out after a bath! The poet   
Sekkizhar says: The boy, had grown more, for the years lapsed, as if he was  
fed by the crocodile inside its stomach!   
(Source: Periya Puranam. Sekkizhar. Book XII of Siva Canons. Tamil   
Verses.)   
Arunachala Siva.
