All experiences of life only pertain to the reflection of the impassive  
Purusha in the mirror of   
the buddhi, resulting in the confusion of real being himself subject to the  
trammels of existence.   
The Samkhya teleology at the summit takes the ontological position of the  
individual being always   
free, and the phenomenal existence being only an illusory contact with the  
true Person, with the   
buddhi.   
Patanjali defines the state of mind in meditation as follow: Firstly, there  
is the awareness of the   
arrested and emergent states of mind arising and disappearing, there being no  
identification   
with them, which is known as Nirodha Parinama. Initially, the Yogi is not  
aware of this thought   
which is known as Samadhi Parinama. When the sameness of thought process is  
come upon,   
it looks as though the present and previous thoughts are one and the same.  
This is known as   
Ekagraha Parinama.
