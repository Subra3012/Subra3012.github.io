## staying at Arunachala Asramam  
Author: jozia               Date: January 05, 2007, 03:41:03 PM

I have checked out both of these new web-sites and note that no-where does it  
mention whether it is still possible to stay at Arunachala Ashramam as in the  
past.   
Can one still do this ? (I haven't been there yet). And will the ashram still  
send-out taxis to the airport as in the past ?   
Thank you,   
Jozia

I think, you better contact Shri Ramanashramam authority. Here is the link to  
"Contact Us" page from the new site: http://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/contactus.html   
That's what I did when I last visited the Ashramam.

Instead of scrutinising the available present moment why you think of birth  
and death.   
You are escaping from the present life and attending unnecessary things.   
If you are sincerely interested in "who am i"scrutinise the present with  
uninterrupted awareness.

Dear Sankar and others,   
Do not 'think' about birth and death. Birth and death are only   
for those who are bound in body, world and ego. If you can   
cease to 'think' and be in the 'present', you will conquer   
both and birth and death. See Bhagavan's Ulladu Narpadu   
and Ulladu Narpadu (Anubandam), that is, Forty verses on   
Reality and Supplement to Forty verses on Reality.   
Arunachala Siva.
