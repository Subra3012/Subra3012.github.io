## Proposed changes  
Author: Graham              Date: December 04, 2009, 02:55:12 AM

After reading many posts and taking into account the views and concerns  
expressed by members, I propose to add a new board to this forum.   
This board will be dedicated to people who are new to Advaita and will be  
limited to simple clarification of terminology and concepts.   
For instance, Nisargadatta Maharaj's apparent use of Awareness/consciousness  
and Bhagavan's use of the same terms.   
This might well be a product of interpretation or translation and as such can  
cause confusion.   
During my years at the ashram it became quite evident that a standard  
terminology was applied throughout all publications.   
Sat-Chit-Ananda translates to Being-Consciousness-Bliss, not Being-Awareness-  
Bliss. The reason for this is that Awareness cannot exist without  
Consciousness. .. there has to be a Conscious Entity to be aware.   
The standard in the ashram books is: Awareness and Consciousness (capitalized) refer to the higher state or Self   
awareness and consciousness (lower-case) refer to the objective realm - the  
illusory planes or ego   
It would be useful if contributors to this forum adopted uniform terminology  
so as not to confuse others - and indeed themselves.   
Your comments are welcome   
Graham

Dear Mr. Graham,   
I welcome the introduction of the new board. If the explanation   
can be given, as you have indicated, from the standard Asramam   
books, it will be really useful. For example, Bhagavan Ramana   
uses the following words in the Tamil, Nan Yar, Who am I?   
1\. Mano-nasam.   
2\. Mana-adakkam.   
We are interpreting these two terms in our own way. Bhagavan   
Himself has said that "there is no mind", "mind is non existent,"   
etc.,   
I shall be glad to have the views on these.   
Arunachala Siva.

dear Subramaniyan ji,   
First I thank Mr.Graham for creating this forum. For people like me surely get  
benifited. Here I want to know about Mana adakkam. Mano nasam is superior one  
which every one needs. Where as mana adakkam again it may spiring up. Is it  
not. Mana adakkam is like acting as there is no reaction. But when it gets  
good opportunity it may flare up once again. Is it due to old habits (latent  
vasanas. can we call mana adakkam is mano laya.   
Ramanaduli

Mana adakkam is only control of thoughts. Mano nasam is extinction of  
thoughts.   
The book Crumbs From the Table, explain this nicely.   
Arunachala Siva.
