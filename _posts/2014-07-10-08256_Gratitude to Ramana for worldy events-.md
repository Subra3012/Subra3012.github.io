This may seem a strange question to some, but an event happened to me today  
where I narrowly escaped a very bad situation.   
I found myself immediately thinking "Thank you, beloved Ramana... thank you SO  
MUCH!!!" I suppose it's just normal feelings for a guru, but then   
it occurred to me that if I was right there in front of Ramana he may well  
have laughed at me and said that he had nothing to do with the event.   
I understand very well all about laws of karma and that what is meant to come  
to me will come, good or bad... and even then it doesn't really exist at the  
ultimate level. I understand all these things, but I was wondering from the  
point of view of Ramana lovers who have a deeper understanding of these  
things... Is this a normal response? Or do you think gratitude to Ramana for a  
worldly event would be discouraged by Ramana himself? It is a natural thing  
for me to send love and devotion to him, but when this happened today it got  
me to wondering if this is typically discouraged or encouraged within his  
tradition?   
Thank you for any insight.

Om Hridayam,   
Gratitude, Loving remembrance of The Guru or God is indeed to be  
encouraged.They help the aspirant to grow in Faith and Devotion.The event(Bad  
situation) itself has passed but what has to endure is the Faith and  
Devotion,which are invaluable irrespective of what external events confront  
us.   
Here is an excerpt from **The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna** : "In a certain village there lived a weaver. He was a very pious,soul. Everyone  
trusted him and loved him. He used to sell his goods in the market-place. When  
a customer asked him the price of a piece of cloth, the weaver would say: 'By  
the will of Rama the price of the yarn is one rupee and the labour four annas  
; by the will of Rama the profit is two annas. The price of the cloth, by the  
will of Rama, is one rupee and six annas. ' Such was the people's faith in the  
weaver that the customer would at once pay the price and take the cloth. The  
weaver was a real devotee of God. After finishing his supper in the evening,  
he would spend long hours' in the worship hall meditating on God and chanting  
His name and glories. Now, late one night the weaver couldn't get to sleep. He  
was sitting in the worship hall, smoking now and then, when a band of robbers  
happened to pass that way. They wanted a man to carry their goods and said to  
the weaver, 'Come with us.' So saying, they led him off by the hand. After  
committing a robbery in a house, they put a load of things on the weaver's  
head, commanding him to carry them. Suddenly the police arrived and the  
robbers ran away. But the weaver, with his load, was arrested. He was kept in  
the lock-up for the night. Next day he was brought before the magistrate for  
trial. The villagers learnt what had happened and came to court. They said to  
the magistrate, 'Your Honour, this man could never commit a robbery.'  
Thereupon the magistrate asked the weaver to make his statement.   
'The weaver said: 'Your Honour, by the will of Rama I finished my meal at  
night. Then by the will of Rama I was sitting in the worship hall. It was  
quite late at night by the will of Rama. By the will of Rama I had been  
thinking of God and chanting His name and glories, when by the will of Rama a  
band of robbers passed that way. By the will of Rama they dragged me with  
them; by the will of Rama they committed a robbery in a house; and by the will  
of Rama they put a load on my head. Just then, by the will of Rama the police  
arrived, and by the will of Rama I was arrested. Then by the will of Rama the  
police kept me in the lock-up for the night, and this morning by the will of  
Rama I have been brought before Your Honour.' The magistrate realized that the  
weaver was a pious man and ordered his release. On his way home the weaver  
said to his friends, 'By the will of Rama I have been released.'   
Namaskar.

Thank you. Though is Ramakrishna and Ramana's view on this topic the same? I  
am interested in Ramana's tradition specifically.

Dear Om   
I got your point. Law of karma and prarabhda are not 100% rigid as you think.   
Bhagavan's famous advise to his Mother emphasizes the surrender and Divine  
Will aspects not negative fatal determinism in the cruel hands of destiny.   
Even though Bhagavn downplayed his role in all miracles, even in my personal  
life there were many situations where the seemingly written destiny were  
definitely reduced in effect to considerable extent.   
It is defintiely the grace of Ramana and Arunachala at work that saved your  
situation. Dont believe this law of karma as total rigid one. Such a belief,  
will not save us in critical situation.   
Coming to Bhagavan's viewpoint, his preferred way is Silence. If a devotee  
silently thanks to Him (assume this is before 1950) and acknowledges his  
intervention above karma he will simply respond through Heart positively. Only  
when we aproach Bhagavan and glorify his intervention, in Open environment he  
will discourage this thanks giving. Because Bhagavan was particular that his  
hermitage should not turn into a miracle factory. Because Bhagavan shunned  
away crowd.   
Heart in Heart Bhagavan knew the Self interfered through Him in many occasions  
of his devotees but he will never pubicly Acknowledge that.   
Instead Bhagavan would prefer us to go back to Upadesa Undiyar or Ulladhu  
narpadhu and resume the main who am i enquiry. His approach is, enough of  
celerbations and 'feel safe' feeling, now that I have saved, go back to  
sadhana. His part he will complete and only our part we have to do.   
There are definitely some privileges to devotees of God that are unavailable  
to common mass who do not tune to God.   
Not only with Sri Ramana devotees, but with many other sadhakas of other Gurus  
I have heard number of near save or miraculous incidents.   
If we trust a Guru or God and follow the sadhana vigourously, the greatest  
dangers in accidents and untimely crisis are greatly avoided. I have seen  
this in many circumstanes -- at the last minute something intervenes and  
reduces the grave inauspicious crisis. It is very mysterious but Ishwara  
replicates the devotion and nama japa we do to him and the Guru.   
It is not due to rigid Law of karma that we escape. Upadesa Undiyar downplays  
karma - karmam kadavulo undhi para, karmam jada madhaal undhi para. Bhagavan  
calls karma as jadam or inert. The Agency shakthi of Ishwara only activtes  
karmic effects.   
A fortnight before there was a cobra snake in my bedroom. Generally my mother  
will not come to bedroom, but that day she came because to put eye drops to  
me. We were in discussion about Arunachala and Bhagavan Raman relation and my  
mother was saying something about saravana bhava mantra. All of a sudden she  
saw a snake which she mistook for a rope initially. it started moving just  
inches before my feet and we had a miraculous escape that day.   
Trust me -- without the grace of Arunachala and Ramana many of our whereabouts  
would have been buried and grasses would have grown as they say in Tamil  
proverb.   
God abudantly interferes in and reduces our karma.   
Regards,   
Krishna

Ah, thank you Krishna,   
It is a difficult point for me to speak clearly about. It isn't that I think  
Karma is absolute and rigid with no change possible from a loving Guru... I am  
more interested in what My beloved Ramana would want from me in response to an  
event like that. Perhaps a better analogy would be this: Ramana was very clear  
on not bothering to chase siddhis, but I never got the impression he thought  
it was bad when they arose spontaneously on their own, he would advise to  
merely watch them but not waver from the Self. Like this I was wondering if  
Ramana would want my gratitude expressed like that... I have no knowledge of  
the cause behind my escape from a bad situation so would Ramana prefer I not  
assume it was him interfering? Would it be better to watch the event unfold  
without any remarks?   
I think you have answered the question very well, I am trying to clarify my  
position. I am very drawn to the path of the Jnani, but have a Bhakti's  
disposition towards my guru... I have a heart that bubbles over with love for  
Ramana, this occurs naturally... but being isolated here in the US I have to  
ask questions sometimes that might seem odd. I want to follow Ramana the way  
he would want me to follow him.   
Thanks again.

Dear Om Hrudayam   
In my association with Ramana all these days, the only thing that will  
impress him not only in this current scenario but eternally in all scenarios  
is slowly to start asking 'to whom this protection has come' the answer is to  
me, now enquire who am i non verbally, be with your I thought, rather than  
observing, be the I thought, get immersed and be one with your own I  
thought. That for sure will 100% satisfy our Master and he will shower  
abundant blessings on one and all when we do that.   
Having said that I come to your questions. You say your Heart bubbles in love  
towards the Guru. That is the major sign of progress and jnana. Many advaita  
saints like Papaji and Saradamma realized Self only through dualistic devotion  
full and full towards Krishna and her Guru respectively. It is a paradox but  
jnana is rejected for those who do not consider the form Saguna Brahman as  
real.   
So the second option you have is only to thank your Guru again and again & do  
namaskaram. Sri Seshdari Swamigal the contemporary saint in 19th century set  
a very good example. When he met his own Guru Balaji Swamigal who appeared in  
Kanchipuram from Kashi, what Seshadri did was, he chanted the Dakshnamurthi  
slogam of Adhi Shankara and with every completion of a 4 line paragraphy, he  
prostrated full length to his Guru.   
You can also thank Guru Ramana likewise and add thankyou thankyou every time.   
 This looks funny or madness or obsession for many onlookers but this practice  
will fast forward your progress towards realization.   
One day we will do the same 'thankyou namaskaram' even when a bad thing falls  
on us.   
We cannot gain vairagya that time, so we have to start thanking only during  
good times.   
I remember one of the 12 Alwars had a outstanding attitude of devotion, when a  
good thing comes to him he will praise Lord Vishnu for the good and auspicious  
thing as was possible only due to His grace. But when evil befalls, he will  
blame his bad karma and past sins for the same. This is not just an attitude,  
this is the reality for devotee of God. Our good is returned manifold with  
high degree while our own bad karma is returned with diminished minimal  
effect. This is the act of Grace.   
Arunachalam.

Thanks again, Krishna!   
Yes, devotion for Ramana comes easily to me.   
I think it was Papa Ramdas who used to accept everything that came to him,  
good and bad,   
by saying "Ram" meaning he accepted whatever came as coming from God.   
I was very impressed with this and have tried to make it my own practice, too.   
(I am not 100% successful, but I notice when I do I can remain in a clam state  
very easily.)
