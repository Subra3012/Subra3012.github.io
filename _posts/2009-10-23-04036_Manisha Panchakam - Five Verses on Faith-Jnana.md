## Skanda Sashti - 4

There is a story. Avviayar was the great poetess of Tamil   
language. She was a devotee of Ganesa. Once she was   
travelling in a jungle under hot sun and she was thirsty and   
hungry. Skanda appeared before her from a tree top. He   
asked the poetess: Grandma, would you like to eat some jamun   
fruits, which can quench your thirst and also fill your stomach.   
The poetess said Yes. Then Skanda asked her: Do you want   
heated fruits or non heated fruits. Avvaiyar was wondering.   
How can there be heated fruits and non heated fruits? She   
is a great poetess in Tamil. Still she did not understand this   
word. She then asked: Alright, give me some heated fruits.   
The boy shook the branches and Jamun fruits fell on the sandy   
ground. The old poetess, picked them, and sent out air from   
her mouth to remove the sands covering the fruits. Normally,   
we send out air from our mouth to cool a hot substance. She   
did like that. Skanda then asked her: Grandma, is the fruit   
so hot that you breathe out air to cool it?   
The poet understood the word "heated fruit!" She looked up   
at the tree. There was Skanda. The great Tamil poet was   
fooled in her own language! She cried and said: "This tough wood which can blunt a sharp axe but   
this sharp axe has been blunted by a young plantain stem!   
This means that a young boy has defeated her in her own   
language in which she is proud about her own scholarship.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Manisha Panchakam - Five Verses on Faith/Jnana  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: October 23, 2009, 09:36:23 AM

Manisha Panchakam is the poem of five verses about Jnana   
and the faith towards it. It has got two preliminary verses,   
said to have been the questions of Sri Sankara, to the down-   
caste, Chandala, the dog-eating outcaste. The questions   
of Sri Sankara are replied by Chandala, in five verses, revealing   
the Atma Jnana and Sri Sankara finds him to be Siva, in disguise,   
having the four Vedas at the end.   
Manisha means different things. It means Shanti, Peace. It   
means Faith, it means Jnanam, Atman etc., etc.,   
Vedas end with a refrain Om Shanti, Om Shanti, Om Shanti!   
Let there be Peace in all the three worlds. It is called Shanti   
Pada.   
What is this Shanti? Peace? It is not something which is   
new to us. It is no something, which is freshly acquired.   
It is not coming from outside. No objects in the earth,   
can confer Shanti, Peace to us. It comes occasionally to us,   
as lightning flashes, but does not remain with us for ever.   
All our self enquiry or atma vichara, is only to get the Peace,   
Shanti permanently. It is getting our own Nature, which is within us, back to  
us permanently.   
This permanent Shanti, Peace, is called Brahmi-Stiti. All   
Jnanis are in this permanent abidance. Some of them like   
Bhagavan Ramana were actively engaged in wordly activity,   
(but without leaving Arunachala) and that is called Sahaja-   
Brahmi-Stiti. Bhagavan Ramana says in Sri Arunachala   
Akshara Mana Malai: Thedathu Utra Tiru AruL Nidhi, that   
which is got without searching.....   
Upanishads say that God has cheated us. They had kept Shanti   
within us, but made us search at outside in all objects.   
Arunachala Siva.

Excellent Post Subramanian ji.   
Ashtavakra Says in Ashtavakra Samhita   
 **Aayasat [by exertion, effort] sakhalo dhuki [Every one is miserable], enam  
[this] na [do not] janati [know]kaschana [everyone].   
Anena this upadeshena [instruction, teaching] eva [alone] dhanyah [Blessed]  
prapnoti [Attain] nirvrutim [liberation].**   
ALL misery is due to Effort / Exertion, people do not know this. By this  
teaching the blessed people find liberation.   
 **Vyaparo [In activity] khidhyate [feels pain] yasya nimishonmeshyor api [the  
opening and closing of eyes ]   
Tasya-alasya-Dhyrinasya [Expert in alasya or laziness master idler ]  
Sukham nanyasya kaschit**   
Bliss belongs to only the master idler to whom even the activity of opening  
and closing the eyes is an affliction and to none else.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear srkudai,   
Thank you. Manisha Panchakam, I have got in Tamil and Sanskrit.   
I do not have the English version. So translation of every sloka,   
every word has to be done carefully. I am trying one by one.   
Incidentally, you mentioned about laziness or alasya. It is an   
excellent word. David Godman in one of the recent issues of   
Mountain Path, wrote about the ecstasy of laziness or alasya,   
quoting Bhagavan Ramana.   
Bhagavan Ramana has once said to a Telugu devotee: I am the   
workelss person, ever lazy! He said: Pani ledhu vadu.   
His laziness is in the state of Bliss, where nothing is to be done,   
nothing is to be undone. But He used to do every work in the   
Asramam, with perfection, that only a Jnani can have. He used   
to cut vegetables so nicely that kitchen workers used to wonder   
at His skill. But, remember, He had never entered the kitchen   
either in Tiruchuzhi or Madurai. Once Muruganar was cutting   
vegetables along with Him. Muruganar did a clumsy job and   
Bhagavan Ramana had to re-do it. Muruganar wrote a poem: "O Venkata, why should you not marry a girl and lead a householder's life?  
Your wife would have been very happy   
at your dexterous kitchen work, that she would always be   
free without work!"   
His work was Nishkamya karma. He never did anything for Himself.   
Once in the Hill, one devotee asked: What is nishamya karma?   
He did not answer. Suddenly a shepherd appeared and told Him: "Swami, I have lost my stick (for driving the goats and sheep)?   
Can you find it?" Bhagavan Ramana said: Do not worry. He   
took out a tree branch that had fallen on the ground, nicely   
cut it with His pen knife and polished it with the leaves of the jungle trees.  
In a few minutes, the stick was ready. He gave   
it to the shepherd and continued to walk. The devotee   
understood what is nishkamya karma!   
Arunachala Siva.
