Apologizing doesn't mean that   
ur wrong and the other is right..   
It only means that u value the   
relationship more than ur ego...   
If everything is going according   
to ur wish then ur lucky..   
If its not then ur too lucky, coz   
its going according to God's wish...   
Ever noticed ur parents spend the   
first 18 months trying to make u stand   
up and talk...and The next 18 years   
trying to make u sit down n listen..   
Either walk as if u rule the world..   
or Walk as if u don't mind who   
the hell rules the world..   
That's the attitude...   
Rock ur life..   
Silly thing about affection..   
when u get little u want more...   
when u get more u desire   
even more..but when u lose it u   
realize "little" was enough..   
Never design ur character like   
a garden where anyone can walk..   
Design it like a sky where   
everyone aspires to reach..   
One of the best messages for mankind...   
"There is no market for ur sorrows..   
So never advertise ur feelings,..."   
One true fact..   
The world's thinnest book has   
only one word written in it..: "EVERYTHING" and   
The book is titled: "what a human wants??"   
True fact of life: When u need ADVICE everyone   
is ready to HELP u..but   
when u need HELP everyone   
is ready to ADVICE u..   
Never accept others definition   
of life..Its Ur life define it urself...   
We are not human beings having   
spiritual experiences..We are spiritual   
beings having human experiences..   
Two nice thoughts..   
Pray as if everything depends on god..and   
Work as if everything depends on   
u...   
To handle urself use ur head...   
To handle others use ur heart..   
To have good relations with all,   
we should keep our nature like   
a theater screen..It accepts all   
characters but remains   
peacefully white...   
Its just meaningless to expect ur   
partner to be like urself coz   
u cant hold their right hand in ur   
right hand to walk together..think over..   
Confidence never comes if v have   
all the answers, but it comes when v   
r ready for all the questions..   
Be bold to face the world..   
When ur depressed..When ur confused   
When u have been hurt the most..   
Don't ever get carried away...   
rather just get in front of the mirror,   
n there u will find d right person who   
could actually help u get out of this..   
There is always a little truth behind   
every "just kidding"   
A little knowledge behind every "I don't know"   
A little emotion behind "I don't care"   
Two aspects of life: If v become 2 sentimental, its   
2 hard to lead life and   
If v become 2 practical, its 2   
tough to respect relations..   
No one in this world is afraid 2 speak   
the truth..   
They are afraid only about the consequences   
that are to be faced after speaking the truth..   
Truth of life: what is status??   
"Spending money which we don't have to   
buy things which we don't need..   
To impress people whom we don't know..."

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Its Character which makes a person a gentleman not a tailor

While swami Vivekananda was in america seeing the strange dress swami was  
wearing one person was commenting sarcastically that he (means Swamiji) does  
not seem to be like a gentleman.   
Hearing this Swamiji retorted, " Sir I belong to a country where character  
makes a man a gentleman,and it seems that you belong to a country where  
tailors make gentle man."

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ Inner meaning of Ramayana By Swami Sivananda

For the purpose of bringing out the full philosophy of the Ramayana, one has  
to closely follow the part played by the (1) King Dasaratha (2) Manthara  
the maid servant of Kaikeyi (3). Kaikeyi-- the youngest of the king  
Dasaratha's consorts (4) Ravana the demon king of Lanka (5) Hanuman--Minister  
of the Vanara chief Sugriva (6), Sita the beloved wife of Sri Rama, the prince  
of Ayodhya (7) Lakshmana --brother of Sri Rama and ( Sri Rama --the hero of  
the great epic.   
On the eve of the coronation of Sri Rama as the Crown Prince of Ayodhya, the  
whole scheme was shelved because of the pressure brought on Dasaratha by his  
wife Kaikeyi under the instigation of her maid servant Manthara and the King's  
submission to the dictates of his wife whereby Prince Rama was exiled to the  
forest for fourteen years.   
In this context, King Dasaratha is to be compared to the ordinary man of the  
world placed in an atmosphere of pleasure and plenty falling a victim to the  
promptings of his vicious mind ( Manthara) infatuated by sense objects  
(Kaikeyi).   
The ten headed Rakshasa, Ravana, in the absense of sri Rama and Lakshmana  
steals away Sita from their forest- dwelling. Here Ravana with his ten heads  
is to be compared with the ten sense organs--five organs of knowledge, and  
five organs of action. Stealing away of Sita is to be compared to the loss of  
reasoning power of the worldly minded, deluded by Maya. The golden deer  
Maricha is Maya which deluded both Lakshmana and Rama and they lost their  
power of discrimination (Sita).   
Hanuman, the intellectual giant and strong celibate, is an invincible power  
**which indicates that if one has to achieve success in all his undertakings  
one has to cultivate truth, simplicity, purity, selfless service, devotion to  
duty,and establish oneself in absolute Bramhacharya.**   
 **Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya!!!!**

Like sita we ordinary jivas have always temptations going after illusion. When  
Sita wanted the golden deer   
Ram told her it is not a real. But to satisfy His wife's desire He went after  
the deer. In day to day life also   
it happens in so many houses. Wives demand and compel their husband to get  
luxury life then both will be in   
trouble.   
There are lots of lession we should learn from Ramayana.

Sita herself is the Maha Maya. But she played a pageant. She   
asked for a maya (illusory) deer and thus lost contact with Brahman   
(Rama) got separated by kama (Ravana) etc., and then with the   
help of the Guru (Hanuman), she regained union with Brahman!
