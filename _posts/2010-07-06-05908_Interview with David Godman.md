Dear prasanth,   
Thanks for the link. I have been reading David's blog for the past   
2 years, [www.davidgodman.org], it has been really refreshing   
with new insights. The blog also contains some biographical information about  
him and also some details regarding Tamizh works   
of Arunagirinatha and others. His two books Guru Vachaka Kovai   
and Padamalai have been done jointly by him and Dr. Venkatasubramanian and  
Robert Butler. His Final Talks with Annamalai Swami are interviews recorded  
through an interpreter.   
His Living with the Words of Bhagavan, is a well researched work   
on Annamalai Swami with a lot of carefully gathered and interpreted   
incidents and life.   
I have not bought his other books on Papaji etc.,   
Arunachala Siva.
