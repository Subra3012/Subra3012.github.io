Is it true that we ourselves are the goal that we seek?

All goals being mental there is no where to reach. Mentally motion is  
possible. Physically motion is possible. for the Self, where is the question  
of motion? It alone being, where does it move and from where ? It being beyond  
time there is no seeking, no goal etc. The mind can continue seeking, the body  
can continue moving the Self just IS.   
There is a Zen story: The laughing buddha was a zen monk who used to distrubute sweets to children.  
he used to carry a bag full of sweets. Some one went to him and asked, sir  
"what is Self realization?" he simply dropped the bag he was carrying [meaning  
to see oneself as totally actionless] and then he asked how would one live  
after self realization, he simply took the bag and went along ! [meaning,  
having known the self as motionless, let things be as they are... nothing has  
to be done in particular].

Dear DRPVSSN Raju and srkudai. Nice question. Nice Zen story.   
We are the goal, the path and the traveller in the Self.-enquiry.   
All become goal at the end. As T.S. Eliot said: "There will be time,   
there will be time, when everything looks alike." "I have measured   
my life in coffee-spoons!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Viveka Choodamani.

Dear srkudai,   
 The zen story is significant.Leaving the bag is symbolic of state of enlightenment.   
 Taking the bag again is symbolic of state "Beyond enlightenment".   
 Creating a goal is a trick of the mind to elude us from positing in the self.

Dear Raju,   
Thats an interesting perspective. An alternative perspective is   
Leaving the bag is a sign of enlightenment   
but picking up the bag is : knowing that its all a dream, one may continue  
ones usual life style.   
Love!

Dear DRPVSSN Raju and srkudai, Nice exchange of ideas. "We   
are all such stuff as dreams are made on and our little life is rounded   
with a sleep." There is a story about Kaduveli Siddhar, a Brahma   
Jnani. The King wanted to test him and sent a courtesan to attract   
him. The lady won the battle, Kaduveli Siddhar married her, begot   
a kid and was looking after the kid, whenever the lady went for   
a dancing job. She told the King also about her victory over the   
Siddhar. One day, when she was away, the baby cried for milk,   
and the Siddhar ran to the King's court to give the baby to the   
lady, who was dancing. Everyone was laughing at the Siddhar.   
"See here is a man who is said to be a Brahma Jnani but had a   
baby through illicit relationship.". The lady was dancing, and   
suddenly her anklet got snapped and she was bending to set it   
right. The Siddhar said, "I shall set right the anklet, and meantime,   
you feed the baby." The King roaring with laugher asked the   
Siddhar, "Are you a Brahma Jnani, still?" Then the Siddhar   
said pointing to a stout pillar in the hall, " Oh Pillar! If you   
are the Brahman and I am a Brahma Jnani, please open up   
and consume me!". The pillar opened up, the Siddhar went into   
the pillar and the pillar got closed as before!   
Dear 'kudai', Ultimately, the bhavana that comes out of faith,   
is a great thing in our path for self enquiry.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
 Yes that is very true. Firm conviction that "i am Awareness" is very important.   
BTW, you can call me udai. my name is udai. srk when i created my mail id,  
i was a devotee of Sri Ramakrishna[srk] and followed bhakti marga. I still  
consider him as my guru and follow bhakti, but no more am emotional abt it as  
i was earlier. right now, to me, Self Inquiry is the highest kind of Bhakti  
too!   
Love!

Dear subramanian,   
 Thanks for nice story of kaduveli siddhar which increases our conviction of "I AM THE SELF-AWARENESS".

Dear srkudai, Yes, all paths lead to the Ramana Way. He had   
no quarrel with any other paths. When Aurobindo said that   
there is a Super Mind, which is beyond mind, Bhagavan said: there are no two minds, but only one mind and only vasanas   
are many. But He permitted certain devotees to go to Aurobindo   
to puruse the path most suited to them.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian.R,   
There are no "sins" \-- predestined incidents only. Forgrtfulness is also  
predestined, as well as rememberance.   
Yours in the Self

Dear vladimir,   
 When subramanian says forgetfulness is a sin,it is not literal,he means self-forgetfulness is inimical to spiritual growth.

Dear Vladimir and Raju, All sins are predestined incidents.   
But here, what Bhagavan refers is the Forgetfulness of the Self,   
which is our permanent nature and this forgetfulness is the sin.   
Whether, this is also happening as pre destined, is depending   
on one's carry of 'vasanas', our inherent tendencies acquired   
out of previous births.   
Arunachala Siva.
