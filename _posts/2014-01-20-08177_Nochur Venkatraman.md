## Sri Arunachala Ashtakam - Mountain Path, Jan. - Mar. 2014.  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: January 20, 2014, 01:15:30 PM  
---  
(By William Forbes and Narendra Kesari Sarma: There are many poetic works composed in praise of Arunachala. This particular  
Stuti was published in a volume titled   
Stotrarnavah, from the series of the Madras Government Oriental Manuscript  
Series', Volume LXX edited by T. Chandrasekharan,   
1961, page 74. For those interested, the volume can be found at the  
University of Madras Oriental Manuscript Library,   
which originally published it. The catalogue notation on it is ACC. 16097, S.  
4968.   
We do not know who the author of this work is. It was the tradition to  
attribute a poetic work to someone other than the   
original author as a mark of respect or to leave the work anonymous.   
There is another Stuti attributed to Sankaracharya which affirms the  
importance of giri pradakshina and the belief common in   
tradition and among devotees of Arunachala, that thinking of Arunachala when  
one dies, gives liberation.   
The composition does contain verses and lines which are common to several  
other works, in praise of Arunachala and Lord   
Siva in general. Though this work is said to be an Ashtakam or composed of of  
eight verses, it is actually eleven. This is not   
uncommon, for example, Bhagavan composed Arunachala Padigam which normally  
should be of ten verses but instead it is of   
eleven verses.   
The first verse is particularly well known in south India and is quoted in  
the Arunachala Puranam which says the verse originated   
in the Rudra Samhita of the Skanda Puranam. The last verse is a summation.   
The work is marked by laudable poetic skills and devotion to Arunachala.   
contd.,   
Arunachala Siva.

Sri Arunachala Ashtakam: 1.   
From a darshan at Chidambaram1   
From taking birth in Tiruvarur2   
For dying in Kasi,3 one certainly gets liberation,   
(and also) from remembering Arunachala.   
1\. The Seat of Consciousness   
2\. The Lotus of Spiritual Heart   
3\. The Light of Realization.   
2\.   
From remembering Arunachala - the One   
Whose outer corners of the eyes are filled with compassion   
For those who come to Him (like a calf to its mother) for refuge,   
Who has the new moon and matted hair on His head.   
3.   
For remembering Arunachala - the One   
Who is the Support of the whole world,   
Who is the Embodiment of Existence- Consciousness-Bliss,   
And Who has thousand(s) of warriors.   
4\.   
From bringing to mind Arunachala - the One   
Who shines like a statue of gold,   
Who grants one's desired object and its fruit,   
And Who is the Chief of the Gods. O save me!   
5.   
From thinking of Arunachala - the One   
Whose locks of matted hair are studded with the moon,   
Whose body is half female,   
And Who is like an ever expanding ocean of mercy.   
6\.   
From thinking of Arunachala - the One   
Whose golden reflection shines forth,   
With he brilliance of ten million suns,   
And Who is captured by meditation at Chidambaram.   
7.   
From thinking of Arunachala - the One   
Who a a lesson for all he enemies of the Gods,   
Who consumed (and held) the deadly poison in His throat,   
Protecting all worshippers.   
8.   
From recalling Arunachala - the One   
Who has eight forms,   
Who grants the objects of one's desire,   
And its fruit to those who have superior devotion.   
9.   
From remembering Arunachala - the Guru,   
Who is the Sovereign of the Gods,   
Who has bright red lotus feet,   
And Who is served by Brahma, Vishnu and Indra.   
10.   
From remembering Arunachala - one attains the Goddess   
Worshipped by Indra and other gods,   
With flowers of the wish-fulfilling celestial coral tree, Mallika-jasmine,   
Jati-Jasmine, Kunda-Jasmine, Champaka-magnolia and lotus.   
11.   
From remembering Arunachala - the One   
Who creates prosperity,   
Who is Parvati's Lord,   
Who has the sun, the moon, and fire in His eyes,   
And a gentle smile on His lotus face.   
Thus ends the complete Sri Arunachala Ashtakam.   
Arunachala Siva.

Okay, I don't want to interrupt this process that is in fact "finished". BUT,  
I thought about something this morning. I know it can be expensive, but what  
do you think about possibility to buy some paid board software like Invision  
Power Board (IPB)? It is expensive first time, when you need to pay 175US$,  
BUT later only after 6 months you buy renewal of the license. I used to be  
admin of some of these IPB forums, and I know how it is good forum software in  
the practice.   
Just want that you think about that. SMF and other free alternatives are good  
enough, but they don't provide much of the security, protection against the  
spammers, and many other issues. With this IPB forum, we would get even small  
chat room integrated, it is already paid and free up to 5 people. For more we  
would need to pay more, or transfer to some other irc chat, or something  
else... but okay, there are not many users active online at the same time,  
this chat would be even good, who needs more with someone, or group chat there  
is irc, skype, or something else, that is similar.   
What do you think about all this?   
Also, I don't want that we hurry and to run after IPB, NOW... because I have  
just read that they are very soon to make a new version of it v4.x.x, maybe  
even during the middle of this year, we will see... at least I am looking  
forward to...   
Thanks for your time to read and consider all this... OM Shanti... _/\\_

Perfect! Dear Graham, is it possible for you to transfer and the topic  
Fundamental questions about mind (http://www.ramana-  
maharshi.info/forum/index.php?topic=7047.0) into this forum and to not delete  
http://www.ramana-maharshi.info/forum/index.php because there are many topics  
there which are not present here. Let it be like archives without option for  
posting. Thank you.

Okay, I don't want to interrupt this process that is in fact "finished". BUT,  
I thought about something this morning. I know it can be expensive, but what  
do you think about possibility to buy some paid board software like Invision  
Power Board (IPB)? It is expensive first time, when you need to pay 175US$,  
BUT later only after 6 months you buy renewal of the license. I used to be  
admin of some of these IPB forums, and I know how it is good forum software in  
the practice.   
Just want that you think about that. SMF and other free alternatives are good  
enough, but they don't provide much of the security, protection against the  
spammers, and many other issues. With this IPB forum, we would get even small  
chat room integrated, it is already paid and free up to 5 people. For more we  
would need to pay more, or transfer to some other irc chat, or something  
else... but okay, there are not many users active online at the same time,  
this chat would be even good, who needs more with someone, or group chat there  
is irc, skype, or something else, that is similar.   
What do you think about all this?   
Also, I don't want that we hurry and to run after IPB, NOW... because I have  
just read that they are very soon to make a new version of it v4.x.x, maybe  
even during the middle of this year, we will see... at least I am looking  
forward to...   
Thanks for your time to read and consider all this... OM Shanti... _/\\_

Yes,and likewise, it would also do him immense good if he were to pack off all  
the gurus,masters and saints and discover the immensity of the spirit that is  
his true Nature.

_WHY art thou silent! Is thy love a plant   
Of such weak fibre that the treacherous air   
Of absence withers what was once so fair?   
Is there no debt to pay, no boon to grant?   
Yet have my thoughts for thee been vigilant--   
Bound to thy service with unceasing care,   
The mind's least generous wish a mendicant   
For nought but what thy happiness could spare.   
Speak--though this soft warm heart, once free to hold   
A thousand tender pleasures, thine and mine,   
Be left more desolate, more dreary cold   
Than a forsaken bird's-nest filled with snow   
'Mid its own bush of leafless eglantine--   
Speak, that my torturing doubts their end may know! _

_A man came with a basket of fruits. The fruits were meant for offering. He  
asked the monks what he should do with the basket. They told him to throw it  
out in the lane. Mother looked at the lane and said, "Look there. They have  
asked him to throw away such a nice basket! It does not matter for them in the  
least. They are all monks and totally unattached. But we cannot allow such a  
waste. We could have utilized it at least for keeping the vegetable peelings."  
She asked someone to fetch the basket and wash it. It was kept for some future  
use._

_God Himself has provided different forms of worship. He who is the Lord of  
the Universe has arranged all these forms to suit different men in different  
stages of knowledge.   
The mother cooks different dishes to suit the stomachs of her different  
children. Suppose she has five children. If there is a fish to cook, she  
prepares various dishes from it - pilau,pickled fish, fried fish, and so on -  
to suit their different tastes and powers of digestion._

_A man cannot get rid of body-consciousness as long as he is attached to  
worldly things and loves 'woman and gold'. As he becomes less and less  
attached to worldly things, he approaches nearer and nearer to the Knowledge  
of Self. He also becomes less and less conscious of his body. He attains Self-  
Knowledge when his worldly attachment totally disappears. Then he realizes  
that body and soul are two separate things. It is very difficult to separate  
with a knife the kernel of a coconut from the shell before the milk inside has  
dried up. When the milk dries up, the kernel rattles inside the shell. At that  
time it loosens itself from the shell. Then the fruit is called a dry coconut.   
The sign of a man having realized God is that he has become like a dry  
coconut. He has become utterly free from the consciousness that he is the  
body. He does not feel happy or unhappy with the happiness or unhappiness of  
the body. He does not seek the comforts of the body. He roams about in the  
world as a jivanmukta, one liberated in life. 'The devotee of Kali is a  
jivanmukta, full of Eternal Bliss.'_

_When you find that the very mention of God 's name brings tears to your eyes  
and makes your hair stand on end, then you will know that you have freed  
yourself from attachment to 'woman and gold' and attained God. If the matches  
are dry, you get a spark by striking only one of them. But if they are damp,  
you don't get a spark even if you strike fifty. You only waste matches.  
Similarly, if your mind is soaked in the pleasure of worldly things, in 'woman  
and gold', then God-Consciousness will not be kindled in you. You may try a  
thousand times, but all your efforts will be futile. But no sooner does  
attachment to worldly pleasure dry up than the spark of God flashes forth._

TRAILOKYA: _What is the way to dry up the craving for worldly pleasure?_   
MASTER: _Pray to the Divine Mother with a longing heart. Her vision dries up  
all craving for the world and completely destroys all attachment to 'woman and  
gold'. It happens instantly if you think of Her as your own mother. She is by  
no means a godmother. She is your own mother. With a yearning heart persist in  
your demands on Her. The child holds to the skirt of its mother and begs a  
penny of her to buy a kite. Perhaps the mother is gossiping with her friends.  
At first she refuses to give the penny and says to the child: 'No, you can't  
have it. Your daddy has asked me not to give you money. When he comes home  
I'll ask him about it. You will get into trouble if you play with a kite now.'  
The child begins to cry and will not give up his demand. Then the mother says  
to her friends: 'Excuse me a moment. Let me pacify this child.' Immediately  
she unlocks the cash-box with a click and throws the child a penny.   
You too must force your demand on the Divine Mother. She will come to you  
without fail._
