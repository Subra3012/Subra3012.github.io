A person is just doing atma vichara. The telephone rings? He picks up. Someone  
asks ARE YOU THERE?   
What could be his answer.

Ramanaduli Garu,   
Once a devotee asked guru ramana what he should do if there is some  
disturbance during meditation and below is the conversation.   
Quote  
Jivarajani: Suppose there is some disturbance during meditation,such as  
mosquito bites, should one persist in meditation and try to bar the bites and  
ignore the interruption or drive the mosquitoes away and then continue the  
meditation?   
 **Bhagavan:You must do as you find most convenient. You will not attain mukti  
simply because you refrain from driving the mosquitoes away. Nor being denied  
mukti simply because you drive them away. The thing is to attain is one  
pointedness and then attain mano nasa.** Whether you do this by putting up  
with the mosquito bites or driving the mosquitoes away is left to you. **If  
you are completely absorbed in your meditation, you will not know that the  
mosquitoes are biting you.Till you attain that stage why should you not drive  
away them away?**   
 **Source** : Arunachala's Ramana, Boundless Ocean of Grace,Volume 5. Sri  
Ramanasramam, Tiruvannamalai)   
Similarly if we are completely absorbed in meditation or atma vichara ideally  
telephone rings or any other disturbance should not matter us. Until then as  
bhagavan says why should you not talk normally as usual to the other person in  
the telephone.   
BTW,i never tried anytime Ramanaduli Garu such a deep completely absorption  
though i am suggesting you.

Deep absorption can take place only in deep sleep. But in waking state if we  
do atma vichara while walking, eating and talking it seems we are in the  
middle of the river which got two banks. One side atma vichara and other side  
worldly affairs. Yes. if we do all karmas without doership, then there is no  
accumulation of destiny.,

well said ramanaduli garu.   
I believe guru ramana was in deep absorption while he was staying in Patala  
Lingam that even mosquito bites will not shake his dhyana.   
Is it not for this reason he is maharshi?   
What a great soul is our guru ramana.   
All glories to Guru Ramana.

Dear prasanth,   
In Patala Lingam, Bhagavan Ramana was stung by scorpions too.   
Dear Ramanaduli,   
Yes. We are all trying to do atma vichara which is one of the banks   
of the river and the other is the worldly life. Bhagavan Ramana says   
in ULLadu Narpadu - Supplement, Verse 27: "Yes. You show happiness,  
excitement, nervousness - do all these, as a play!   
"Seeming to have enthusiasm, and delight, seeming to have excitement and  
aversion, seeming to exercise initiative and perseverance, and yet without  
attachments, all these as play in the world. Released from all bonds of  
attachment,and with equanimity of mind, acting outwardly in all situations in  
accordance 'with the part you have assumed', play as you please, O hero in  
the world!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
 Please try to understand the mechanics of this.   
There can be three kinds of people.   
1\. Someone who is not aware that he is Consciousness [the beggar who never  
heard that he is the king].   
2\. Someone who heard that he is consciousness but is still not able to own it  
up.   
3\. Someone who has owned up his kingdom.   
The first and second type of people need just the conviction. We all fall  
under these categories. (3) is unique. like a Ramana. And what we need is no a  
new kind of practice, but the conviction that i am the king.   
This is why i specifically consider JK, Osho etc to be deviating from the  
truth and beating round the bush.   
Love!   
Silence
