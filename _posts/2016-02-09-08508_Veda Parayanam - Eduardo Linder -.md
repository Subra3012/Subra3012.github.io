(The above article appeared in Aradhana 2005 issue of Mountain Path.)   
The Vedas are considered the highest revelation and authority in Hinduism.  
Orthodox philosophical   
systems and religious authorities in India acknowledge their absolute truth  
and validity for all time,   
and revere them as ultimate authority in any controversy. No human source can  
be attributed to them   
and they are considered to be of divine origin, revealed to the Rishis of  
ancient times. The Vedas   
were a strictly oral tradition and among pundits today it is Brahma Rishi  
Vyasa who is considered to be   
the 'compiler' of the four extant texts, Rk, Yajus, Sama and Atharvana. For  
thousands of years the   
four were chanted solely without being written down. The term Sruti (meaning  
what is heard) is used to   
refer to these holy texts which ultimately communicate the nature of Absolute  
Truth in the metaphysical   
sphere. Sound emanates as 'the Word' (nama) and can be said to precede Rupa  
(form). The beginning   
of the Gospel of St.John states this truth in a similar manner.

The vibration which is generated by the holy sounds is spiritual in nature and  
counters the dark forces   
of inert matter in an effort to uplift creation. The universal mantra AUM,  
now known throughout   
the world, is the essential spiritual vibration of the universe. Sanskrit,  
the language of the Vedas,   
is said to have been revealed and it is claimed that the sounds of that form  
in 50 letters and perfect   
grammar are unique. Even Western philologists study it as a great revelation  
in the course of human   
history.   
There is a school of research today which refutes the notion that Sanskrit  
originated in Central Asia   
or the Caucasus and was transported to India during the 'Aryan Invasion'. The  
idea was propounded   
in the late nineteenth century by Western philologists, some of whom had never  
visited India. It is   
currently argued that Sanskrit was indigenous and that its texts go back  
several thousand years.   
European languages quite possibly developed from Sanskrit and not the reverse.

A great many hymns, ceremonies and philosophical matters are contained in the  
Vedas, the principal   
section of each Veda being Samhita (hymns), Brahmanas (ceremonies), and  
Aranyaka (philosophical   
treatises). The Upanishads are usually contained in the last section, known as  
'forest dialogues', since   
they were imparted by Rishis mostly living in forest ashrams.   
The highest philosophical thought in India is revealed in the Upanishads of  
which 108 are extant today.   
Of these 10 major Upanishads are widely studied and known. Sri Sankara's  
commentaries on these   
texts from the eighth century A.D.are available to scholars and are considered  
one of the pillars of the   
last school of philosophy to emerge, i.e. Advaita Vedanta. The portion of the  
Vedas referring to 'knowledge'   
is called Jnana Kanda, while the portion that deals with the rituals and  
sacrifices is termed Karma Kanda.   
It is generally agreed that a spiritual seeker must first purify himself  
through a self less process of karma,   
according to his dharma and that he can then pass on to Jnana Kanda.   
Today the Rig and Yajur Vedas are the most commonly known and chanted,  
followed by the Sama Veda.   
The Atharvana Veda is slowly disappearing. The Rig Veda is the 'root' Veda  
and contains many hymns   
to various gods of Hindu pantheon including, Indra, Rudra, Saraswati, Vishnu,  
etc., The other Vedas   
contain many mantras from the Rig Veda.

The Yajur Veda has two well known derivatives that are chanted today, the  
Sukla and the Krishna   
(White and Black), dealing mostly with rituals. At all Siva temples where  
Vedic ritual is performed,   
parts of the Veda known as Chamakam, Namakam, Rudram, etc., are used in pujas.  
Participants   
often know these sections by heart. The Krishna Yajur Veda consists of 44  
prashna (chapters) which   
in turn are divided into 7 kandas (major divisions) in the Samhita, 28 in the  
Brahmana, divided into   
3 ashtakas (including 3 prashnas called katakams) and 10 in the Aranyaka. In  
this last section the   
final 4 chapters are Upanishads.   
The chanting style of the Sama Veda is very melodious and is reminiscent of  
the Gregorian chant   
in the Christian monastic tradition.   
To this day, the Vedas are passed down from the generation to generation, from  
a Brahmin teacher   
to a male Brahmin student in a continuous lineage from its originators, the  
great Brahma Rishis.   
In fact a young boy when initiated during the Upanayanam or 'thread' ceremony  
is given his Gotra,   
or lineage, which links him to the great ancient sages like Vasishata and  
Viswamitra. The Gayatri   
mantra is imparted at this time and should be repeated 108 times daily during  
the sandya   
(junctures of the day) - sunrise, noon and sunset. This mantra appears in all  
four Vedas and was   
considered to be very secret. In fact, traditionally the Vedas were not to be  
heard by non Brahmins.   
Formerly this was strictly observed and the purity of the tradition was  
maintained but during the   
20th century, especially after independence from Britain,. when Hindu social  
laws and customs   
changed considerably, secrecy was no longer maintained to such an extent.

The school where a young boy is sent, the Veda Patasala is run even today on  
the ancient system   
of Gurukula, where the boy is given over to the guru by his parents for all  
further study. It is a rigorous   
course of training, where 7 year old boys (some start younger) start their  
lessons at 5.00 am. with chanting   
lasting for at least 8 hours a day. No doubt a prodigious memory is required.  
Some outstanding students   
can memorize an entire page within two or three readings. The course takes  
around 7 to 8 years for a\   
normal student, but some take much longer and some drop out mid way and take  
up other work, or   
practice as priests in small temples.   
On completion of his studies a student is qualified to be called Veda-Vit, or  
Yajur Vedi. No other subjects   
are usually taught at this stage, since a great deal of attention is required  
for accurately memorizing   
and correctly chanting the Vedas. The prescribed religious observances are  
carried on by all students   
together with their course work in the school day.

Teaching techniques differ according to the tradition of the teacher. The  
following remarks will shed some   
light on the process. First, of course, the alphabet must be learned and here  
there is a difference between   
South India and North India. In the South grantha script is used, while in  
the North, it is the devanagari,   
the usual Sanskrit alphabet. The Brahmanas are usually learned first since  
these mantras are simpler and   
easier for grasp. The teacher recites one Vakya, (line) and the student  
repeats it twice. For a normal student   
10 to 30 lines may be given, but for an outstanding student up to 500 lines.  
This will continue for 9 days,'   
during which a student is expected to repeat the lesson at least 100 times per  
day. Once the Samhitas   
are taken up, they are taught 50 padas (words) at a time. This is called a  
panchashati. There are 2195   
panchshatis in the 7 kandas of the Samhita of the Krishna Yajur Veda. There  
is no doubt that very strong   
samskaras play an important part concerning the innate ability of the student.  
At the level of ghanam   
(the most advanced chant form), one can almost be assured that samskaras from  
a previous life are at   
work, since this very exacting mode of chanting cannot be taken up by most  
students.   
At Sri Ramanasramam the Krishna Yajur Veda was chanted twice a day when  
Bhagavan was in the body.   
This tradition is carried on at His Samadhi to this day. Before the Veda  
Patasala was founded at Sri   
Ramanasramam, pundits from town would come to chant in front of Bhagavan and  
all accounts of His life   
mention that at the 5 p.m. session of the Veda Parayanam, Bhagavan would sit  
rock-like and the silence   
and grace that were present would be apparent to even casual visitors. He  
commented that listening to the   
Vedas had a calming effect on His mind, which is a precondition for any  
meditation practice, as well as   
Atma vichara, His most well known method.

Today, at Sri Ramanasramam, the Veda Patasala has around 20 students and  
slowly the 'career' of being a   
pundit is regaining its former respect and status. About a hundred years ago,  
due to economic conditions   
of times, Brahmins had to abandon their dharma as pundits and priests and  
engage in worldly pursuits,   
usually in posts as civil servants with the British administration. They  
could not make a living from the   
traditional way of life and slowly the tradition degenerated and fewer boys  
were brought into a formal study   
of the Vedas. The situation has currently reversed and today pundits can earn  
a very reasonable income,   
as they are invited to all types of ceremonies throughout the country,  
including household rituals and marriage   
functions. Of course, many Brahmins have now totally abandoned their links  
with the Vedas as a modern education in English is the standard of success in  
modern Indian society. Many boys are not taught the basic   
texts and have no knowledge of Sanskrit or religious duties, but one still  
sees a few modern young men in   
Western dress chanting happily in front of Bhagavan's Samadhi, no doubt due to  
the influence of their parents   
fostering a more 'religious' and traditional way of life.   
When qualified, a student will either continue studying rituals and become a  
priest, or follow further study   
and eventually become a pundit. This latter tradition involves chanting in  
more complicated modes and   
each additional level may take two or three years longer, depending on the  
ability of the student. Pundits   
are usually invited to special religious events at large temples or to  
important feasts and festivals. In   
Tiruvannamalai at Arunachaleswarar Temple, the main Siva temple. Veda  
Parayanam in the 'kramam'   
mode of the Krishna Yajur Veda is chanted for 9 days by 25 pundits during the  
10 day Kartogao Deepam   
festival. Sama Veda and Rig Veda are also chanted by smaller groups. In 1995,  
the entire Samhita in the   
ghanam mode was chanted in Sri Ramanasramam (New Hall) by an eminent Vedic  
scholar, lasting 32   
days, eight hours per day. In recent years, groups of 4 to 6 pundits are  
occasionally invited for special   
parayanam, usually lasting 4 to 6 days, with some sessions lasting 2 to 3  
hours, for a total of 6 hours per day.

After the normal chanting called Padam and Moolam, the next level is termed  
Kramam, which is still   
not too complicated and most good students master it. The last two modes  
called Jattai and Ghanam   
are particularly difficult. The last mode is achieved by very few pundits.  
They are called Ghanapatins.   
The rules for the more complex types of chanting are given in two texts not  
within the Vedas, called   
Pratasakra and Uyasa Siksha. A more detailed explanation of a mantra in  
different modes will be given   
later.   
A fully qualified Ghanapatin may continue to study Vedanga, i.e.the limbs of  
the Veda. This includes   
the following six disciplines: Siksha (phonetics); Nirukta (lexicon and  
etymology); Kalpa (Rituals);   
Lakshanam (Grammar); Jyotisha (Astrology and Astronomy); and Chandas (Prosody  
or versification).   
There are different levels and specializations in all these disciplines, and  
major Mutts, such as   
Sringeri and Kanchipuram, carry out tests and give certification that a  
certain level of knowledge and   
proficiency has been achieved. Eventually a highly trained and qualified  
pundit becomes a well known   
teacher in his own right and is recognized throughout India for his erudition.

To give an idea of the level that may be reached, one can point to Kavyakanta  
Ganapati Muni,   
Bhagavan's foremost disciple in the Vedic tradition. At the age of about 8,  
Ganapati Muni started   
uttering Sanskrit poetry spontaneously and eventually was given the title of  
Kavyakanta, which   
means 'one who has poetry flowing from his throat' i.e. an extempore poet. He  
was also a chaturvedi   
meaning he knew all four Vedas and it was later remarked by Bhagavan that  
Ganapati Muni's memory   
was such that he had almost 'total recall' of all events that had occurred in  
the Asramam. Even at this   
level of erudition, Ganapati Muni recognized that Bhagavan was not only a  
Rishi, but a 'great Rishi',   
i.e.a Maharshi and changed His name to 'Ramana Maharshi' (he was previously  
known as Brahmana   
Swami). Bhagavan had never studied Sanskrit, yet He could utter perfect poetic  
compositions, with   
such deep and terse meaning that they were considered by Kavyakanta to be  
comparable to the   
Upanishads. Throughout the rest of his life, Bhagavan was consulted by great  
pundits from all over   
India, who went away convinced that Bhagavan was indeed a Maha Rishi.   
Pundits who pass their entire lives chanting the Vedas are going through a  
process of purification and   
some of them report that even in their sleep the holy utterances carry on.  
The audiences and sponsors   
of the Yagnas and other parayanams are also being purified and accumulate  
merit, but one can also   
say that the chanting benefits the entire world. One interesting fact worth  
mentioning is that in the   
poornaahuti at the end of homa, the pundit symbolically surrenders his ego  
into the sacred fire.   
Arunachala Siva.

In Sri Adi Shankara's Viveka Choodamani, it is stated that it is difficult to  
obtain a human birth, more   
difficult to be born a Brahmin, more difficult still to walk the path of  
Vaidika Dharma in which the Vedas   
are chanted, but still more difficult to become a perfect scholar. Yet it is  
pointed out that all of this is   
still not enough 'to attain wisdom born of experience of the Self', which is  
what Bhagavan intimately knew   
for which it is not necessary to follow the path described above.   
One comment worth quoting with respect to the reason for the more complex  
types of chanting was   
made by the late Shankaracharya of Kanchipuram Mutt, Sri Chandrashekhara  
Saraswati, who was   
recognized throughout India as a saint and sage.   
'Our forefathers devised a number of methods to preserve the unwritten Vedas  
in their original form,   
to safeguard their tonal and verbal purity. They laid down rules to make sure  
that not a syllable was   
changed in chanting... and they insured that the full benefits were derived  
from intoning the mantras.   
'When we listen to the Ghanapatin chant the Ghanam we notice he intones a few  
words of the mantra   
in different ways, back and forth. It is most delightful to the ear.  
Similarly, in other methods of chanting   
like Krama, Jata, Moola, and so on the intonation is nothing less than  
stately, indeed divine.' (Hindu   
Dharma - Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan.)   
As a small example of the various modes of chanting, a simple mantra is  
transliterated below, giving the   
principal forms that are taught and chanted: Namo Somaya cha (moolam)   
Namo Somaya somaya cha (kramam)   
Namo somaya somaya namo, nama somaya (jattai)   
Nama somaya somaya, namo, nama somaya cha-cha somaya namo, nama somaya cha  
(ghanam)   
In Jattai two words are joined in the chanting and each word is repeated six  
times, while in Ghanam there   
words are joined together and each word is repeated thirteen times. A rough  
guide to the sequence   
in which Ghanam, is chanted is given below: 1-2-2-1-1-2-3-3-2-1-1-2-3-2-3-3-2-2-3-4-4-3-2-2-3-4-3-4-4-3-3-4-5-5-4-3-3-4-5.

There are, of course, different tones, lengths of syllable chanted, emphasis  
of particular sounds and volumes   
uttered, ranging from faint, whispers to great bellowing sounds which  
literally 'shake the walls'.   
While the chanting alternates between two groups, it is termed as Charchai.  
Ghanam can only be chanted   
for the Samhita portion of the Vedas. A very interesting and advanced  
technique of chanting is called   
Varna Kramam known only to highly qualified Ghanapatins. Even though it sounds  
rather simple, it is   
very difficult as each word in the Vedas is slowly analyzed for its deeper  
significance, starting from where   
in the body the sound originates, how it travels up through the throat and  
finally how the tongue is positioned   
to utter the holy sound. The purpose is to maintain the purity of the  
chanting and it is possible to ascertain   
very precisely whether a pundit is chanting a specific pada correctly or not.  
Some eminent pundits know   
Varna Kramam for every single word in the Vedas.   
This description does not of course communicate the experience of listening  
intently to the Vedas chanted   
directly, where often a state of immense peace is felt by the listener,  
highlighting the divine origin of these   
great ancient texts. Bhagavan stated that merely listening to the Vedas, even  
without understanding them,   
was sufficient to purify the listeners and to alter their state of  
consciousness to a deeper level within themselves.   
concluded.
