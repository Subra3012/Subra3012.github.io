RAMA asked: But, Holy sir, how can one restrain this wheel of cosmic illusion  
which revolves with such tremendous force?   
 **VASISTHA replied: O Rama, the mind is the hub around which this vicious  
cycle revolves, creating delusion in the minds of the deluded.** It is by  
firmly restraining that hub through intense self-effort and keen intelligence  
that the whole wheel is brought to a standstill. When the hub's motion is  
stopped the wheel does not revolve: when the mind is stilled, illusion ceases.  
One who does not know this trick and does not practice it, undergoes endless  
sorrow; the moment the truth is seen, behold! the sorrow comes to an end.   
 **The disease of the perception of this world-illusion is not cured except  
through the mastery of the mind.** Hence O Rama, abandon all other activities  
like pilgrimage, gifts and austerities, and bring the mind under your control  
for our ultimate good. **This world appearance abides in the mind, even as  
there is space within the pot; if the pot is broken, the illusory division of  
space vanishes and if the mind ceases to be, the concept of a world within the  
mind also ceases to be. Even as an insect trapped within the pot attains  
freedom of movement when the pot is broken, you will also enjoy freedom when  
the mind ceases to be, along with the world-illusion contained in it.**   
Live in the present with your consciousness externalized momentarily, but  
without any effort: when the mind stops linking itself to the past and to the  
future it becomes no-mind. If from moment to moment your mind dwells on what  
is and drops it effortlessly at once, the mind becomes no-mind, full of  
purity. **It is only as long as the mind continues to be agitated that it  
experiences diversity of its own projection or expansion, even as rain falls  
only as long as there are clouds; and it is only as long as the infinite  
consciousness limits itself into the finite mind that such agitation and  
expansion take place.** If consciousness ceases to be the finite mind, then  
know that the very roots of cyclic world-illusion (of birth and death) are  
burnt and there is perfection.
