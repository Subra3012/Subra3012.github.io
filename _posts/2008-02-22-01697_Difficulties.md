## Is heaven and hell real?

Is heaven and hell real or myths created to induce fear in wrongdoers?   
Pain is a sensation experienced by the brain and science says that the brain  
ceases all activity at the time of death. Therefore, when the body and soul or  
Self, detach when death occurs, how is the soul going to experience pleasure  
or pain at heaven or hell.   
Has Bagawan Maharishi talked on this subject?

From _Guru Vachaka Kovai_, translated by Sadhu Om   
178   
O men, do not argue and quarrel amongst yourselves about the reality of heaven  
and hell. As long and as far as this present world is real, till then and to  
that extent heaven and hell are also real.   
179   
If those geniuses who assert 'Yes, this world and this body which we see do  
really exist' would sit and scrutinize [this matter] with me, I would  
certainly point out the them, 'Yes, not only does this world really exist, but  
also do other worlds such as heaven and hell.'   
180   
Only those who do not know the nature of misery are terrified by the tortures  
of hell. But if one understands what misery is, one will know the way to end  
it, and will certainly attain one's natural state of bliss.   
pages 47, 48 and 49 of _Guru Vachaka Kovai_. The same idea is found on page  
286 of _Padamalai_, verses 40 and 41, where Bhagavan says: 'To whatever extent this world is real, to that same extent are other worlds  
real. Only this much can be said about heaven and hell without giving rise to  
arguments.'

Thank you for your response "sonagiri".   
I am not arguing or making a statement. My doubt is over the purported pain or  
pleasure in the hearafter as extolled by all scriptures. This does not square  
off with medical science which asserts that brain ceases all activity at point  
of death and the body will not experience any stimuli. Here, the body ceases  
to exist and the Self or Atma detaches itself. The Self is independent of pain  
or pleasure, as these are exclusive to the body. If at all the Self is to be  
punished for the sins of the body that it had cast off, then it (ie the Self)  
has to be re-incarnated in another body to suffer the punishement. Hence, it  
appears heaven or hell plays no role while the Self is bodyless.   
These are just my wandering thoughts.

In my earlier posting I noted that Bhagavan's position on this subject was  
that the heavenly realms were as real (or as unreal) as the one we live in.  
That is to say, if you take this world to be real, then there is also a  
heavenly realm in which one can live; and while one is there, it will appear  
to be real. However, once the 'I' that creates this world has been eradicated,  
then these heavens and hells also disappear along with it. Here are four  
explanations by Bhagavan. The first two accept that heavenly realms will be  
real to those who take our own world to be real, while the third and fourth,  
coming from the standpoint of the Self, denies them a real, independent  
reality : Question: People talk of Vaikunta, Kailasa, Indraloka, Chandraloka [the  
heavenly realms of the Hindu gods], etc. Do they really exist?   
Bhagavan: Certainly. You can rest assured that they all exist. There also a  
swami like me will be found seated on a couch and disciples will also be  
seated around him. They will ask something and he will say something in reply.  
Everything will be more or less like this. What of that? If one sees  
Chandraloka, one will ask for Indraloka, and after Indraloka, Vaikunta and  
after Vaikunta, Kailasa, and so on, and the mind goes on wandering. Where is  
shanti [peace]? If shanti is required, the only correct method of securing it  
is by self-enquiry. Through self-enquiry Self-realisation is possible. If one  
realises the Self, one can see all these worlds within ones Self. The source  
of everything is ones own Self, and if one realises the Self, one will not  
find anything different from the Self. Then these questions will not arise.  
There may or may not be a Vaikunta or a Kailasa but it is a fact that you are  
here, isnt it? Who are you here? Where are you? After you know about these  
things, you can think of all those worlds.   
( _Letters from Sri Ramanasramam_, 31st January, 1946)   
Question: Are the gods Iswara or Vishnu and their sacred regions Kailasa or  
Vaikunta real?   
Bhagavan: As real as you are in this body.   
Question: Do they possess a vyavahara satya, i.e., phenomenal existence, like  
my body? Or are they fictions like the horn of a hare?   
Bhagavan: They do exist.   
Question: If so, they must be somewhere. Where are they?   
Bhagavan: Persons who have seen them say that they exist somewhere. So we must  
accept their statement.   
Question: Where do they exist?   
Bhagavan: In you.   
Question: Then it is only idea  that which I can create and control?   
Bhagavan: Everything is like that.   
Question: But I can create pure fictions e.g., hares horn or only part  
truths, e.g. mirage, while there are also facts irrespective of my  
imagination. Do the gods Iswara or Vishnu exist like that?   
Bhagavan: Yes.   
( _Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi_, talk no. 30.)   
Question: What about Kailas and all the other worlds? Do they really exist?   
Bhagavan: All are the concoctions of maya.   
( _The Power of the Presence_, part one, p. 27.)   
Bhagavan: What is meant by moksha? Do the heavenly world and heavenly bliss  
exist somewhere in the sky? Are these to be experienced in some other body and  
in some other world after leaving this world and this body? The supreme world  
is only the Heart. Tranquillity in the form of supreme silence is supreme  
bliss, the happiness of liberation. Cessation of worries is the attainment of  
the supreme state. Through the state of being-consciousness, the life of  
supreme bliss can be attained at all times and in all states in this very  
world and in this very body.   
( _Sri Ramana Darsanam_, p. 62.)

Hello Rajan,   
You doubt is that pain cannot exist when this body/mind dies. Please note the  
following conversation with Bhagavan: Question: Then when we leave this body, that is when the ego leaves it, will  
it (the ego) immediately grasp another body? Bhagavan: Oh, yes, it must. It  
cannot exist without a body.   
Question: What sort of a body will it grasp then? Bhagavan: Either a physical  
body or a subtle-mental body.   
Question: Do you call this present physical body the gross body? Bhagavan: Only to distinguish it-to set it apart in conversation. It is really a subtle-  
mental body also.   
Subtle/Casual bodies also must have subtle/casual brains

Well.... It seem to me that the very important issue on your question is the  
WHY are you interested on it. What makes you, deep inside you, to be worried  
about it....? It does not matter whether hell or heaven really exist, but  
seems to me the important issue here is why are you worried about it...? What  
would be your reaction if you assume there is no heaven, nor hell...? And  
would be your reaction of you assume, believe, there is hell and heaven....?  
Why is it important....?

Hi ccpoax   
The existence of heaven and hell is a core point in nearly all religious  
beliefs. However, understandably, their existence cannot be proved or  
disproved empirically. Of course, one can choose to accept whatever has been  
laid down by the elders. But going against the grain of norm will open up new  
vistas of knowledge, be it in the spiritual or material spheres. Hence my  
question.

Dear Rajan,   
As long as we do not see or experience heven or hell we should not beleive in  
them.But certainly we exist & therefore we must try to abide in the pure  
awareness. Seeking to know hell or heven would dilute our effort towards  
knowing our true nature.

Thank you all for the enlightening views and quotes from Bhagawan.   
Let's assume a dreadful tyrant like Hitler dies and his soul is relegated to  
hell to suffer for the misdeeds. Eventually when the soul is reincarnated  
will the new self have to undergo suffering again?

As Bhagavan said on several occasions, the heaven and the hell   
are only in the mind, as this "jagat" (world) is in the mind. Still,   
if you want to know, when the body is lost, how can one feel   
the pleasure of heaven and pain of hell, the puranic answer is   
the mind and prana, which go out together, takes up a 'Yadana   
sarira" only to feel the pleasure and pain of the heaven and hell.   
I think you can stop with this answer and come back to Bhagavan's   
advice of keeping the Real within you and shedding all the unreal.

Dear rajan, sonagiri and others, the concept of hell and heaven is   
there in all religious beliefs. It is only for those who believe in such   
things. It is the mind, which causes, happiness, sorrow, pleasure,   
pain, good and evil. When the mind and breath leave the body, they   
also carry the latencies, vasanas, and it is the vasanas that cause a   
reibirth. If the mind is killed, there are no vasanas, there are no dyads and  
triads, no birth becuase one then merges in the Self and it is just is.   
Talking about Hitler, it is again a fevered imagination, to think as to   
what could have happened to him! Perhaps this mental exercise   
will result in thinking that he must have a suffered in hell, with his   
vasanas and a "yadana sarira', after which he must have been born as   
an AIDS virus, a shark, a poisonous serpent, a ferocious tiger or as   
Saddam Hussein or George Bush! Arunachala Siva.

Dear srkudai   
I understand what you are saying.   
But, I will try to clarify my situation as best I can. At a point in  
September, I was doing quiet well. Probably the best I've been in a long time,  
in many aspects of worldly and spiritual pursuits. Things -studying, cooking,  
activities- were happening almost effortlessly.   
Three weeks ago, some baggage was being felt, reaching a high point of a week  
ago.   
As you can see this is not about any discouraging thoughts and what not, this  
seems to be issues at a deeper level.   
I have resolved to drinking alcohol on a few nights this week, though I  
haven't for many months before.   
Anyway, its almost 5.30am here. I will be going to sleep soon.   
I don't know if this is a mind game that I'm playing with myself.   
Take care   
Laith

Dear Arunachala Siva   
My wish is not to abandon the duties expected, but the opposite.   
This seems to be difficult. Especially now.   
Laith   
P.S. I've read the poem you posted and it's inspiring.   
What I go through has been gone through and it is God's plan.   
I guess there is a feeling of guilt also inside of me, due to many unfulfilled  
expectations imposed on myself.

Dear Laith,   
Yes. .. it is a game your mind is playing with you.   
Need to come out of it.   
Please sleep early... avoid alcohol... and do your duties.   
Not doing these has nothing to do with spirituality or spiritual evolution.   
Above all... Know your thoughts and understand your inner lanscape. .. how  
thoughts/feelings/sensations are driving you... need to see them within.   
This is my advise as a friend... not someone here to criticize. .. but someone  
ever with you to support and help if sought.   
Love!   
Silence

I pray for your peace, and that you may return to the point in your middle  
soon...   
ken Wilber said: in the eye of the hurricane you are safe...   
It is very important to do the work you should do, you will feel much better  
if you are in tune with the plan of god (this means working, studding and  
whatever is happening in your life as a worldy duty)...   
No Alcohol Sir, Meditaiton and Drugs are two different worlds.....   
I guess you sit alot, so please go jogging..... and make some hatha yoga, a  
healthy body is easier to transcend   
drink alot of water to purify you, sometimes we do not have much energy  
because we do not drink water....this can make us frustrated and angry   
2 glass of water before every meal and 1 glass afterwards   
I wish you peace
