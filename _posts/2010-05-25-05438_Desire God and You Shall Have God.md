This is the mul mantra of Lord Ganesh (also called Ganapathi, Vinayaka,  
Vigneshwar). This mantra is said to have the power to remove all evil and  
obstacles.   
 **Origin of the mantra**   
This mantra was first mentioned in Ganapati Atharvarshisha. Ganapati  
Atharvarshisha is said to have been written by Atharva Rishi after he had the  
darshan of Ganapti.   
It is related to Lord Ganeshji. In simple words, it is mool mantra(basic  
chant) of Lord Ganesh.   
Om means universal sound, gam is invocation to Lords shakti (energy) and  
ganapatayae namah means bow to Lord of the world.   
 **What does it mean?**   
Om Gan Ganapatye Namah means the devotee bows/ offers salutations to the Lord  
of the World.   
 **How to pronounce it?**   
There are quite a few ways over how this mantra should be written, especially  
its second word gam. And various authorities stress over different  
pronunciations.   
Here are some ways of pronunciation: Om gan ganapatye namah   
Om gam ganapatye naman   
Om gung ganapatye namah   
Whatever the pronunciation, the meaning is always the same.   
This mantra removes all evil and obstacles that prevent you from reaching your  
goals.   
Chanting the mantra just after bath is very good or very early morning is  
extremely beneficial.

The master said, "My child, if you desire after God, God shall come to you."  
The disciple did not understand his master fully. One day both went to bathe  
in a river, and the master said, "Plunge in", and the boy did so. In a moment  
the master was upon him, holding him down. He would not let the boy come up.  
When the boy struggled and was exhausted, he let him go. **" Yes, my child,  
how did you feel there;" "Oh, the desire for a breath of air!" "Do you have  
that kind of desire for God?" "No, sir." "Have that kind of desire for God and  
you shall have God."   
-Swami Vivekananda.

Once in David Godman's blog, there were some heated discussions   
as to desiring the Self can be had by a seeker, since all desires   
are to be overcome. Eventually, Godman gave the verdict stating   
that desiring the Self is only the desire, a seeker could have according to  
Bhagavan Ramana.   
Arunachala Siva.

## ఓం నమో భగవతే శ్రీ రమణాయ It is foolish to shape the world, let us shape ourselves first

OFFER YOUR PLANS AND ACTIVITIES TODAY ACCORDING TO GOD"S WILL...   
DRISHTIKON-- PERCEPTION   
There was a millionaire who was bothered by severe eye pain. He consulted so  
many physicians and was getting his treatment done. He did not stop consulting  
galaxy of medical experts; he consumed heavy loads of drugs and underwent  
hundreds of injections.   
But the ache persisted with great vigor than before. At last a monk who has  
supposed to be an expert in treating such patients was called for by the  
millionaire.   
The monk understood his problem and said that for sometime he should  
concentrate only on green colors and not to fall his eyes on any other colors.   
The millionaire got together a group of painters and purchased barrels of  
green color and directed that every object his eye was likely to fall to be  
painted in green color just as the monk had directed.   
When the monk came to visit him after few days, the millionaire"s servants ran  
with buckets of green paints and poured on him since he was in red dress, lest  
their master not see any other color and his eye ache would come back.   
Hearing this monk laughed said "If only you had purchased a pair of green  
spectacles, worth just a few rupees, you could have saved these walls and  
trees and pots and all other articles and also could have saved a large share  
of your fortune.   
You cannot paint the world green." Let us change our vision and the world will  
appear accordingly.   
It is foolish to shape the world, let us shape ourselves first.   
Change Your Perception..!!   
 **KEEP CONFIDENCE, TRUST IN GOD AND NEVER LOSE HOPE...**
