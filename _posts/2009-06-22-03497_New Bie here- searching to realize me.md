I've been wanting to know the meaning of this life, and knowing me. As far as  
I read, one needs a proper guru to really understand about life, its existance  
et al. I've been searching for some guidance to enter the spiritual world  
where I can know 'who am I' and the purpose of this life.   
I think after reading about ramana maharishi, and his teachings, I think I  
found the master whose teachings, and knowing more about him will lead me to  
find the answers to all my questions about this life, and me.   
So, I just want to introduce myself to this forum. I'm from TN, but currently  
working in Bangalore. I'm planning to visit Arunachala soon - I don't know how  
soon - Bhagvan will let me know I guess.   
I'm interested to know how to book ashram rooms, and what are the few things I  
should take care before visiting. I think I will visit alone since I do not  
have much of friends who are just like me doing a soul-search-to-know-thyself.   
If anyone can provide me some information to me who is planning for a visit to  
the Hill for the first time in life, and start myself engaged in the teachings  
of Ramana, it would be of great help.   
Om Namashivaya! Arunachala Shiva!

Dear searchingme,   
I am very happy that you have finally arrived! The Guru's   
connections are not of one birth but they come through   
several births.   
I have written under Ashram and also under Arunachala,   
many details about going to Tiruvannamalai and staying   
in the Asramam guest house. If you can kindly go through   
some of these posts, you may get vivid idea about the place   
and Asramam and the proceedures. Kindly do it. In case   
you still have some doubts, I shall be able to clarify if I know   
the answers.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thank you Subramanian.R. I read some of your old posts, and got a very good  
information.   
I'm not sure when He gives me an order to visit him, but I'm sure it would be  
quite soon. I'm feeling that I should get a like-minded company, so that I can  
share thoughts, help each other.   
Also, I think that I need to read more about Sri Ramana, the divine Hill  
before visiting them, so that I know what are the places to visit, and all.  
Typically I'm planning to stay atleast for 3 days. If you have written about  
your stay already, can you please put the link of the forum here, if you don't  
mind?   
Also, can you recommend me some books to start reading? Again, I'm just a  
starter, and it is just a month where I started feeling more about Ramana, and  
his teachings, and it has only been a week I started reading all the posts in  
this forum, and in the internet. Can you also tell me some places in Bangalore  
which may sell books (both tamil, and english)?   
Thank you much in advance!   
anbe shivam!

Dear searching me,   
As regards Tiruvannamalai visit, I have gone for 5 times   
since May 2008 to May 2009. And each time, I have written   
a few posts under the headings: Sri Ramana Darshan   
Sri Arunachala Darshan   
The Hill of Fire   
Pilgrimage to Arunachala etc.,   
All these are available from the Forum posts under the title   
Teachings of Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi. You may kindly   
search them from May 2008 onwards. These have been written   
say, once in two or three months.   
As regards books: 1\. You may read Who am I? Nan Yar? if you can read Tamil.   
Read Question and Answer version, [the booklet is available   
at the incredibly low price of Rs 3.00!].   
2\. Then take up the essay version, which is priced at Rs 5.00!   
3\. You can take up then, the Complete Works of Sri Ramana   
Maharshi or Sri Ramana Nool Tirattu. Both are priced at   
Rs 50 each. The English translation is by Arthur Osborne   
improved over a period of time by great people like Prof.   
K. Swaminathan, J. Jayaraman and Dr. H. Ramamurthy.   
4. You can then take up three books which cover the prime   
period of Bhagavan Ramana's life, each for 4 prime years.   
These are:- 1\. Talks in English or Sri Bhagavad Vachanamritam in Tamil.  
Munagala Venkatramaiah / Sri Viswantha Swami.   
The Tamil version is available in 2 volumes. English version in one volume.  
These are priced Rs 100 apiece.   
2\. Day by Day with Bhagavan by Devaraja Mudaliar or   
Anudhinamum Bhagavanudan, in Tamil. These are available at Rs 75 each.   
3\. The last four years are covered by Letters from Sri   
Ramanasramam, Suri Nagamma, Sri Ramanachramathilirundhu   
Kadithangal in Tamil. These are available at Rs 150 each.   
Then you can take up many other books. There are at least   
20 other good books in English / Tamil. Ranging from   
The Teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi in His own words by   
Arthur Osborne to Maha Yoga by Lakshmana Sarma, WHO.   
You may also subscribe to Mountain Path, an English Quarterly of the Asramam.  
It costs annual subscription of Rs 120.00.   
It invariably contains wonderful articles on all related subjects of  
Bhagavan's teachings and advaita. Do notwait for company   
to go to Asramam. You may find some interesting people there inside the  
Asramam. A three day visit will be good enough. I have stayed 3 to 4 days  
each time.   
Wish you good luck in the Ramana Way. Remember the goal and   
the way are one and the same.   
Arunachala Siva.

Thank you so much for taking time to write a wonderful reply.   
Yes, probably I should be visiting the place alone.   
Do you know any place in Bangalore where I can buy these books? And, yes, I  
can read Tamil, and I would really like to read in Tamil since that's my  
mother tongue.   
Thanks again for your time!

Dear searchingme,   
Some books [both Tamil and English] are available in   
Sri Ramana Maharshi Heritage Centre, Near Post Office,   
Sanjay Nagar, Bangalore. You may check up there. They are usually having
