## Ganesa and Vittala  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 17, 2009, 12:23:38 PM  
---  
Namadev was a young child of about 5 years and one days,   
since his father was away at work and could not return till   
morning, his mother asked him, to take the offerings of   
roti, sabji, curd bath and payasam to Vittala and do nivedhana   
after puja. When Namadev said that he could not do puja   
his mother told him: It does not matter. You say Hari Rama   
Krishna Hari a few times and then offer the nivedhana. The   
child Namadev went to the shrine and offered the nivedhana.   
He thought Vittala would take a portion of it and when Vittala   
did not take anything, he started crying and was about to   
bang his head on the feet of the stone image. Vittala who   
normally keeps his hands on his hip, took out his hands and   
stopped Namadev and spoke to him and also both the god   
and the child shared the entire food! When Namadev returned   
home, his mother could not believe the story. She started shouting at the  
child. Vittla came to mother's dream and   
explained.   
There is an identical story about Nambi Andar Nambi. He   
hailed from Tiru Naraiyoor, near Thanjavur. His father   
was a Ganesa Upasaka, [Gaanapatyam] and used to offer   
to Swayambu Vinayakar [PoLLa Pillaiyar in Tamil, polla   
means not touched by the sculptor's instruments] daily.   
One day he was again from village and Nambi Andar Nambi   
went in his father's place. After puja, Vinayaka did not   
take the nivedhana and when the child cried, Vinayaka extended his trunk and  
took the food along with the child. This Nambi Andar Nambi later became the  
famous saint-poet who elaborated on the song of 63 Saints by Sundaramurthy   
Swamigal [Tiru Thondar Thohai] and made a longer poem   
of the list titled Tiru Thondar Tiru Andati. This is more detailed and is in  
the metre of Muktapada Sthavam. These two poems were the base on which  
Sekkizhar wrote the famous Periya Puranam. Nambi Andar Nambi first worte a  
poem on Swayambu Ganapati of Tiru Naraiyur, as thanksgiving. All his poems  
are found in Book XI of Saiva Canons.   
Later Tukaram, in his abangam has sung Vinayaka is Vittala, and perhaps he  
must have heard these two incidents.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Four Great Saiva Saints  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 17, 2009, 03:24:57 PM  
---  
As you may be aware, Tiru Jnana Sambandhar, Tiru Navukkarasar, Sundaramurthy  
and Manikkavachagar are   
the four great saints of Saivism. Each one has been taken   
control of by Siva in a different way.   
One Tamil poem says, they were shown Pal, Sool, Olai   
and Kal.   
Pal means milk in Tamil. For Tiru Jnana Sambandhar,   
[who is an avatara of Skanda, the last avatara being   
Bhagavan Ramana], was taken control of by Siva by   
Uma giving milk, when the saint was three years old,   
in Seerkazhi.   
Sool means colic pain. For Tirunavukkarasar, was taken   
control of by Siva, by giving him the colic pain, when he   
was a convert Jain in Kanchipuram.   
Olai means a palmyra leaf. For Sundaramoorthy, Siva   
came in disguise with a palmyra leaf, which said the   
saint is a slave for him. He thus stopped his marriage,   
took him to Tiruvennainallur where Siva disappeared   
into the temple as a bright light!   
Kal means legs. For Manikkavachagar, Siva showed his   
legs in Tiru Kazhu Kundram [or Tiruvidaimaruthur] as   
an old brahmin, under Kurunda tree. Manikkavachagar   
held his Guru's legs and became a devotee and saint.   
Bhagavan Ramana was taken control of by Siva by the   
word Arunachalam through a relative of Bhagavan Ramana   
when he was 15 years old! Arunachalam was the word.   
Bhagavan describes this in Arunachala Ashtakam, Verse 1.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Purandara Dasa's carefree state  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 17, 2009, 01:33:53 PM  
---  
Purandara Dasa sings in one of his compositions, a Ninda   
Stuti, which reads as under:-   
O Vittala, who is care-free in this world, you or me?   
You have got the whole world to take care.   
I have none because I have left everything in your care.   
At nights you are afraid of thieves, because you wear   
 gold and precious gems.   
What do I wear, excepting Tulsi garland, why should I   
 be afraid of thieves?   
You have to safeguard the cows and calves in this world.   
What do I care? I sleep at the tree shade and my cows   
 and calves are safe with you.   
You have to vanquish all the rakshasas of this world.   
For me, I am myself a rakshasa, if I vanquish me [ego]   
 it is adequate.   
Who is more carefree you or me, O Vittala!   
Bhagavan Ramana also sings in Arunachala Padigam, Verse   
9, in somewhat similar vein.   
O Primordial God, I am the poorest in Knowledge, among   
 such poors.   
It is your care you should take care of me, who has come to   
 you. What weight is heavy for you?   
Let me not carry this load of world on my head by leaving you,   
 it is enough for me.   
O Primordial Arunachala! Kindly do not forsake me from your   
 feet!   
Saint Manikkavachagar sings in Tiruvachakam, Kovil   
Tirupadigam., Verse 10: You have given me to you, and you have taken me to you,   
Who is cleverer amongst us?   
I am getting endless bliss, what do you gain from me?   
You have taken abode in my Heart, O Lord of Tiruperundurai.   
O my father you have taken my body as your Temple   
What in recompense can I give to you?   
All Jnanis have the same bhava in their poetry.   
Arunachala Siva.
