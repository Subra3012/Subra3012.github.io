Yoga Vasishtam contains a mention of the 4 most important practices: 1\. Self Inquiry   
2\. Sat Sangha   
3\. Vairagya   
4\. Contentment, Shanti or Peaceful living.   
If a person cannot practice all these, let him practice any one and it would  
eventually lead him to all the others three.   
Infact, sat sangha is that which develops vairagyam, self inquiry and peaceful  
nature. without vairagyam peaceful living is impossible. without self inquiry  
vairagyam cannot mature. hence all these practices are just 4 names for the  
same thing.   
maintain any one of these attitudes and the rest will automatically follow.  
the progress will also be fast.

Satsangathve nissangatvam [through sat sangam, one understands that there is  
none else, so one becomes without any company]   
nissangatve nirmohatvam [when one sees that there is none else, no other  
company, one becomes without moha. one's delusion is destroyed]   
nirmohatve nischala tatvam [once delusion is destroyed, one becomes stillness]   
nischala tatve jivan muktihi [Stillness is liberation ]
