In America, the full moon will occur on July 18th at 4am......   
Anyone know when it occurs in India... and what night would be best to do  
pradiksha, the night of the 17th, or the night of the 18th?   
thanks!

Dear Blissboy, the Full Moon in India is observed from   
17th morning 12.57 PM to 18th afternoon 2.00 PM. You may   
accordingly readjust this to your local American time and observe.   
The full moon is seen bright at Tiruvannamalai on 17th night!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, there is only one Master. He is not known to us, nor   
can he be seen or touched by us. This Master, the Causeless Cause,   
causes many masters in different times, as times demand. These   
masters are 'avataras', who are equally capable to take the seekers   
in the path and show the goal. Remember, the Master can only show the   
goal and it is for you to reach it merge with it. Please read Who am I?   
by Bhagavan written in 1902, at the age of 21. The Master need not   
be living in a body and it is left to you to call him, Sadguru, Parama Guru,   
Parameshti Guru, or Brahma Guru. After all, what is there in a name?   
Bhagavan also has said that the seeker can know the Guru is he   
gets immense peace in his presence or through his books, his words,   
his name etc., Arunachala Siva.

Dear sir   
I was told that the person who gives and shows the path he is a teacher or  
guide. whereas the Master will give   
real experience there and then which never fades away. It is the ultimate. In  
front of Bhagavan many were so fortunate even people did not know what is  
meditation or sadhana. Same thing happened to Vivekananda with Ramakrishna  
paramahamsa. It depends on our luck to have such a Master in our live time. As  
Subramaniyan ji told Bhagavan's books are there for us to show the path.

Dear Ramanaduli, I used the word Master, to indicate the Adi-Guru,   
Sri Dakshinamoorthy. The word can also be used for a Guru who   
is a Brahma-Jnani. As you rightly said, teachers give scriptural knowledege  
only, the Jnana Guru confers liberation, with or without scriptural knowledge.  
In Ramanasramam, the Guru-paramapra is chanted as: Sri Dakshinamoorthy  
prarambe, Sankaracharya madhyame,   
Sri Ramana Guru. Skanda, the son of Siva, is called Parama Guru,   
the one who taught the pravana mantra purport to Siva Himself!   
In Sri Ramana Gita, Bhagvan says to Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni: The Guru is one in whose Presence you get immense peace.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramani ji   
I am very happy to know there is another dhiksha that is mono dhiksha. These  
replies are giving courage and guidence   
to do further. Once again I thank you, srkudhai and Dr. Raju ji. Bhagavan  
gives very tough test paper everyday. With His grace only I could overcome all  
the obstecles without loosing my awarness. Bhagavan took avatar like  
Dhakshnamoorthy   
He IS available to all the beings. Those who got their realisation were all  
fully dried sticks so as soon as the Jnanan agani   
Fell on'" it got burned. In my case I am still like a wet wood. The stick  
which I use' Pinam chudm kazhli', it gets burned so fast. leaving my thoughts   
If everything goes smoothly I feel I am with my SELF. Once I get problem, I  
will loose "self".

Dear Ramanduli, Bhagavan Ramana's life was the personification   
of silence and Sri Dakshinamoorthy. He taught as was done by   
the Adi Guru, in silence. Mouna vaakya... The sincere seekers   
understood the Self, Para Brahma Tattvam.... They had all their   
doubts cleared without asking for any clarification. Sishyashtu   
Chinna samsaya.....Dakshina also means in Sanskrit, the right side.   
Bhagavan always sat with His chin turned slightly towards right.   
If one stays in the South, and sees the Guru, who is the Spiritual   
North Pole, who is seeing the Southern direction, (dakshinam), and looks   
at Him and then on one's right, one will see the East. The East is where the  
Sun rises. The Sun of Knowledge can be experienced if you turn towards the  
north and then look at your rigtht side.   
One of the 108 Holy Names of Bhagavan, one is: Sri Dakshinabhi mukayai Namah: Arunachala Siva.

to do further. Once again I thank you, srkudhai and Dr. Raju ji. Bhagavan  
gives very tough test paper everyday. With His grace only I could overcome all  
the obstecles without loosing my awarness. Bhagavan took avatar like  
Dhakshnamoorthy   
He IS available to all the beings. Those who got their realisation were all  
fully dried sticks so as soon as the Jnanan agani   
Fell on'" it got burned. In my case I am still like a wet wood. The stick  
which I use' Pinam chudm kazhli', it gets burned so fast. leaving my thoughts   
If everything goes smoothly I feel I am with my SELF. Once I get problem, I  
will loose "self".

Dear Ramanduli, Bhagavan Ramana's life was the personification   
of silence and Sri Dakshinamoorthy. He taught as was done by   
the Adi Guru, in silence. Mouna vaakya... The sincere seekers   
understood the Self, Para Brahma Tattvam.... They had all their   
doubts cleared without asking for any clarification. Sishyashtu   
Chinna samsaya.....Dakshina also means in Sanskrit, the right side.   
Bhagavan always sat with His chin turned slightly towards right.   
If one stays in the South, and sees the Guru, who is the Spiritual   
North Pole, who is seeing the Southern direction, (dakshinam), and looks   
at Him and then on one's right, one will see the East. The East is where the  
Sun rises. The Sun of Knowledge can be experienced if you turn towards the  
north and then look at your rigtht side.   
One of the 108 Holy Names of Bhagavan, one is: Sri Dakshinabhi mukayai Namah: Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, as I posted elsewhere, the Guru is one in whose   
presence, (his books, his words, his name), the seeker gets   
total peace and gets all his doubts resolved, without questioning.   
There is no qualification like, living or dead, man or   
woman, young or old. Even the Guru can be a bird and not a   
human being! Please see Avadhuta Gita. Arunachala Siva.

Dear nonduel, your two posts. Scriptures mention three types of   
'dikshas' that is, Sparsa diksha, Sakshu diksha, Mano-diksha   
or Bhavana diksha. The first is by touch, like hen touching the egg   
for hatching. The second is by look, like fish looking at the eggs. The   
third is by thinking, like tortoise thinking about the eggs on the shore.   
Bhagavan used sparsa diksha very rarely. He used looking more   
often. Kayvya kanta Muni has said: "Do not sit directly before the   
Bhagavan! If He looks at you, the hrudaya kranthi (the knots) gets   
snapped immediately and you will not go back to your family!" In 108   
holy names on Bhagavan, there are names Pullambuja Vilochanaya Namah,   
that is one who looks at others with eyes like red lotuses. Again,   
Uttheepata Nayanaya Namah, one who has got a look like piercing   
arrow! Bhagavan used mano diksha or bhavana diksha very rarely.   
(Do not ask how can He think?). The first two were used when He   
was in body. The third one, He uses even today. But the third one is   
a two way process. If one thinks of Him, He will think of him. If one   
has conviction (Bhavana), He will have the bhavana on him. Hence   
there is no need for Bhagavan (or any Guru) to be in body. His   
Presence (Sannidhya) will do but this requires our thinking and   
conviction. The only test is whether you get peace.   
Avdhuta Gita, the English translation of Ramakrishna Math is   
excellent. For that matter, all advaita books of Ramakrishna Math   
are quite good.   
I have not read "No mind, I am the Self." Hence I cannot write about   
Sri Lakshmanaswami's book.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear nonduel, on Avadhuta Gita. I mentioned about Avadhuta having   
several gurus (24 beings) which included a bird. This story is not   
available in Avadhuta Gita. I am sorry. Avadhuta or Dattatreya is   
the son of Sage Atri and Anasuya. He had 24 gurus and a vulture was   
one of his gurus. He saw a vulure flying with a piece of meat on its   
beak, and several vultures chased it to grab the meat. The bird   
decided to drop it and lo and behlold, after dropping the meat,   
all other birds left it. Avadhuta learned that once you leave your   
possesions, nobody will come near you. Thus he held the bird as   
his guru! The story appears in Markendaya Purana. There are also   
books narrating Dattatreya Charitra. About Avadhuta Gita per se,   
which is a pure advaita text, without stories, I shall write separately.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear nonduel, Thinking about Bhagavan's frame and repeating His   
name was never discouraged by Bhagavan. But He has said that   
the Brahman is beyond forms and names. But many of us have to   
start only from a name-form worship or contemplation to reach the   
formless worship or contemplation or meditation. Hence this   
allowance. But I still maintain the stand that the Guru need not   
be in a physical body nor he should be a human being. One can   
"see" the Brahman as much as in a hill and in a bird. I propose   
write to David Godman about Sri Lakshmanaswami's saying that   
the Guru should be in a living body. When I get a reply, I shall   
post it. Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sankar, I am happy that Bhagavan is appearing in your dream.   
I had that fortune only on one or two occasions. But kindly do not   
wait for the dream, sleep etc., Please visualize Him in the wakeful   
state, either mentally or through a photograph of Him. The Guru   
will push you inside from the out and the Guru inside your Heart will   
also pull you from inside into the Heart. That is the starting point for

Dear nonduel, I am thankful to you for your extrace of David   
Godman's interview with Sri Lakshmanaswami. Both David and   
Sri Lakshmanaswami agree about three types of gurus, Siva within,   
Siva appearing in the name of a guru for a while and the living gurus,   
who are Siva's devotees who are designed to be teachers. In fact,   
in the case of Saint Manikkavachagar, Siva appeared as a Guru for   
a while, in the place called Tirukkazhukundram, and disappeared later.   
Manikkavachagar's life is a wonder. First Siva appeared before him as   
an Effulgent light in a place called Tirupperundurai in Southern Tamil Nadu.  
The Siva appeared as a brahmin guru in Tirukkazhukundram and Manikka-   
vachagar became Self-realized, sang songs in a number of places, and   
finally merged in Siva, again as a light merging with light in Chidambaram.   
Coming to your point, from your posts I guess you need a living guru   
to clarify your doubts about Ramana Way. If this so, there are several   
elders inside Ramanasramam, and David Godman through his website.   
Finding a living guru firstly it may be difficult and secondly you are not   
sure whether they are genuine, in these days of bogus and self-styled   
gurus.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear nonduel, Thanks for your immediate response. The story   
mentioned by you has also been read from somewhere sometime   
back. Upanishads mention two preconditions for a Guru, one,   
he should be a through scholar in "sastras", that is, scriptures   
and injunctions; second he must be a Bramha Nishta, that is   
he should abiding in Brhaman or the Self. The phrase goes: "Stotriam Brahma-nishtam." In today's world, we have scholars   
aplenty and what is rare is brahma-nishta, gurus abiding in the   
Self. The King in the story is having both qualifications, he is   
able to order and also he has got authority to do so. Whereas   
the other is giving only an order, but has no authority. Hence   
the order of the second was not obeyed. If one could find a   
living guru who has order and authority, there is nothing like   
that. But it is very very rare, and it is like finding the footprints   
of the bird on the sky!   
You are correct. I checked up with David Godman's blog. Sri   
Lakshmana Swami has in fact, suggested the need for a living   
Guru. But he had Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi but do we have one?   
Arunachala Siva.

About 12 years ago I called myself and atheist I was full of hate even for God  
which is strange for an atheist! then over night something changed I was  
filled with an energy to find why I am here to find out if there was something  
more. I started reading Paul Brunton's books in which I first heard of Ramana.  
My point is who was my Guru if not the self?   
When I think of Ramana my heart is filled with love and no words will do. If  
someone tells me I need a living Guru I will tell them I have Ramana I have  
the self.

Dear "kide", I am happy you have started reading Paul Brunton.   
Read other books on Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi and also books   
by Him. During the stage of practice, you need a Guru and Bhagavan   
Ramana's photograph or His books will be your Guru. Once the practice   
is completed, you are the Self, at which time, there is no need for   
a Guru, since there is no duality, inside and outside. At that time the   
Self, that is Bhagavan Ramana will shine in all its brilliance and you   
are That. Be as you are.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear kdo, regarding other books, you may read Aruthur Osborne's   
Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi's teachings in His own words.   
You may David Godman's The Power of the Presence. 3 vols.   
Sri Ramansramam has recently brought out a seven volume   
compendium on Bhagavan called The Life and Teachings of Bhagavan   
Sri Ramana Maharshi. It is brought out both in English and in Tamil.

Dear Friends,   
 suppose i ask : Do you require a guru for getting knowledge of mathematics? The answer is yes and no. Yes, coz in the absence of a Guru, one may misunderstand. No coz, if a good book is available we might as well understand with self effort and sincerity.   
While this is so for intellectual subjects -- most people seem to think that  
Guru will solve their problems. This is totally wrong. There is this saying  
that if the load is on our head, someone can remove it; but if the load is in  
our head no one can do it for us, we will have to do it ourselves. How to  
unload the mind, we might need some instructions. For example, if someone  
thinks that "Who am i" needs to be repeated, for such a person, someone needs  
to tell him that is not the way. But a sincere Sadhaka can study carefully and  
interact with people like David Godman and find out its true meaning.   
But i think Sri Ramana's books convey the meaning very clearly and would be  
sufficient for us. And these discussions are also ways to interact and get  
things clearer.   
Love!

Dear srkudai, I agree with you. Dear Sankar and srkudai,   
a guru is one who teaches the arts and sciences. Like   
the maths teacher, or Drona who taught archery to Arjuna.   
These people are for worldly knowledge. A Satguru, as the   
name implies, lives in Sat, Brahman, and teaches you how   
to merge in Him.   
As for living and dead gurus, the controversy is still open.   
As for me, Bhagavan Ramana will do and I do not need   
anybody 'living'.

Dear Friends,   
 While selecting modern living gurus please be cautious. If we select someone and the person proves out to be a fraud it is lot of sorrow. We need to be very cautious to see every move of the person before calling him a guru.   
My way is, i pick what ever is correctly said, no matter who says it ask  
doubts and get clarifications : ultimately, i treat no one as guru in ultimate  
sense, but everyone from whom i learnt a new perspective or way is a guru so  
to say. But someone who taught me something vital, if he proves out to be a  
fraud, i wont feel let down, as i took his teaching and not everything aspect  
of his life. This would make sure we wont get let down by personal defects of  
the teacher.   
Love!

I-am-the-body idea is the primal ignorance.It is the vritti on which all other  
vrittis arise and so dependent on it.   
Once the mind tastes the self-knowledge there is formation of Atmakara vritti  
or Brahmakara vitti which strengthens   
day by day with spiritual practice which finally annihilates "I-am-the-body-  
idea" along with it's progeny of other vrittis.   
Once "I-am-the-body-idea" is annihilated there is spontaneous revelation of  
the ultimate reality.   
Annihilation of "I-am-the-body-idea"amounts to killing of the ego.If it is not

Dear Sankar, Bhagavan said two things, one is vichara and another   
is surrender. In both, the ego has to be annihilated. In vichara, you   
enquire within, with no thoughts, ego et all and merge in the Self.   
In surender, He meant a total surrender and a conditional surrender.   
When someone came to Bhagavan saying that he is a great sinner,   
Bhagavan said, 'then give all your sins to me and surrender without   
any qualms'. If this can happen, then it is total surrender, where also   
the ego is totally destroyed. In sum the purpose of life is to kill the   
mind and the ego either way, vichara or saranagati. Arunachala Siva.

When the basic form of exclusive self consciousness is mixed with adjuncts a  
seemingly compound consciousness appear which imagines itself to be a body so  
distorts the   
self conscious being "I am" to a limited object knowing consciousness which we  
commonly call as the mind or ego.The act of directing our consciousness  
towards something that appears other than ourself is what we call thinking.All  
objects come into existence only because of act of knowing them.Thoughts and  
images arise in our mind,they are formed by action of thinking or imagining  
them,an action that can occur only when we allow our attention to move  
seemingly away from ourself.   
Self-enquiry directs our attention selfwards and there no oscillation of  
attention and consciousness is concentrated in the core of our being as self  
consciousness.In this state of being ego is found to be nonexistent and the  
question of killing a nonexistent entity does not arise.

i'm not guilty for having no verdicts   
my discourses rivers are flowing upwards   
my temples and libraries as if made of cards   
suddenly burst into laughing at once   
i'm not guilty, not afraid anymore   
a lie does not trouble my soul as before   
i'm no longer ironic to Love   
let It break down, let It blow up   
whatever - i used to believe  was decent   
whatever  i thought  was my realization   
whatever i  i thought -- was exactly myself   
no comment  just ego annihilation

All the best. Try your hard practice of self enquiry with deep devotion and  
dedication with purity of heart.   
Dont forget the trio PATIENCE, PERSISTENT, TOLERANCE   
Id like to try --   
But why, but why?   
You tell me how    
Im happy now.   
Can ego kill the ego? No.   
My Lord just smiled and let it go.

Dera SANKAR,   
Can a thorn be removed not by _another_ thorn but by itself?

yes dear   
so it becomes one as I   
siva siva   
 I don't wish it happens, but   
are you really ready to remove a thorn by the same thorn   
when you might get a splinter in your foot?

If a thorn stitches it needs to be removed by a sharp pin. But how it was done  
before pin was discovered.   
That is the way.  
Are you sure you have a thorn in your foot? May be it's just an imaginary  
thorn?

Dear Vladimir and everyone, all these thorn discussions are   
futile. There is no thorn. We 'think' that there is a thorn,   
and we 'think' some other thorn will remove it.

I-am-the-body idea is the primal ignorance.It is the vritti on which all other  
vrittis arise and so dependent on it.   
Once the mind tastes the self-knowledge there is formation of Atmakara vritti  
or Brahmakara vitti which strengthens   
day by day with spiritual practice which finally annihilates "I-am-the-body-  
idea" along with it's progeny of other vrittis.   
Once "I-am-the-body-idea" is annihilated there is spontaneous revelation of  
the ultimate reality.   
Annihilation of "I-am-the-body-idea"amounts to killing of the ego.If it is not  
annihilated self-ignorance perpetuates   
with it's consequent misery.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, Bhagavan has even said: "What is   
Aham-kara-vritti? In Aham, there is no 'karam' doing or   
there is no 'vritti' or expansion or elaboration!   
Arunachala Siva.
