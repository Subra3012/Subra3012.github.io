Those who are serious about meditative enquiry may stop watching TV and see  
the effect on the mind after a couple of months.   
Om Shanti. ..

Dear Silentgreen   
This is a great challenge to everyone in this forum. Has anyone practiced not  
watching the TV?   
When I learnt Yoga for some days, my teacher advised us not to watch TV for  
that period and watch the difference for ourselves. Though I watch TV very  
minimally for that period, I could still see its effects. It helped me be  
focussed with my sadhana. No obstacles could affect me.   
Let me try this out. Tomorrow I will try not to watch TV for the whole day.  
Just a small way to begin this Sadhana.   
Nagaraj

Like books, TV time has also been reduced by me drastically. I watch   
two half-an-hour programmes everyday in the evening. One programme is Periya  
Puranam, a discourse by Smt. Parimalam,   
in Sankara TV. Another is Where is Brahmin? in Jaya TV. No news,   
no dances, no serials, no cinemas.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear munagala,   
Cricket is a great menace that is afflicting Indian citizens. I am   
very happy about IPL shifting the Twenty-Twenty matches to   
South Africa. It would have been better if they had shifted it   
to Arctic Sea, where some penguins, pelicans and Eskimos might   
watch the matches.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear munagala,   
Yes it is correct. There was one Sadhu in Arunachala, who was   
addicted to Ganja habit. It helped him in his meditation. Siva   
finally appeared before him. The Sadhu exclaimed: "O Annamalai!   
You have come! I am ready. Please wait a minute, I shall pick up   
my Ganja pocket and then proceed with You!"   
Arunachala Siva.

Then How harder it should be to give up our Ego?   
How much time it takes to break a habit formed in this birth?   
Then how much would it take to break habits of all our births put together.   
Always remember the 3Ps.   
Ah, beautiful point. It's almost demotivational sometimes to try and quit one  
thing when you realize that unless you quit the quitter you've quit nothing.  
And even then it's perhaps not something "you" do but rather something that  
happens to you when you see deeply enough the actual state of affairs.

Dear prasanth,   
Cricket got undue importance because of the money that is flowing   
in and out of the system. How many foot-ball matches are taking   
place right now. The World Cup is going on. But no one in India   
seems to talk about it at length. In fact 1/ 1/2 hrs of foot ball   
is much more a difficult task than a 1 day game of Cricket. Then,   
how about Hockey, which is our national sport? No one bothers.   
Arunachala Siva.

Subramanian Garu,   
As bhagavan ramana says people want to do things which get them more  
happiness.   
Maybe our indians get more happiness watching/playing cricket rather than any  
sport. :-)   
But as for me every sport is time waste to watch atleast it is better i feel  
to play for sometime so that we may get some sort of physical exercise.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Its like a person playing role in a Drama. The person unfortunately is getting  
identified with the character he is playing.   
Naturally he cannot enjoy the roles he is playing. He cannot stop playing.   
I was studying Sri Ramana's commentry on Vivekachudamani its beautiful.  
Ramana explains: Abide as the Self.   
Please see. .. The rememberance that i am the Self playing this role of a  
"Software Engineer", with a "wife", with parents and a brother of someone etc  
... this is the role. .. and i am the consciousness in whose presence the role  
is happening. Thus seeing that the body is a grab that is picked up for the  
role... i do not have a body.   
The rememberance is very important. When we forget this that is when the  
problem is.   
For the one who has no conviction. .. who does not see himself as  
consciousness unaffected by the happenings: who thinks he is getting affected  
by the happenings, it is important to see the mind and how we ourselves are  
getting into the thoughts and thoughts cannot touch us without our wrong  
identification. This leads to conviction that i am the Self and that leads to  
firm Abidence in it.   
Japa, Prayer, Meditation are useful. .. but a person can go on doing it life  
long without understanding that he is the Self. .. and such a person will not  
find liberation... unless he learns that he is the Self.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear everyone,   
Japa, prayer and meditation are all aids to self enquiry, because   
these bring about one thought of the Godhead, instead of many   
thoughts which slowly weaken but spread more and more. This   
is as per Who am I?. Ekakrita is obtained through such activities,   
and it helps to do self enquiry. To say that japa, prayer and meditation   
are not required is like doing pole vault without the pole!   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Please do not worry. Not much water has flown since your last   
operation. You have come back from US, and you have to get   
re-acclimatize to the Indian diaspora. There are powercuts,   
there are voltage fluctuations, and there are breakdowns which   
are not set right for days and weeks.   
Arunachala Siva.
