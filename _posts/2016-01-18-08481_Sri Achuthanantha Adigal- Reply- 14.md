When the erection of "panchakshara medai" (the platform on which the chanting  
of Na-ma-si-va-ya is done)   
began, people who had heard of the state of the gracious form and the sweat on  
the forehead of Swamigal's   
body, came in large numbers, requesting ardently that the samadhi pit be  
opened again for their darshan and   
prayer. When the disciples gently refused to open it as it was late in the  
evening and the construction activity   
had to be completed, the crowd which had gathered became agitated and tried to  
force open the samadhi   
pit. The disciples were stunned and did not know what to do, when suddenly  
there was a heavy downpour   
and the crowd dispersed as there was no shelter from the rain. The  
construction was thus completed in the   
prescribed time period.   
Though the reason for the condition of Swamigal's physical form was discussed  
among the wise ones no one   
could explain it. Later on, at one of the aradhana festivals of Swamigal,  
K.Dadivelu Chettiyar, a Vedanta   
guru who had the darshan of Bhagavan, was the guest of honor. When he was  
informed of the condition of   
Swamigal's body, he explained that one who is well versed in yogic practices,  
can hold the breath and stay in   
the akanda samadhi, that is, stay for a very long time in a thoughtless  
breathless state. Adigal being a Jnana   
siddha, one who has reached the summit of Jnana, as well as yoga siddha, one  
who has reached the summit   
of yogic practices, is in the state of jeeva samadhi and hence there is no  
change in condition of the body.   
Later, two brothers who were disciples of Swamigal, Sri Mandiramoorthy Pillai  
and Sri Vaithyalingam Pillai,   
took great pains and at great expense built a temple and Mutt, and arranged  
for the kumbhabishekam and   
oversaw the general activities of the new temple and the Mutt. In time, the  
Mutt was rebuilt and renamed   
Achyuta Nilayam. The Mutt is still active today and may be visited on the  
Tiruvannamalai -Polur -Vellore   
highway (National Highway 234). It is some 30 kms from Polur or some 67 kms  
from Tiruvannamalai on the   
road to Vellore. It is located at Kizhvallam which is about a km. before  
Kannamangalam. There is a bridge   
there and one immediately turns left.   
concluded.   
Arunachala Siva.
