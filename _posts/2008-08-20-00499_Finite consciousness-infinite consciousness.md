## Finite consciousness-infinite consciousness

When we know that mind with finite consciousness can know only finite  
things,why are we trying to comprehend infinite self-conscious being with  
it.Is it not a futile exercise?

Dear Raju, the mind is finite consciousness and the Self is   
infinite consciousness. They are like the two sides of a coin.   
"When the mind is seen, the Brahman is not seen. When   
the Brahman is seen, (shines), the mind is not seen. "   
(Who am I?"). Bhagavan says again, in Who am I? : "The Real is Atma Swarupa. The Jagat, Isvara and the   
individual soul are all imaginations."   
I told David Godman, that Who am I? alone is adequate   
for understanding Self-Enquiry. All other books are details.   
David agreed that Who am I alone is adequate for a sincere   
'sadhak'. Many devotees incuding a European have started   
practising Self Enquiry with Who am I?. This European has   
said in 1940s that this book is adeaquate for him and refused   
to take any other books from the Ashram. When Bhagavan   
said Who am I? for Sivaprakasam Pillai in 1902, He was just 21!   
That is why, He is called the Brahman and we are all jivas,   
and we are going round and round, like Gopis went round   
Krishna. With His abundant Grace, we shall have union   
with Him one day. The way in which I have been quoting   
Who am I? I believe that this is true.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Raju,   
 I think mind cannot contain any "actual" object.   
For example "Rose" \ mind only stores a pointer, the image of the rose and  
the name.   
for everything there is only a pointer.   
"Who am I" is a pointer for the Self   
or "Brahman" is a pointer for the Self.   
Clearly it does not store the Self. As even it does not store even a Rose.   
Love!   
Silence

Dear 'srkudai', Yes. The mind carries only the thoughts, and   
not physical objects. That is why the mind is a bundle of thoughts,   
the "sukshuma rupa". Bhagavan says in Who am I?, Mind carries   
"the breath", which is mind's 'sthula rupa'.   
For that matter, all the senses carry only formelsss objects, the   
tongue, the sweetness of halwa, the nose, the fragrance of   
jasmin, the eye, the beauty of a girl, the ear, the sweetness of   
the voice of M.S. Subbalaksmi, the skin, the feeling of a warm   
bed on a cold night etc., They do not 'carry' the objects per se.   
Again, Who am I? - Bhagavan's first work does not leave me!   
Arunachala Siva.
