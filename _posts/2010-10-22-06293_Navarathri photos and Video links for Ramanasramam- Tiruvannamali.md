Dear prasanth,   
I could see all the photographs from Day 1, Meenakshi to Day 9,   
Mahishasuramardini. They are quite nice, taking us to the Mother's   
temple and the celebrations for the 9 days, though we are somewhere   
else. The videos did not work properly in my comp.

Once during Bhagavan Ramana 's time, on a Saraswati Puja Day   
[Maha Navami], the devotees had arranged the books on a table   
near Bhagavan Ramana's couch and they had done puja and placed   
flowers, and turmeric mixed rice etc., on the books. Bhagavan   
Ramana was as usual sitting and devotees were also there.   
When Muruganar came a little late and entered the Hall he observed   
the books and Bhagavan Ramana. Then, he said: When the sugarcanes are  
crushed, its juice solidified and made into an idol, --   
so Bhagavan Ramana is sitting here. The crushed sugar canes   
are kept nearby, with flowers and turmeric mixed rice! Everyone   
appreciated the poem written thereafter. Bhagavan Ramana said: The books are also important. Are they not giving us the juice first,   
whether one becomes a sugar doll or not.
