Why had widows to be burnt with their husbands in India?   
Is the idea that a woman exists solely to serve her husband really found in  
the Vedas?   
What did Bhagavan say about these subjects?

Dear Jyoti,   
How come you understand everything incorrectly? The widowed wives voluntarily  
entered the funeral pyre since they   
believed that it would give them salvation. But in course of time, when they  
were unwilling also and had desire to live,   
they were forced to jump into the pyre. This is where the trouble started.  
However all these things are things of past.   
Nowadays no wife after widowhood jumps into pyre. Either they live a spartan  
life and complete their life in the world   
or if they are young, they remarry as in West. If there are children, they  
concentrated on rearing up the children.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Sriswaroop,   
I agree with you. Some of these practices were adopted in the ancient times  
with a purpose. But in course of time, the original   
purpose is lost. Because the world is deteriorating. The temple priests who  
are brahmins are smoking cigarettes and are eating   
in non vegetarian food. Some Jesuit fathers have been caught up in the act of  
homosexuality. Recently one Swami N. was videoed   
having sex with a woman.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear sreeswaroop,   
Firstly, the priests of the temple should be employed in full time basis with  
a decent salary. Now that the   
government has taken over the temple administration, they should see to it  
that these priests are decently   
paid and on the condition that they should not do any other work, excepting  
teaching Vedas and Upanishads   
and other scriptures to willing students, when there is no temple work.   
Secondly, regarding appointments, the so called secular policy should not come  
in the way of appointments.   
Brahmins alone are qualified for the work and they alone should be appointed.  
But even these brahmins should\   
have good character and conduct. Can you see any administration of mosques or   
Walf Boards managed by non-Moslems? Why only for Hindu temples?   
Secondly, due to first and second, they will naturally not indulge in eating  
other than vegetarian food and resort to   
smoking or drinking. Traditionally chewing pan and betal nuts by householders  
are not prohibited. No tobacco please.   
So when priests are householders, they do these pan chewing in their homes and  
not inside or outside temples.   
When I say the world is deteriorating, I only discreetly pointed our egos  
have deteriorated due to vasanas and also   
the desire causing objects spreading all over the world.   
Arunachala Sivas.

Dear Sreeswaroop,   
I agree with your views. Proper selection, scrutinizing the applicant's  
qualifications, his knowledge in temple rituals are all   
necessary. We follow this rule in IIT and IIM selection but not in the case  
of priests!   
Narayana Guru was an exceptional case. He met Sri Bhagavan only once in  
Skandasramam. Narayana Guru was well versed   
in Sanskrit and Vedanta. He was never against brahmins but only again  
brahmins' oligarchy to control others. He had seen   
Sri Bhagavan and was immediately attracted by His state of supreme Brahman.  
Sri Bhagavan never asked him: Wherefrom   
are you coming? Where are you going from here? What is your name? What is your  
caste? What work do you do? etc.,   
Because Sri Bhagavan never considered any body / anything other than Brahman.   
Narayana Guru wrote Nirvritti Panchakam in Skandasramam itself and also wrote  
Municharya Panchakam after   
returning to Varkala.   
He is a great saint. His 155th anniversary was recently celebrated.   
Arunachala Siva.
