## Mankuthimmana Kagga (Song of Mankuthimma)  
Author: Nagaraj             Date: March 01, 2009, 04:12:33 PM

Mankuthimmana Kagga is one of the most famous and popular major literary works  
in Kannada, composed by Dr. D. V. Gundappa (known by the name D V G), and  
published in 1943. It is widely regarded as a masterpiece among the Kannada  
speaking population of southern India. It is in fact called the Bhagavad Gita  
in Kannada. The title of this work can be translated as "Song of Mankutimma".  
Kagga is a beautiful and profound collection of 945 poems. Each poem is of  
four lines.   
Kagga explores deeper questions of life, contemplates on the meaning of  
ultimate truth (reality) and advises us to lead a balanced life in this  
complex ever changing world. Thus Kagga advises us to follow the middle path  
extending one hand towards the ultimate truth and the other hand to the  
phenomenal world. The message of many of the songs from Kagga is samatwa.   
He begins with all the questions in his mind   
I like to dedicate this thread to Mankuthimmana Kagga. I would say its the  
Kural of Kannada   
1 Sri Vishnu, Origin or universe, illusionary   
 God, God of Gods, the ultimate(supreme)   
 Which is unseen, but people believe in   
 Bow to that marvel - Mankuthimma   
2 Life, still life, universe, something   
 Dwelling in and out unknown   
 Unconfined to soul immeasurable   
 Bow to that distinction \- Mankuthimma   
3 Is it there or not there, the unknown truth,   
 Becoming great universe, disguised as life,   
 Amusing itself, if found to be good,   
 Bow to that profound unknown truth - Mankuthimma   
 **What is the meaning of Life?**   
What is the meaning of life? What is world's meaning?   
What relationship between life and world?   
Anything unseen there? What is it?   
Is it beyond our knowledge? - Mankuthimma   
Is God a dark cave?   
Is it a name given to that unknown?   
When there is a Saviour, why's this the world's story?   
What is birth and death? - Mankuthimma   
Is creation a riddle? What is the meaning of life?   
Who will analyse and untangle this surprise?   
If a hand created this unoiverse   
Why is life so diversified? - Mankuthimma   
Who is the lord of life? One or several?   
Fate, valor, virtue or blind force?   
How to improve this chaos?   
Is perplexity the end point? - Mankuthimma   
Is there any order or aim in creation?   
Does the creator's mind wonder now and then?   
If at all He is kind and affectionate   
Why do lives struggle so? - Mankuthimma   
Nagaraj

**IS GOD LIFE?**   
This illusion, appears dance-like   
Where is the fear for one who has seen the origin?   
Unattached at depth, bound by rules for outward   
Looks, Brahma loves to play - Mankuthimma   
Dark and lovely Krishna - is also Narasimha   
Moon - wearing Shiva is also roaring Rudra   
Mountain - born Parvathi like ferocious Kali   
Virtue and violence are together - Mankuthimma   
What is truth in the cosmic dance?   
Dancing is the truth for ocean waves   
Myth is myth, life - drama is true   
This is Brahma's doing - Mankuthimma   
What is Dharma? What is Karma?   
What is the story of the vast universe? What is life?   
Brahma is the nucleus of all, illusion is his trap   
Brahma is Life - Mankuthimma   
Exploring the crooked and straight world is duty   
Crude voice is just sound and cultured voice melody   
Awakening you from the unknown to the known   
Makes mind righteous - Mankuthimma

Mankuthimma's Song, is a great work, explaining the unreality of   
world and the reality of the godhead, through simple peasant's   
words. DVG is known for his deep insights, into Reality. I have   
read these poems in English and have given some verses in the   
Forum, sometime back.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramanian,   
I am glad to hear that someone from this forum already knows and has read the  
Mankuthimmana Kagga. Even if one glances these, will surely go happier   
**HUMANLY LOVE**   
What is the use of hundreds of stars in dark sky   
Traveler's eye needs a house-light   
Forget the distant God   
Poor soul requests human friend - Mankuthimma   
You submit all your love to God Hari   
Will He talk back to you or show Himself?   
Life anguishes for delectable company   
Delicate secret of human virtue - Mankuthimma   
Heart not getting love in human form   
Pours love to cat, dog or parrot   
And listens to the answering sound -   
Cools down with life's sound - Mankuthimma   
Yearning to give away all of one's self   
Love's crazy addiction   
Parts towards mother, father   
Husband, wife, brother, son or friend - Mankuthimma   
Love frustrated turns into demon, satisfied turns Lakshmi   
Gets perplexed begging for return love   
Thinking this is one's own, sacrifices one's self   
Gets soothed - Mankuthimma   
Nagaraj

**WORSHIP OF LIFE**   
Touch gently, you look at it kindly   
Appreciate it with fear, you worship that.   
Universe's essence is self originated   
Life is very dear in the universe - Mankuthimma   
Everybody is saint, everybody is a preacher   
Till life's test comes and stands in front   
Inner secrets of nature then rise from the bottom   
God is the only refuge then - Mankuthimma   
Everyone has conquered mind   
Till God, fate, illusion and beauty dazzle the eyes   
Arjuna was a sage till beautiful Subhadra   
Came dazzling in front of him - Mankuthimma   
Who has a firm determined mind like Seetha?   
But what happened when the deer came by?   
Desire is the sleeping fire hidden in an ocean   
Who would enrage it? - Mankuthimma   
Who feeds the elephant, ant, crow or frog?   
Hunger is their teacher   
Man is student of the stomach   
Has tongue in all his organs - Mankuthimma

**INTROSPECTION**   
Mind's experience, thoughts and feelings,   
When this paddy is pounded by reasoning   
We get the rice of philosophical knowledge -   
Our daily food - Mankuthimma   
Book Knowledge is like a jewel on the head   
Knowledge from mind is like flower on plant   
Perception of things comes from looking within   
Not from being scholarly - Mankuthimma   
"Isn't the major portion of creation a waste? Any meaning   
In Creating millions of worms and insects?   
Without thinking the creator is being extravagant" \- is the   
Explanation given by people with half insight - Mankuthimma   
Creator's design and notes not in front of us   
We see just a line of that   
From that can we sat lost or saved?   
This is difficult predicament - Mankuthimma   
Everything is half-light, half insight, half knowledge   
Till we know it in complete   
Who will tell us Creator's hidden secret?   
Entire life is mystery - Mankuthimma   
Nagaraj

**FAMILY HAPPINESS**   
Your grandfather, great grandfather, great great   
Grandfather incarnated in you and live in the   
Future births of your son, grandson, great grandson   
Dynasty is eternal - Mankuthimma   
There may be secrets written on your forehead   
It shows in the nature and form you see   
Touches your soul and makes you   
Feel heaven and hell are one - Mankuthimma   
Human strength from milk and rice; milk from cows   
Fed with grass; grass grows from soil's essence   
Like this when one is feeding the other   
What is milk? What is feces? - Mankuthimma   
During the first hour radiant fragrance of garlands   
Next, when stale, smells like filth   
Third hour, fades and withers and becomes a thorn   
This is the story of family - Mankuthimma   
Joy of world's connection seems enough and enough   
Just like a plant, when you touch starts itching   
Cannot scratch the itch; if scratched, wounds burn   
This is like fun of a mute person - Mankuthimma

**RELATIVE TRUTH**   
If you say, body is clay-pot, meatball, and repulsive,   
What happens to the soul?   
What will the soul do if the armor is gone?   
Don't do injustice to the body - Mankuthimma   
The sweet dreams of the beggar are not untrue   
Didn't flour in the pot spill when he kicked it?   
Hollow might be happiness and sorrow   
But the thorn is sharp for life - Mankuthimma   
It is true, though not snake, when a rope rolls down   
In the duck, appears slithering, looker sweats with fear   
World is also true like that   
Don't jeer appearances - Mankuthimma   
Can you say beauty and relationships are empty   
Won't they increase or reduce life   
When men are drowning in a sea   
Won't they just hug each other - Mankuthimma   
Very many hideous effects are caused to our mind   
By world's charm and power   
As many truths are there for them in life   
Experience is the measure of truth - Mankuthimma   
Nagaraj

**DEVOTION IS NATURAL**   
Dog seeing something in the dark and being afraid   
Believes there is a friend somewhere   
Lifts its neck moaning and barking, jumps.   
Our devotion is like that - Mankuthimma   
Father did not believe, Prahlada believed   
You are an uncertain believer and a nonbeliever   
Whether a pillar or reflection, they got salvation   
You are a fly in phlegm - Mankuthimma   
Behind the experience bigger than me and universe   
Behind the shadow of the creation   
In man's doubtful search for the greatness of truth   
Lies the greatness of humans - Mankuthimma   
Just like humans, Gods are roaming and hiding   
In Bharath country and in the migrant's faith   
God's names and forms are unnumerable   
One ocean, millions of waves   
If Man doesn't beseech, who sill care for God   
If God doesn't keep a secret will humans search for it?   
Mutual searching of God and man   
Is the grace in creation - Mankuthimma   
Nagaraj

Dear Nagaraj,   
God is the ultimate secret of life. But at the same time, He is in the   
Heart. It is hidden, by the dirt of ego. Once the dirt is removed,   
Chitta Suddhi, as Sankara calls it, reveals God. God is not somewhere, He is  
very much within us. The secrecy is due to our own hiding, the screen of ego  
that is veiling it.   
Arunachala Siva.

**HUMAN IMMORTALITY**   
Making the fallen stand up is the potency of humans   
Won't the sky clean the earth again and again by rain   
Won't the fields give away crops when it is ripe   
Build the fallen house - Mankuthimma   
Respect life, respect energy   
Don't discriminate thinking it is somebody else's world   
Fighting for abundance in life is for yourself   
This is the way to flourish soul - Mankuthimma   
Think of life's work as work in the garden   
If laughter shines in every face in the world   
Because of fruits of labor of intelligence and emotions   
This itself is serving God - Mankuthimma   
What emotions spring in mind seeing a rose blossom   
Hurt? Happiness? Look, that thorn in life is the crown   
For the flower, this is the handiwork of time   
This is the core of life - Mankuthimma   
Gardener digs, puts manure and waters   
And tolerates the stinging of thorns. Rose smiles   
For half a minute; the life is over after the smile.   
Smile is the satisfaction for toil - Mankuthimma

**TRUTH PERCEPTION**   
The imperfect beauty perceived by us   
Are the ocean waves of happiness and essence   
Sun is far away, his rays are reachable   
Are waves sign of maturity? - Mankuthimma   
If beauty and relationship are not true   
Where in the world is the perfect truth?   
The fragrant breeze comes from the flower   
Oh philosophy, no doubt about it - Mankuthimma   
Won't half a moment's experience melt the mind?   
Won't it ripen the life's essence?   
Can you say this essence affecting our   
Heat and coolness is false - Mankuthimma   
Something is good, something is beautiful   
Seeking something in different directions   
Life experiences in the inner soul   
Call of sentiment's origin - Mankuthimma   
Like a dog seeking and sniffing   
The foot-smell of his missing owner   
God's coquetry is making us look here and there   
To find good in this poor world - Mankuthimma   
Nagaraj

Mankuthimmana Kagga. Even if one glances these, will surely go happier   
**HUMANLY LOVE**   
What is the use of hundreds of stars in dark sky   
Traveler's eye needs a house-light   
Forget the distant God   
Poor soul requests human friend - Mankuthimma   
You submit all your love to God Hari   
Will He talk back to you or show Himself?   
Life anguishes for delectable company   
Delicate secret of human virtue - Mankuthimma   
Heart not getting love in human form   
Pours love to cat, dog or parrot   
And listens to the answering sound -   
Cools down with life's sound - Mankuthimma   
Yearning to give away all of one's self   
Love's crazy addiction   
Parts towards mother, father   
Husband, wife, brother, son or friend - Mankuthimma   
Love frustrated turns into demon, satisfied turns Lakshmi   
Gets perplexed begging for return love   
Thinking this is one's own, sacrifices one's self   
Gets soothed - Mankuthimma   
Nagaraj

**WORSHIP OF LIFE**   
Touch gently, you look at it kindly   
Appreciate it with fear, you worship that.   
Universe's essence is self originated   
Life is very dear in the universe - Mankuthimma   
Everybody is saint, everybody is a preacher   
Till life's test comes and stands in front   
Inner secrets of nature then rise from the bottom   
God is the only refuge then - Mankuthimma   
Everyone has conquered mind   
Till God, fate, illusion and beauty dazzle the eyes   
Arjuna was a sage till beautiful Subhadra   
Came dazzling in front of him - Mankuthimma   
Who has a firm determined mind like Seetha?   
But what happened when the deer came by?   
Desire is the sleeping fire hidden in an ocean   
Who would enrage it? - Mankuthimma   
Who feeds the elephant, ant, crow or frog?   
Hunger is their teacher   
Man is student of the stomach   
Has tongue in all his organs - Mankuthimma

**INTROSPECTION**   
Mind's experience, thoughts and feelings,   
When this paddy is pounded by reasoning   
We get the rice of philosophical knowledge -   
Our daily food - Mankuthimma   
Book Knowledge is like a jewel on the head   
Knowledge from mind is like flower on plant   
Perception of things comes from looking within   
Not from being scholarly - Mankuthimma   
"Isn't the major portion of creation a waste? Any meaning   
In Creating millions of worms and insects?   
Without thinking the creator is being extravagant" \- is the   
Explanation given by people with half insight - Mankuthimma   
Creator's design and notes not in front of us   
We see just a line of that   
From that can we sat lost or saved?   
This is difficult predicament - Mankuthimma   
Everything is half-light, half insight, half knowledge   
Till we know it in complete   
Who will tell us Creator's hidden secret?   
Entire life is mystery - Mankuthimma   
Nagaraj

**FAMILY HAPPINESS**   
Your grandfather, great grandfather, great great   
Grandfather incarnated in you and live in the   
Future births of your son, grandson, great grandson   
Dynasty is eternal - Mankuthimma   
There may be secrets written on your forehead   
It shows in the nature and form you see   
Touches your soul and makes you   
Feel heaven and hell are one - Mankuthimma   
Human strength from milk and rice; milk from cows   
Fed with grass; grass grows from soil's essence   
Like this when one is feeding the other   
What is milk? What is feces? - Mankuthimma   
During the first hour radiant fragrance of garlands   
Next, when stale, smells like filth   
Third hour, fades and withers and becomes a thorn   
This is the story of family - Mankuthimma   
Joy of world's connection seems enough and enough   
Just like a plant, when you touch starts itching   
Cannot scratch the itch; if scratched, wounds burn   
This is like fun of a mute person - Mankuthimma

**RELATIVE TRUTH**   
If you say, body is clay-pot, meatball, and repulsive,   
What happens to the soul?   
What will the soul do if the armor is gone?   
Don't do injustice to the body - Mankuthimma   
The sweet dreams of the beggar are not untrue   
Didn't flour in the pot spill when he kicked it?   
Hollow might be happiness and sorrow   
But the thorn is sharp for life - Mankuthimma   
It is true, though not snake, when a rope rolls down   
In the duck, appears slithering, looker sweats with fear   
World is also true like that   
Don't jeer appearances - Mankuthimma   
Can you say beauty and relationships are empty   
Won't they increase or reduce life   
When men are drowning in a sea   
Won't they just hug each other - Mankuthimma   
Very many hideous effects are caused to our mind   
By world's charm and power   
As many truths are there for them in life   
Experience is the measure of truth - Mankuthimma

**DEVOTION IS NATURAL**   
Dog seeing something in the dark and being afraid   
Believes there is a friend somewhere   
Lifts its neck moaning and barking, jumps.   
Our devotion is like that - Mankuthimma   
Father did not believe, Prahlada believed   
You are an uncertain believer and a nonbeliever   
Whether a pillar or reflection, they got salvation   
You are a fly in phlegm - Mankuthimma   
Behind the experience bigger than me and universe   
Behind the shadow of the creation   
In man's doubtful search for the greatness of truth   
Lies the greatness of humans - Mankuthimma   
Just like humans, Gods are roaming and hiding   
In Bharath country and in the migrant's faith   
God's names and forms are unnumerable   
One ocean, millions of waves   
If Man doesn't beseech, who sill care for God   
If God doesn't keep a secret will humans search for it?   
Mutual searching of God and man   
Is the grace in creation - Mankuthimma

Dear Nagaraj,   
God is the ultimate secret of life. But at the same time, He is in the   
Heart. It is hidden, by the dirt of ego. Once the dirt is removed,   
Chitta Suddhi, as Sankara calls it, reveals God. God is not somewhere, He is  
very much within us. The secrecy is due to our own hiding, the screen of ego  
that is veiling it.   
Arunachala Siva.

**HUMAN IMMORTALITY**   
Making the fallen stand up is the potency of humans   
Won't the sky clean the earth again and again by rain   
Won't the fields give away crops when it is ripe   
Build the fallen house - Mankuthimma   
Respect life, respect energy   
Don't discriminate thinking it is somebody else's world   
Fighting for abundance in life is for yourself   
This is the way to flourish soul - Mankuthimma   
Think of life's work as work in the garden   
If laughter shines in every face in the world   
Because of fruits of labor of intelligence and emotions   
This itself is serving God - Mankuthimma   
What emotions spring in mind seeing a rose blossom   
Hurt? Happiness? Look, that thorn in life is the crown   
For the flower, this is the handiwork of time   
This is the core of life - Mankuthimma   
Gardener digs, puts manure and waters   
And tolerates the stinging of thorns. Rose smiles   
For half a minute; the life is over after the smile.   
Smile is the satisfaction for toil - Mankuthimma   
Nagaraj

**TRUTH PERCEPTION**   
The imperfect beauty perceived by us   
Are the ocean waves of happiness and essence   
Sun is far away, his rays are reachable   
Are waves sign of maturity? - Mankuthimma   
If beauty and relationship are not true   
Where in the world is the perfect truth?   
The fragrant breeze comes from the flower   
Oh philosophy, no doubt about it - Mankuthimma   
Won't half a moment's experience melt the mind?   
Won't it ripen the life's essence?   
Can you say this essence affecting our   
Heat and coolness is false - Mankuthimma   
Something is good, something is beautiful   
Seeking something in different directions   
Life experiences in the inner soul   
Call of sentiment's origin - Mankuthimma   
Like a dog seeking and sniffing   
The foot-smell of his missing owner   
God's coquetry is making us look here and there   
To find good in this poor world - Mankuthimma   
Nagaraj
