## Veera Subbaiha Swami  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 30, 2009, 08:44:50 AM

Veera Subbaiah Swami was Head of Kovilur Math. He was endowed with strong  
faith and will, nad had the requisite influence and force   
of character to found numerous Vedapata Salas and choultries and   
renovate numerous temples in South India. Swami first came to see   
Bhagavan Ramana, with a number of Math Heads, when Bhagavan   
Ramana was still staying in Virupaksha Cave. He has also written   
a commentary on Jnana Vasishatam. He first saw Bhagavan Ramana's Ulladu  
Narpadu, (Sad Darsanam) and was thrilled at the profound meaning and rich  
experience embedded in His writings. Kunju Swami used to visit Kovilur Math,  
in Tiruvannamalai, at Bhagavan's instance, whenever there was a function  
there.   
Veera Subbaiah Swami renovated the Tiruturaipundi temple. This place is near  
Nagapattinam, in east coast. On the car festival day of the renovated temple,  
the car did not move, after some distance.   
The people told Swami to give an offering of goat or a cock, so that   
the car would move. Swami did not agree and went to the extent of saying: If  
you are so interested, you can give me as bali, offering.   
I am prepared to die for the sake of movement of the car! He went to the  
sanctum sanctorum of the Temple and prayed intently to Siva for hours and then  
came back. The car then was pulled and it started moving. When the car came  
to the North Street, where Veera Subbaiah Swami was staying in a hut, they  
showed arti to Siva and Uma and people shouted Hara Hara, in ecstasy. Veera  
Subbaiah Swami, who was very old and sick then, came out to see the arti,  
braced in the arms of his friend Subbarya Iyer. As he was watching the arti,  
tears flowed from his eyes, and in front of the car, he departed from the  
world, in the arms of Subbraya Iyer!   
Sri Kanchi Chandrasekara Saraswati Swami, who was witnessing the episode later  
said: He was such a great soul that he merged with Siva at the appropriate  
moment! The bali was also given by his own nirvana on that evening!

## Sri Dakshinamurti Swami  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 30, 2009, 09:31:15 AM  
---  
Sri Dakshinamurti Swami, Arunachalam, in his poorvasrama, was   
born in a village called Kilalathur, near Tiruchirapalli. His parents   
not with out an issue, went to Arunachala and did giri pradakshina.   
While doing, they heard a voice: "Do not worry. I shall be born as your  
son!". Soon Arunachalam was born.   
The child was dumb in his early years. His father, Sivachidambaram Pillai,  
brought a monk to see his son. The monk came and saw the child and told his  
parents, 'The child is not dumb at all. You can speak to him now." The  
parents then asked the child: "O dear child,   
why are you remaining with eyes closed?" The child replied: " I am remaining  
still, Summa Irukkiren!" The monk then continued: "O child, who are you that  
is remaining still? The child replied: "You   
yourself are I. And I am myself you!" The monk then exclaimed: "Satyam, Satyam!" and then the monk vanished from the spot. The   
parents immediately realized that their child and the monk were both   
Lord Arunachaleswara. The parents died on the same day, after a   
few years and Arunachalam left his village and came to Tiruvottiyur,   
(remember Kavykanta Ganapati Sastri's penance here.).   
The child then came to be called Sri Dakshinamurti Swami. He did many  
miracles, like curing a brahmin's daughter who was abnormal and cranky. He  
then came to Tiruvarur and he stopped further wandering.   
There was one Somanatha Mudaliar in Chidambram. He was suffering from  
incurable colic pain and was about to end his life. Nataraja appeared before  
him and said: Go to Dakshinamurti in Tiruvarur.   
Mudaliar came to Tiruvarur and was praying to Sri Dakshinamoorthy in Siva  
temple. The cure was not happening. He again cried and asked Siva. Siva  
said: This is not the Dakshinamoorthy, I said. There is one Sri  
Dakshinamurti, wandering naked in this place. Go to him."   
Mudaliar then met Sri Dakshinamurti, eating left overs from leaf plates that  
were thrown in front of his own house! He went to him and prostrated. Sri  
Dakshinamurti Swamigal then placed the leftover food which he had on his hand  
into the mouth of Mudaliar and then asked: Did Natesan send you here?,  
meaning Nataraja of Chidambaram! It was only after this, the Swami came to be  
called as   
Sri Dakshinamurti Swami.   
A few days before his Maha Samadhi, Sri Dakshinamurti exclaimed: "Finished! Finished! Completely Finished!" and withdrew into a state of  
permanent Nishta, Absorption in the Self. He is said to have attained Maha  
Nirvana, around end of August 1835. His Samadhi shrine is located at  
Madappauram in Tiruvarur.

## Tiru ViLaiyadal Puranam  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: March 31, 2009, 07:31:29 AM  
---  
Once when Siva and Uma were sitting relaxedly in Kailas, the six   
Krittika Girls, who were mothers to Skanda and gave him milk in   
the Saravana Pond, came to the Divine Mother and Father and   
asked them to teach Ashtama Siddhis, the 8 great Siddhic powers.   
Siva told them: "Uma is the presiding deity for 8 great siddhis. So   
you contemplate her in the mind and then listen to my teaching.   
After learning, you should contemplate on Uma everyday, to retain   
those powers." They all agreed. The six mothers of Skanda, were   
taught the Ashtama Siddhis. But due to forgetting daily contemplation on Uma,  
they forgot those Siddhis in due course.   
Siva cursed them to be born as six rocks in a place called Patta Mangai, near  
Madurai. They took the form of six rocks and remained   
near Madurai for long, long time. Siva came after many years as a   
Siddha and stood before these rocks. The rocks became alive as   
six Karttikai Mothers and then Siva taught them the Siddhis once again. They  
thanked him and remained as the friends in the inner courtyard of Princess  
Meenakshi and served her till Meenakshi was   
married to Somasundara and the divine couple returned to Kailas.

I was reading one of the lectures of Satya Sai Baba during some Christmas. He  
said the real meaning or essence of the Cross is cutting the I   
The I is to be cut. Thats what the horizontal line signifies, This the the  
Cross of Jesus!   
It was a beautiful explanation!!

Bhagavan Ramana has said to Major Chadwick: Cross is the Ego,   
carried by the individual. When the individual soul is crucified, when the he  
with his ego is killed, he resurrects as the Self. Jesus's resurrection is  
the emancipation of the individual from the burden of the ego. Then he  
becomes god or Son of God.
