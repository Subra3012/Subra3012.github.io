I was reading one of the lectures of Satya Sai Baba during some Christmas. He  
said the real meaning or essence of the Cross is cutting the I   
The I is to be cut. Thats what the horizontal line signifies, This the the  
Cross of Jesus!   
It was a beautiful explanation!!

Bhagavan Ramana has said to Major Chadwick: Cross is the Ego,   
carried by the individual. When the individual soul is crucified, when the he  
with his ego is killed, he resurrects as the Self. Jesus's resurrection is  
the emancipation of the individual from the burden of the ego. Then he  
becomes god or Son of God.   
Arunachala Siva.
