Per Italiani.   
verso la fine di novembre/2007 sarei intenzionato a visitare l'asram. Gradirei  
molto parlare con qualcuno che ci Ã¨ giÃ stato per qualche consiglio. Vivo a  
Roma.   
Ringrazio anticipatamente

in our hearth there is our asram. Rome is very far from Arunachala, but Ramana  
is really present, time and space indipendent

Per Italiani.   
verso la fine di novembre/2007 sarei intenzionato a visitare l'asram. Gradirei  
molto parlare con qualcuno che ci è già stato per qualche consiglio. Vivo a  
Roma.

## staying at Arunachala Asramam  
Author: jozia               Date: January 05, 2007, 03:41:03 PM

I have checked out both of these new web-sites and note that no-where does it  
mention whether it is still possible to stay at Arunachala Ashramam as in the  
past.   
Can one still do this ? (I haven't been there yet). And will the ashram still  
send-out taxis to the airport as in the past ?   
Thank you,   
Jozia

I think, you better contact Shri Ramanashramam authority. Here is the link to  
"Contact Us" page from the new site: http://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/contactus.html   
That's what I did when I last visited the Ashramam.
