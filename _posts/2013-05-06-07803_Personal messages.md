**Writer Proves You Can Survive Without the Internet for a Year**   
http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/tech-writer-proves-survive-internet-  
year/story?id=19088407#.UYUzhko7GZY   
 Even if some of us can remember a time before it, living without the Internet  
seems impossible.   
But Paul Miller, a 26-year-old writer at The Verge, a technology site, just  
did the seemingly impossible: He survived a year without the Internet.   
He didn't read e-mail, type a word into Google, or download apps. He never saw  
Obama tweet his reelection victory, watched a "Harlem Shake" video or had even  
seen a Vine. He lived his entire year -- a full 365 days -- offline in hopes  
of finding out more about himself and focusing on some other activities.   
But Wednesday, Miller rejoined the rest of us digital nomads and reconnected  
the WiFi on his laptop and iPad.   
ABC News spoke to Paul when he was just starting his journey last year and  
decided to catch up with him again to find out what he learned, how it went,  
and what he is looking forward to the most on the Internet again.   
 **Did you really do it? Did you really avoid all parts of the Internet for a  
year?**   
Yes, with one exception. I was at the library trying to look for a book and I  
pulled up the card catalog and it turned out to be a website. I did  
inadvertently click a link, but as soon as I realized my mistake, I fled.   
But yes, I avoided looking at people's screens all the time. Even when people  
tried to show me Instagrams on their phones I always looked away. I didn't use  
the Internet for a year.   
 **What was the hardest part about it?**   
It was really easy to not load a browser or use apps and keep WiFi off, but  
when people tried to show me things -- funny YouTube videos or Instagrams --  
it just felt really selfish of me. They wanted to show me something -- they  
weren't doing the experiment -- and it felt rude of me. They just wanted to  
share something with me, and I felt rude. That was hard.   
When we talked earlier, you were finding out about other ways to communicate: the phone, telephone books, snail mail, etc. How did you get around not using  
the Internet?   
A lot of those practical things never really became an issue. I went to the  
library a lot, but they don't really have books at the library anymore; they  
just have computers mostly now. I got a lot of letters but I never really got  
into the groove of sending letters. And then I used 411 a lot instead of the  
phonebook. I mostly just asked people questions. I really did learn you can  
get lots of great information from asking real people.   
 **What did you want to accomplish in this year? Did you feel like it was a  
success?**   
I wanted to read a lot and educate myself. But then it evolved into an  
experiment where I could learn something about the Internet. I didn't really  
succeed, but I learned a lot. I got some reading done and some writing done,  
but I am not a transformed person.   
 **What are you looking forward to seeing the most once you connect?**   
I want to see the big things I missed this year, the Internet culture that I  
missed. I also missed the people and connecting with them online.   
 **What did you learn? Do you come back to the Internet feeling more  
 balanced?**   
The big thing I learned is I can't blame the Internet for my problems. I  
thought leaving the Internet would fix some of my issues, but they are more  
innate. The experiment was a failure because I didn't fix myself; I just  
stayed away from that part of myself. I did learn what priorities are  
important to me. Family is really important. I actually wasn't able to connect  
with my family as well since I couldn't Skype with my niece and nephew.   
What is your advice to people that feel overwhelmed by the Internet, to those  
that wish they could disconnect more? I think we have an uphill climb. As a  
society, we are learning how to not bombard each other, and I think that's  
what becomes overwhelming. It's not that the Internet is crazy; it is the  
people on the Internet that want your attention. That's not wrong. We just  
need to figure out how to balance that.   
 _ **Note: Paul was able to quit the Internet as part of his job at The Verge.  
He said he was really lucky he was able to do it.**_

Dear Hari,   
I dont think there is limitation like this. I never saw this option. Maybe is  
something wrong with your settings.

I haven't touched my settings. When I try to post another message, this error  
appears "You have exceeded the limit of 2 personal messages per hour."
