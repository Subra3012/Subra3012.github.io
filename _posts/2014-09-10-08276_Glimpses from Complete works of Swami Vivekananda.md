**Note : Avudyar Koil is a very ancient Temple associated with Saint  
Manickavachagar and being in Tamil Nadu I have never visited it and I intend  
to visit it in due course. Unlike the other popular Shiva temples in Tamil  
Nadu this is not so much popular as this is not a Parihara Sthalam ( i.e place  
for doing pujas and rituals for our own benefit ). This temple is very unique  
and is different from the Other Shiva Temples and So I am using this thread to  
first educate myself as well as others about this temple. Those who have  
visited this temple and have any specific info about this temple can also  
share the same here. **   
 **This God doesn 't have shape - Avudayar Koil Temple, Aranthangi, India**   
http://indiancolumbus.blogspot.com/2010/04/god-doesnt-have-shape-avudayar-  
koil.html   
 Avudayar Koil temple is one of the oldest temples in Tamil Nadu state, South  
India. Avudayar Koil temple is located in the small town named Audayaurkoil,  
which is around 14 kms from Aranthangi city of Pudhukkottai district in Tamil  
Nadu state, India. The town was called as Thiruperunthurai in ancient times.  
The temple is the only attraction of the town, and it attracts hundreds of  
devotees and tourists daily. Avudayar Koil temple (the word "Koil" means  
"temple" in Tamil language) is attractive not only due to spiritual reasons,  
but also due to its architecture and sculpture. It is because of this temple,  
the entire Avudayarkoil town has been declared as 'heritage town' by the  
government.   
Even thought the temple is famously referred as Avudayar Koil, the name of the  
temple is Athmanatha Swamy Temple. The original temple is believed to be built  
by Manikavasagar in the 8th century AD. It is evident that the temple has been  
extended in the later years. Manikavasagar was one of the four important Tamil  
saints of Saivism (Lord Shiva worship) out of 63 Nayanmars (63 important  
saints of Shiva). You can find the idols of all 63 saints in most of the Shiva  
temples in South India. You can find four saints among 63 saints in separate  
shrines or in a higher platform in some temples. Manikavasagar is one of those  
four important Nayanmars. Avudayar Koil temple story is connected to the  
history of saint Manikavasagar.   
The King Arimardhana Pandian asked his minister Thiruvadhavoorar to buy horses  
and gave him money. The minister came to a place named Perunthurai to buy  
horses. However, he was impressed by a Ved "paatsaala". Ultimately, he  
attained "Gnana" (the ultimate knowledge) here, and he used the money to buy  
horses to build this temple. Initially, only a platform like thing was built  
and offering of rice was kept on the platform. The steam was considered as God  
(Shiva) for him. It is the same platform which still present inside the shrine  
and the same rituals are still followed. In the later years, Pandia kings  
extended the temple with beautiful sculptures and pillars. The minister  
Thiruvadhavoorar thus became a great devoteed of Lord Shiva, and got the name  
Manikavasagar. He wrote the famous "Thiruvasagam" in Avudayaur Koil temple.   
The main deity of the temple Athmanatha Swamy (a name of Lord Shiva) doesn't  
have any image or figure. There is just a platform in the main shrine. This is  
a unique feature of this temple. Another unique feature of this temple is that  
you cannot find Nandi, Dwajasthamba, and Chandikeswarar, which are commonly  
found in all South Indian ancient Shiva temples. The main goddess of the  
temple, Yogambal, has a separate shrine. Again, there is no idol for the  
goddess. You can only find Paadam (foot print) in the shrine. There is a small  
idol of goddess located outside the main shrine.   
As you enter the main temple, you can find small Pillayar (Ganesha) idol to  
your left. Next to that, there is a big shrines for the saint Manikavasagar.  
There are ancient paintings found surrounding this shrine. Also, there are  
very beautiful sculptures of Narasimha, Kaali, Ganesha, Subramanya, and  
others. There are also big life size scultpures such as Veerabhadra, Yatcha,  
Daksha, and others. All these sculptures are very beautiful and have  
uniqueness. Once you enter into the temple, there is a small mandapa full of  
scultpures. There are sculptures that are associated with the temple such as  
God making foxes as horses when the King was asking the minister for horses,  
and making the horses back to foxes. You can also find the idols of  
Arimardhana Pandian, Manikavasagar, and others.   
If you enter further into the temple, there is another Manikavasagar shrine  
surrouded by ancient paintings. There are many pillars with beautiful  
sculptures. On the ceiling, you can find Pancha Bhoothas. The main shrine of  
Athmanatha Swamy doesn't have an idol, as described earlier. The corridor  
(prakara) surrounding the Athmanatha Swamy shrine has the idols of Chokka  
Vinayaka, Manikavasagar, Nataraj, Bikshandar, Kali, Veerabhadra, etc. I have  
already mentioned about the shrine of goddess Yogambal. There is a tree  
(Kurutha tree - Sthala vruksham) where the idols of Shiva teaching  
Manikavasagar is found. There is a small shrine for Nataraj with Sivakami, and  
another shrine for Lord Muruga. The outer prakara has idols of Lord Ganesha in  
all the corners. You can also find the temple tank in the outer corridor. The  
idols of Muthu Vinayaka and Muneeswaran are also found there.   
All over the temple, you can find a lot of meaningful sculptures. There is no  
separate shrine or idols for Navagrahas (nine planets) similar to other  
temples. They are found only in the pillars. The 27 stars have figures in this  
temple. There is a saptha swara pillar (musical pillar). The stone chain is a  
famous sculpture in this temple. There are a lot to explore in this temple,  
which cannot be explained in detail in this post. Visit the temple to get your  
own experience.

Avudayar Koil ? The formless ultimate god   
http://chennaitian.blogspot.in/2011/08/avudayar-koil-formless-ultimate-  
god.html   
Significances:  The original shrine was established by Saint Manickavasagar.   
 More than 1200 years old based on the predictions of Manickavasagar?s period and south facing temple which is a rare kind in Siva temples.

Athmananda Swamy Temple   
Also known as:Thiruperunthurai Temple, Avudaiyar koil, Audayar Kovil   
http://www.hikeezee.com/explore/destinations/athmananda-swamy-temple-3133   
introduction   
Avudaiyar Koil (temple) also known as Athmananda Swamy Temple and  
Thiruperunthurai temple, is 50 kms from the town of Pudukkottai, a place that  
resounds with kings and traitors, history and bravery and art, music, culture  
and spirituality.. The reigning deity of the temple is Athmananda Swamy, but  
the temple is Avudaiyar Koil. Avudaiyar Koil is one among the 275 ?Paadal  
Petra Sthalams? or shrines that feature in songs sung by great saints and  
musicians.   
Unusually in this Shiva temple, there is no lingam in the sanctum sanctorum.  
Avudaiyar Koil has been embellished with beautiful sculpture and art work as a  
result of which the town of Avudayarkoil has been declared as a ?heritage  
town? by the government.   
Avudaiyar Koil is the temple of Athmanandaswamy. This holy place has an  
honoured place in the history of Shaivism. In inscriptions, this temple is  
known famously as Thiruperundurai (the biggest harbor) and is intimately  
associated with the Saint Manikavachagar, the great poet whose work  
?Thiruvasagam? or sayings is an important religious, spiritual and social  
commentary in Tamizh language..   
Inscriptions found in this temple describe it as a chaturvedi mangalam  
denoting the fact that it was the home of great scholars, who were masters of  
all the four Vedas, the holy scriptures of Hindus.   
 Attractions   
Sculptures   
Avudaiyar Koil?s mandapams (hallways) are decorated with breathtaking  
sculptures. The granite roofs are assembled and are marvelous pieces of  
construction. Avudayar Koil is famous for the art of Kodungai carving, the  
work done under the stone that forms the sun shade or overhang of the roof. It  
usually sits on top of the beam stone and is a superb example of the craft of  
the 9th century artisans. There is a popular story that states that any  
contract written for all subsequent temples specifically exclude the structure  
of Athmanandha Swamy?s Avudaiyar Koil from being replicated. Sculptors from  
these parts consider the sculptures of this temple as a benchmark in carving.   
The shrine of the dancing Lord Ganesha - Nardhana Vinayakar - is designed in  
such a way that the rays of the sun fall on the Lord throughout the year!  
Other masterpieces in carvings are the ones of Goddess Kali and the saint  
himself, Manikavachagar. The larger monolith figures of Agni, fire god and  
Agora Veerabadra (the doorkeepers) at the entrance are stunning.   
The offering of the ?naivedyam? or prasad is also unique in Avudaiyar Koil. On  
a platform in front of the Avudaiyar, the priest spreads hot boiled rice,  
greens and bitter gourd without salt. The steam that rises from these is the  
offering to the Lord.   
The striking granite sculptures in the Avudaiyar Koil temple are the many  
carvings, stone chains and the pillars of the mandapam. There are stone  
inscriptions that record one of the temple?s consecrations as 1891 CE. The  
chariot car of this temple is renowned for its wood carvings.   
Later periods of the temple?s history can be identified by the finest examples  
of the early Chola style of sculptures. An architectural description of the 27  
constellations and stories presented in a line of fresco paintings is  
beautiful.   
Avudaiyar Koil?s highlights are the Kuravan and Kurathi. The figures are  
examples of the attention to intricate details shown by the sculptors. The  
minute details from the toe nails to the hairstyles with every strand of hair  
delineated, to the veins and bones of the body lovingly recreated makes the  
visitor wonder at the dedication of the sculptors of that era.

Author: Nagaraj             Date: August 18, 2014, 12:01:45 PM

_This idea of complete self-sacrifice is illustrated in the following story: After the battle of Kurukshetra the five Pandava brothers performed a great  
sacrifice and made very large gifts to the poor. All people expressed  
amazement at the greatness and richness of the sacrifice, and said that such a  
sacrifice the world had never seen before. But, after the ceremony, there came  
a little mongoose, half of whose body was golden, and the other half brown;  
and he began to roll on the floor of the sacrificial hall. He said to those  
around, "You are all liars; this is no sacrifice." "What!" they exclaimed,  
"you say this is no sacrifice; do you not know how money and jewels were  
poured out to the poor and every one became rich and happy? This was the most  
wonderful sacrifice any man ever performed." But the mongoose said, "There was  
once a little village, and in it there dwelt a poor Brahmin with his wife, his  
son, and his son's wife. They were very poor and lived on small gifts made to  
them for preaching and teaching. There came in that land a three years'  
famine, and the poor Brahmin suffered more than ever. At last when the family  
had starved for days, the father brought home one morning a little barley  
flour, which he had been fortunate enough to obtain, and he divided it into  
four parts, one for each member of the family. **They prepared it for their  
meal, and just as they were about to eat, there was a knock at the door. The  
father opened it, and there stood a guest. Now in India a guest is a sacred  
person; he is as a god for the time being, and must be treated as such. So the  
poor Brahmin said, 'Come in, sir; you are welcome,' He set before the guest  
his own portion of the food, which the guest quickly ate and said, 'Oh, sir,  
you have killed me; I have been starving for ten days, and this little bit has  
but increased my hunger.' Then the wife said to her husband, 'Give him my  
share,' but the husband said, 'Not so.' The wife however insisted, saying,  
'Here is a poor man, and it is our duty as householders to see that he is fed,  
and it is my duty as a wife to give him my portion, seeing that you have no  
more to offer him.' Then she gave her share to the guest, which he ate, and  
said he was still burning with hunger. So the son said, 'Take my portion also;  
it is the duty of a son to help his father to fulfil his obligations.' The  
guest ate that, but remained still unsatisfied; so the son's wife gave him her  
portion also. That was sufficient, and the guest departed, blessing them. That  
night those four people died of starvation.** A few granules of that flour had  
fallen on the floor; and when I rolled my body on them, half of it became  
golden, as you see. Since then I have been travelling all over the world,  
hoping to find another sacrifice like that, but nowhere have I found one;  
nowhere else has the other half of my body been turned into gold. That is why  
I say this is no sacrifice."   
This idea of charity is going out of India; great men are becoming fewer and  
fewer. When I was first learning English, I read an English story book in  
which there was a story about a dutiful boy who had gone out to work and had  
given some of his money to his old mother, and this was praised in three or  
four pages. What was that? No Hindu boy can ever understand the moral of that  
story. Now I understand it when I hear the Western idea ? every man for  
himself. And some men take everything for themselves, and fathers and mothers  
and wives and children go to the wall. That should never and nowhere be the  
ideal of the householder.   
Now you see what Karma-Yoga means; even at the point of death to help any one,  
without asking questions. **Be cheated millions of times and never ask a  
question, and never think of what you are doing.** Never vaunt of your gifts  
to the poor or expect their gratitude, but rather be grateful to them for  
giving you the occasion of practicing charity to them. **Thus it is plain that  
to be an ideal householder is a much more difficult task than to be an ideal  
Sannyasin; the true life of work is indeed as hard as, if not harder than, the  
equally true life of renunciation.**_

_It is necessary in the study of Karma-Yoga **to know what duty is**. If I  
have to do something **I must first know that it is my duty, and then I can do  
it.**   
-   
 **Any action that makes us go Godward is a good action, and is our duty; any  
action that makes us go downward is evil, and is not our duty.** From the  
subjective standpoint we may see that certain acts have a tendency to exalt  
and ennoble us, while certain other acts have a tendency to degrade and to  
brutalise us. But it is not possible to make out with certainty which acts  
have which kind of tendency in relation to all persons, of all sorts and  
conditions. There is, however, only one idea of duty which has been  
universally accepted by all mankind, of all ages and sects and countries, and  
that has been summed up in a Sanskrit aphorism thus: **?Do not injure any  
being; not injuring any being is virtue, injuring any being is sin.?**_

_The one point we ought to remember is that **we should always try to see the  
duty of others through their own eyes, and never judge the customs of other  
peoples by our own standard.** I am not the standard of the universe. I have  
to accommodate myself to the world, and not the world to me. So we see that  
environments change the nature of our duties, and doing the duty which is ours  
at any particular time is the best thing we can do in this world. Let us do  
that duty which is ours by birth; and when we have done that, let us do the  
duty which is ours by our position in life and in society._

_One-sidedness is the bane of the world. The more sides you can develop the  
more souls you have, and you can see the universe through all souls - through  
the Bhakta (devotee) and the Jnani (philosopher). Determine your own nature  
and stick to it. Nishtha (devotion to one ideal) is the only method for the  
beginner; but with devotion and sincerity it will lead to all._

Disciple: What ideal should we follow now?   
Swamiji: You have now to make the character of Mahavira your ideal. See how at  
the command of Ramachandra he crossed the ocean. He had no care for life or  
death! He was a perfect master of his senses and wonderfully sagacious. You  
have now to build your life on this great ideal of personal service. Through  
that, all other ideals will gradually manifest in life. Obedience to the Guru  
without questioning, and strict observance of Brahmacharya--this is the secret  
of success. As on the one hand Hanuman represent the ideal of service, so on  
the other hand he represents leonine courage, striking the whole world with  
awe. He has not the least hesitation in sacrificing his life for the good of  
Rama. A supreme indifference to everything except the service of Rama, even to  
the attainment of the status of Brahma and Shiva, the great World-Gods! Only  
the carrying out of Shri Rama's behest is the one vow of this life! Such  
whole-hearted devotion is wanted. Playing on the Khol and Kartal and dancing  
in the frenzy of Kirtana has degenerated the whole people. They are, in the  
first place, a race of dyspeptics--and if in addition to this they dance and  
jump in that way, how can they bear the strain? In trying to imitate the  
highest Sadhana, the preliminary qualification for which is absolute purity,  
they have beenswallowed in dire Tamas. In every district and village you may  
visit, you will find only the sound of the Khol and Kartal! Are not drums made  
in the country? Are not trumpets and kettle-drums available in India? Make the  
boys hear the deep-toned sound of these instruments. Hearing from boyhood the  
sound of these effeminate forms of music and listening to the kirtana, the  
country is well-nigh converted into a country of women. What more degradation  
can you expect? Even the poet's imagination fails to draw this picture! The  
Damaru and horn have to be sounded, drums are to be beaten so as to raise the  
deep and martial notes, and with "Mahavira, Mahavira" on your lips and  
shouting "Hara, Hara, Vyom, Vyom", the quarters are to be reverberated. The  
music which awakens only the softer feelings of man is to be stopped now for  
some time. Stopping the light tunes such as Kheal and Tappa for some time, the  
people are to be accustomed to hear the Dhrupad music. Through the thunder-  
roll of the dignified Vedic hymns, life is to be brought back into the  
country. In everything the austere spirit of heroic manhood is to be revived.  
In following such an ideal lies the good of the people and the country. If you  
can build your character after such an ideal, then a thousand others will  
follow. But take care that you do not swerve an inch from the ideal. Never  
lose heart. In eating, dressing, or lying, in singing or playing, in enjoyment  
or disease, always manifest the highest moral courage. Then only will you  
attain the grace of Mahashakti, the Divine Mother.
