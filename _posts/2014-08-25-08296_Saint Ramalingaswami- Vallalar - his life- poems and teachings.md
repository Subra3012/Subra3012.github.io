## Muruganar Liberation Day - 25.08.2014  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: August 25, 2014, 09:35:24 AM  
---  
Today is Muruganar Liberation Day. He was thirty three years old when he met  
Sri Bhagavan for the first time in   
September 1923. One can say that ordinarily one's life before Sri Bhagavan  
enters it as a waste. For, till then one is   
caught up in illusions, in the whirl of externalized mind. However, in  
Muruganar's case, it was different. The earlier years   
were the years of preparation for the work earmarked for him in Sri Bhagavan's  
schme of things. Was he not to be the   
incomparable Tamizh bard of Sri Bhagavan? Tamizh genius flowered in the  
Sangam literature and above all in the devotional   
songs of sixty three Saivite poets. Muruganar had to be ready for the purpose  
of his life acquiring through mastery of Tamizh   
literature coming down through the ages. Tamizh became part of his very being  
by sheer dent of his hard work and his choice   
association with contemporary Tamizh literary giants like U. Ve. Swaminatha  
Iyer, Mu. Raghava Iyengar and Chengalvarya   
Pillai. His work as a member of the Committee for the preparation of of  
authentic Tamizh Lexicon made him a perfect master.   
On the emotional side the Freedom Movement under the leadership of Mahatma  
Gandhi lifted him out of ordinary humdrum   
life and made him yearn for freedom from the millions of his fellow  
countrymen. We find him giving expression to this in his   
'Swantra Geetham'. This works also marks him out as a poet with great  
potential, a budding genius.   
It was at this stage that a wholly new chapter opened up in Muruganar's life.  
His father-in-law Dhandapani Swami, an   
ardent devotee of Sri Bhagavan and an inmate of Sri Ramanasramam came to his  
house with a gift of two works of   
Sri Bhagavan, 'Aksharamana Maalai' and 'Who am I?' The Swami's purpose in  
giving this gift was that Muruganar   
might truly flower as a poet by Sri Bhagavan's grace and he said so  
specifically. Little did he realize that he was part   
of the divine drama which had started unfolding. For one thing, the choice of  
books had a special significance. While   
Aksharamana Maalai is the last word in ecstatic devotional poetry, Who am I?  
contains the essence of Sri Bhagavan's   
direct path for self inquiry for Self Knowledge. The influence of these two  
streams of devotion and knowledge, bhakti,   
and jnana on Muruganar was profound. We often find that these two streams of  
'Praise' and 'Teachings' are blended and woven   
together in colorful variety in Muruganar's works. Also we have the two  
Muruganar's classics, Ramana Sannidhi Murai   
and Guru Vachaka Kovai. The first one places him on par with saints like  
Manikkavachagar, Jnana Sambandhar, Tiru   
Navukkarasar and Sundaramoorthy. The second one reveals that he as a Jnani  
experiencing the fruits of Sri Bhagavan's   
Way steadily and naturally

The second result of Dhandapani Swami's momentous visit and gift was its  
immediate and overwhelming impact.   
The two books immersed Muruganar in passion for Sri Bhagavan. He intuitively  
felt that Sri Bhagavan could only be   
the great God, Siva, the auspicious one to come to teach a new path to Wisdom,  
to enlightenment. The books also   
triggered memories of his timeless relationship with Sadguru Ramana. His  
thoughts ran thus. Sri Bhagavan was   
Siva who had come in ancient times to Perundurai to listen to the compositions  
of Manikkavachagar.   
Though Muruganar shuddered at the thought of being compared to  
Manikkavcahagar, there can be little doubt that   
he was cast in the same mold. This is apparent even from his very first  
composition on Sri Bhagavan, 'Desika Padigam'   
and also from his second important one 'Annamalai Ramanan'. So striking was  
the similarity between his style of writing   
and that of Manikkavachagar, that Sri Bhagavan could not help suggesting that  
he could follow in Vachagar's footsteps.   
This feat became possible by Sri Bhagavan's Grace.   
The moment Sri Bhagavan made him his own gazing at him with 'blazing, bright,  
and unwinking eyes' on the 23rd of September   
1923, Muruganar's personal life ended. Afterwards he lived wholly for and in  
Sri Bhagavan. Even so due to a sense of filial   
duty to his mother, he remained at home till 1926. Then cutting off all  
domestic bonds, he shifted to Tiruvannamalai ending   
the physical separation as well.

Arunachala Siva.

Kavyakanta Ganapti Muni and Muruganar are said to be the twin eyes of Sri  
Bhagavan, one representing the Sanskrit   
tradition and the other Tamizh, both of which are time honored and hoary. Sri  
Bhagavan of course, is the Source, the   
confluence of all that is sacred. Muruganar and Muni were together only  
between 1926 and 1929. Their relationship was   
marked by mutual respect and high esteem in which they held each other. In  
1928 at the instance of Muruganar, Sri   
Bhagavan composed His Ulladu Narpadu. While finalizing the order of the  
verses with Muruganar, Sri Bhagavan also   
sought the advice of the Muni. This helped the Muni in translating this work  
into Sanskrit as Sat Darsanam, which he did   
later while staying at Sirisi.   
Till Sri Bhagavan's Maha Nirvana, Muruganar was always in His presence. He  
was fully aware that the Master was not only   
the visible form but was universally pervasive. Yet the magnetism of the  
presence was too compelling. As he says in one of   
his verses: No form or feature, has He of of His own   
Yet form and feature to all beings to gives;   
Knowledge and ignorance, both to Him unknown,   
Each human mind from Him alone derives.   
He brought me into being....   
And He has left me wordless, deedless, prone,   
Helpless on death's brink,   
Only the vast beatitude endures.   
(Ramana Sannidhi Murai - Verse 1052)   
His poetry was like a perennial river with its ceaseless flow. He composed  
more than thirty thousand verses on a single   
subject, Sri Bhagavan in whose bliss he was soaked. One can say if Sri  
Bhagavan was an ideal Sadguru, Muruganar   
embodied in himself all the virtues enumerated for a disciple in the  
scriptures. His surrender was complete, his faith   
total, and all consuming.   
Readers of this book will find a detailed account of his life with Sadguru  
Ramana, his copious writings, the indelible mark   
on Tamizh poetry and his state of steady wisdom. The writers of the various  
articles have had the rare good fortune   
of being associated closely with Muruganar, his life and works. We therefore  
find the rich aroma of authenticity and   
a natural appeal.   
When the Ramana Maharshi Center of Learning came forward to celebrate the  
birth centenary of Muruganar it did so   
for it is an exceptional privilege and blessing. We were surprised when  
someone asked, 'Who is Muruganar? Why do we   
celebrate his birth centenary? Ignorance of true worth cannot be more  
colossal. Was he not the peerless Tamizh   
poet, a Jnani reveling in the Self? Yet coming to think of it they cannot be  
blamed entirely. If Muruganar's name is not   
found in the world's Hall of Fame, it is only because he wished it to be that  
way. Far from seeking name and fame he   
shunned it. What need was there for it? Sri Bhagavan had made him aware that  
he is the fullness of consciousness.   
Muruganar therefore remained content to be in the shadow of Sri Bhagavan's  
Feet enjoying to the brim its ambrosial   
sweetness.   
However, it seems Sri Bhagavan has decided that the time has now come for the  
world to know about Muruganar's   
position among the all time greats in the galaxy of poets. How else can we  
explain the all round enthusiasm for   
the celebration for the celebration of Muruganar's birth centenary?   
Many of his works are being translated into English, Hindi, Telugu, and  
Kannada. Books which have been out of   
print are being reprinted.   
In the first few years of his stay, Muruganar was living at Palakottu and  
devotees like Viswantha   
Swami, Narasimha Swami, Cohen, Paul Brunton and Kunju Swami were there in  
their little cottages or caves and they   
swarmed to Muruganar to listen to his exposition of Sri Bhagavan's teachings.   
In the last decade of his life, he was an inmate of the Asramam. The whole  
atmosphere would be surcharged with   
Sri Bhagavan's presence. When he breathed his last in August 1973, his body  
was buried within the premises of the   
Asramam and a Samadhi was built over it.   
Arunachala Siva.

**Complete Recitation of Ramana Sannidhi Murai   
Highly competent Odhuvars from great Siva temples in Tamil Nadu came to ashram  
and recited the complete Ramana Sannidhi Murai in front of Muruganar?s  
Samadhi. The three day function concluded today and was organized to follow  
Muruganar Memorial Day.   
Ramana Sannidhi Murai(RSM) is modeled after Tiruvachakam of Manickavachakar  
but is nearly three times longer. RSM consists of 126 hymns and 1851 verses  
compared to 51 hymns and 658 verses of Tiruvachakam. Sri Ramana Mahasrhi has  
emphatically declared that Ramana Sannidhi Murai composed by Muruganar is  
equal to (Nikare in Tamil) Tiruvachakam sung by Manickavachakar. To properly  
sing these songs special training is required and qualified musicians are  
known as Odhuvars. It is significant that Odhuvars who sing Tevaram and  
Tiruvachakam in Siva temples came and enthusiastically sang Ramana Sannidhi  
Murai in Ramanaramam.**

Dear Ravi,   
Nice anecdote from Maha Sawmi.   
Today is Vinyaka Chaturthi. Vinayaka or Ganesa's celebration day falls on the  
fourth day of waxing moon every year   
in the month of Avani (Simha month).   
Kavyakanta Ganapti Muni felt that he was Ganesa and thus the elder brother of  
Sri Bhagavan. In fact,he was born by   
prayer to the Lord by his father.   
Sri Bhagavan also prays to Ganapati while beginning His Aksharamana maalai  
singing: For making a garland of wedding   
to Arunachala,. the compassionate and graceful Ganapati, You extend Your  
helping hand and protect me to complete   
these verses.   
Once He prayed to Ganapati, at the instance of Eswara Swamigal in a verse on  
the Lord at niche. (see the follwoing   
post for the verse).   
Nambi Andaar Nambi who collated the Tevaram verses was a great Ganapti  
Upasaka. It is said that Ganapati took   
the prasadam offered by extending His trunk!   
I remember only the pujas done in Tiruchirapalli, Rockfort, to Uchhip  
Pillaiyar. I have no seen Pillaiyar Patti,in Sivaganga.   
Arunachala Siva.

The following is the verse written by Bhagavan on the Ganesa in the niche: பிள்ளையாய்ப் பெற்றவனைப் பிச்சாண்டி ஆக்கி எங்கும்   
பிள்ளையாப் பேழ் வயிற்றைப் பேணினீர் \- பிள்ளையான்   
கன்நெஞ்சோ மாடத்துப் பிள்ளையாரே கண் பாரும்   
பின் வந்தான் தன்னை நீர் பெற்று.   
You have made Your father who gave birth to You, as an alms-seeker;   
You as His son everywhere took care of your large belly by eating prasadam.   
O is your heart made of stone, O Ganapati in the niche!   
Please show your gaze to me who came after You, (as Subrahmanya) and give me  
food.

celebrate the occasion, and this is what Sri Bhagavan wrote. Interestingly  
Ramana Maharshi has followed the tradition of invoking Lord Ganesha?s Grace  
before writing Aksharamanamali.   
On the auspicious occasion of Ganseha Chaturthi we worship Lord Ganesha with  
the verses composed by Ramana Maharshi.   
 _Him, who begot you as a child, you made   
Into a beggar; as a child yourself   
You then lived everywhere just to support   
Your own huge belly. I too am a child.   
You Child God in that niche! encountering one   
Born after you, is your heart made of stone?   
I pray you look at me._   
Invocation in Aksharamanamalai by Sri Bhagavan   
 _Gracious Ganapati! with Thy (loving) hand bless me, that I may make this a  
marital garland of letters worthy of Sri Arunachala, the bridegroom!_**

**While Lord Ganesha has many names the following 16 names are considered to  
be quite sacred and worthy of being chanted daily especially before we start  
any work. They are recited either as individual namavali or like a verse   
 **16 Names of Ganesha in various tunes**

Dear Subramanian Sir and Nagaraj   
Both of you have given different explanations for the word சதுரன. From one  
angle we can say God is very clever and from another angle the word சதுரன  
represents 4 and what 4 does it imply here ?   
Ramalinga Swamigal's poems are quite simple and straight forward but inside  
those simplicity he puts in **few words** that are rarely used or that have a  
very different meaning from what we normally associate with and we need to dig  
in deeply to understand what they mean. Like here சதுரன normally means clever  
but I feel here it can refer to the Number 4 but what 4 does he mean can vary  
eg is it the 4 Vedas, the 4th state - Turiya. Some even say here சதுரன  
refers to the 4 types of way we reform a person - saama, dana, bheda, dhanda  
. Let us see the views of others.

Dear atmavichar,   
I shall further clarify this from a Tiruvachakam verse, in Koil Triuppadigam,  
(Decad on Koil, that is Chidambaram).   
தந்தது உன் தன்னைக் கொண்டது என் தன்னைச்   
 சங்கரா யார் கொலோ சதுரர்   
அந்தம் ஒன்றில்லா ஆனந்தம் பெற்றேன்   
 யாது நீ பெற்றது ஒன்று என்பால்?   
சிந்தையே கோயில் கொண்ட எம் பெருமான்   
 திருப்பெருந்துறை உறை சிவனே   
எந்தையே ஈசா உடல் இடம் கொண்டாய்   
 யான் இதற்கு இலன் ஓர் கைம்மாறே.   
Chengalvaraya Pillai who is an expert in Tiruvachakam, translates this verse  
as: You have given Yourself to me. You have taken myself to You.   
O Sankara! Who is the CLEVERER than the two?   
I have attained limitless Bliss.   
What have You attained from me?   
O Lord who has taken my Heart as Abode,   
the Lord of Tiruperundurai.   
O Father! You have occupied my body.   
What recompense can I pay for You?   
Here the word Chaturar is translated as cleverer.   
The word Chaturar comes from the Sanskrit word Chaaturyam, which means  
cleverness.   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear friends,   
 _ **" One should not reason too much; it is enough if one loves the Lotus  
Feet of the Mother. Too much reasoning throws the mind into confusion. You get  
clear water if you drink from the surface of a pool. Put your hand deeper and  
stir the water, and it becomes muddy. Therefore pray to God for devotion."**_   
Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna

Dear Subramaniam Sir   
Thanks for the verse of Thiruvachagam where a similar word is used. Saint  
Ramalinga Swamy had the greatest admiration of Thiruvachagam and some people  
even say that Thiruaruta is an elaboration of Thiruvachagam.   
One more thing with regard to Thiruarutpa and Saint Ramalinga Swamigal is that  
there are many Tamil fanatics who claim that Vallalar was anti sanskrit. It  
is true that Vallar rebelled against the Chdiambaram Dikshitars and in protest  
started his own Temple at Vadalur where he devised his own unique form of  
Light Worship that was devoid of the Vedic Rituals etc but Vallalar was not  
anti sanskrit and his poems did borrow many sanskrit terms. However he also  
proved that he could compose Poems free of sanskrit words and many of his  
poems have pure tamil in them but he was never anti sanskrit.   
One of his famous work is called Thiruvadi Pugachi and it is a devotional hymn  
to Lord and it has 3 parts and first part is highly Sanskritzed Tamil, Second  
Part is a mixture of Tami and Sanskrit and Third Part is pure Tamil showing  
that he loves both Sanskrit as well as Tamil.
