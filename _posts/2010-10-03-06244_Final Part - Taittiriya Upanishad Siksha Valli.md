**Contemplation of Brahman: (Anuvaga 6 of Sikshavalli)**   
In the bright space within the heart He is, that Soul who is formed of  
thought, undying full of light. In the mid region of the throat's two pillars,  
that which hangs down like a nipple, that is the birth place of Indra, where  
the hair ends splits up dividing the two regions of the skull. (6.1)   
 **In Agni as Bhuh he rests, in Vayu as Bhuvah, in Aditya as Suvah, in Brahman  
as Mahah. He attains self lordship. He attains to the lord of manas, the lord  
of speech (vak), the lord of sight (chakshu), the lord of hearing (srodra),  
the lord of intelligence (vgnyana). Then he becomes as the Brahman whose body  
is the bright space, whose nature is love, whose delight is life, whose manas  
is bliss, who is replete with peace, who is immortal. (6.2)**   
In other words, the contemplator becomes a svaraj, i.e., an independent lord  
due to contemplation of the Divine Being. **To him all gods will offer tribute  
in subordination to him.**   
 **Contemplation of Brahman in the invisible:  **Note** : **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says Mind impact will be there in  
the body and vice versa is also true.   
Suppose if we loose 10 lakhs though our mind gets affected but immediately our  
body gets impacted like we may sit down crying for some time etc.   
Man breathes 21,600 in a day.   
He says in people who are pandit in Sora Sastram can even predict the life-  
span of human depending on breathing. (kumbaka,rechaka)   
He praised Swami Rama Tirtha a lot and eloborated his life span and sais his  
jivita charitra was his inspiration in his childhood.**

(Anuvaga 7 of Sikshavalli)**   
 **Contemplation of Hiranyagarbha** : Earth is the mid region, heaven the main  
quarters and the intermediate quarters are Agni, Vayu, Aditya and Chandramas  
and the Nakshatras. Waters, plants, trees, the bright space (Aakasa) and the  
Athman (Soul) thus far among the external beings.   
 **Contemplation as to the Self** : Prana, vyana, apana, udana, samana ; the  
eye, the ears, the manas, speech, touch, skin, flesh, muscle, bone, marrow;   
 **Prana - in the heart;** Apana - in the anus; Samana - in the navel; Udana -  
in the region of throat; Vyana - traverses the whole body.   
 **Pankta verily, is this all** : by Pankta indeed does one the pankta  
strengthen. (Yajna is a pankta)   
 **Contemplation of Pranava: (Anuvaga 8 of Sikshavalli)**   
 **OM is Brahman. OM is this all.** OM is verily compliance and on uttering "O  
recite", they begin to recite. With OM they begin samans. OM SOM - with this  
they tell the prayers. OM - Thus does the adhvaryu convey acceptance. OM -  
thus assents the Brahma (priest). OM - thus one permits the offering of an  
oblation to fire. OM - thus says the Brahmana who is about to recite - "May I  
obtain Brahman" \- thus wishing Brahman verily does he obtain. (Adhvaryu - the  
priest who performs the acts enjoined in the Yajurveda)   
A Brahmana utters OM and OM alone and by that syllable OM, he attains Brahman.   
All undertakings which start with the syllable OM become fruitful, therefore  
one should contemplate the syllable OM as Brahman.   
 **Note** : **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says If we live without thoughts  
then our mind/buddhi can become hard useless(moddu/banda baripovatam).   
Only If we think we will get buddhi(buddi kalugutundi).**   
By doing karma then our suddhi will get clean and will become available for  
getting jnana.   
 **Upasaka 's Duties: (Anuvaga 9 of Sikshavalli)**   
This Anuvaga describes the duties of a Upasaka towards the following as well  
as the need for study and teaching: the right, truth, penance, restraint, peace, the fire, offerings to fires,  
guests, the human, the off spring, begetting, propogation of the race as well  
as studying and teaching.   
The right: - the learning of one's own veda and pravachana - which means  
either adhyapana - the teaching of it (or) Brahma Yajna - a daily solemn  
recitation of it;   
 **truth: - truth speaking;   
penance: - tapas or bodily mortification;   
restraint: - Dama-calmness of the organs of external sensation; Tranquility  
(Sama) - calmness of manas, the internal organ;**   
While practising these, fires should be consecrated and oblations offered to  
them;   
 **guests should be honoured;**   
 **the human - that is - social duties (such as marriages) should be  
discharged as occasions arise;   
off spring should be begotten by having intercourse with wife in season at  
periods favorable for conception;   
the race should be propagated through children's children, by getting the sons  
married.**   
 **Definition of Penance** : He who thus knowing studies the vedas even when  
it rains and lightens, when it roars and thunders, when the wind is blowing  
even on the new moon day, he only practices penance; study, indeed is penance.  
**Standing or walking sitting or lying down, he shall not fail to recite the  
Veda; then he is a man of penance, he is pure, who thus knowing recites the  
Veda.**   
 **Note: Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says according to bg gita man cannot be  
silent even for a minute without doing karma.   
In East Godavari Districts they call salt as 'Ruchi'.**   
We should always speak truth.   
Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says "Srama yeva Jayante" is wrong and "Satyameva  
Jayante" is correct.   
All sep11 attacks(as the persons involved would have done much srama) and all  
wrong deeds will also come under "Srama yeva Jayante" so that is the reason it  
is wrong.   
 **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says in olden days when anyone died relatives  
will come to know say after 5-6 months as there was no communication available  
like telephones,cell phones etc and only letters(telegrams).**   
In our childhood child are kept in craddle as we want to keep safe our kid as  
any animal can harm them like snakes etc as child has no buddhi to  
discriminate between good and bad.   
 **Sri Sundara chaitanya swami daily sleeps at night 12.00 AM and wakes up  
again at 4.00 AM.**   
 **A mantra to be repeated: (Anuvaga 10 of Sikshavalli)**   
The mover of the tree I am. My fame is like the mountain's peak. The high one  
making (one) pure. I am the very immortal one as He is in the Sun. I am the  
lustrous wealth. I am of high Wisdom, immortal, undecaying. - Thus runs Sage  
Trisanku's teaching of Wisdom.   
The tree of Samsara being cut as under, the fame becomes like unto a  
mountain's peak; it rises, as the mountain's peak is high. The fame concerning  
his liberation rises very high and spreads in the region of Devas; so that  
even Devas cannot thwart his wishes; not even Devas have power to prevent his  
becoming Brahman.   
According to Sage Trisanku, the recitation of this mantra constitutes the  
austerity of vedic recitation known as Brahma Yajna, which one should practice  
after learning the Veda from a teacher.   
 **The Exhortation: (Anuvaga 11 of Sikshavalli)**   
 **Having taught the Veda, the teacher then exhorts the pupil; speak the truth  
(satyam vada); follow dharma (dharmam chara); from study swerve thou not.  
Having offered dear wealth to the teacher cut thou not the progeny 's line.**  
From the true it will not do to swerve, nor from Dharma nor from welfare.  
Neither will it do to swerve from well being, nor from study and teaching, nor  
from duties to Devas and Pitris. (11.1)   
Treat your mother as a God. **(maatru devo bhava)**   
Treat your father as a God. **(pithru devo bhava)**   
Treat your teacher as a God. ( **acharya devo bhava)**   
Treat the guests also as God. **(adhiti devo bhava)**   
 **What works are free from fault, they should be resorted to, not others.  
What are good works of ours, they should be done, not others. (11.2)**   
Whatever Brahmanas are better than ourselves, in their sitting it will not do  
for you to breathe. With reverence should gifts be made, never with  
irreverence should a gift be made, with liberality should gifts be made, with  
modesty should gifts be made, with fear should a gift be given, in  
friendliness should a gift be given. (11.3)   
If to you a doubt as to a deed or a doubt as to conduct, should occur as the  
Brahmanas there who are thoughtful, zealous, well versed, not hard (at heart),  
desirous of Dharma - would act in such matters, so there shall you act. Now as  
to the accused: - " as the Brahmanas there who are thoughtful, zealous, well  
versed, not hard (at heart), desirous of Dharma - would act in such matters"  
\- This is the direction; this is the advise; this the secret of Vedas; this  
the command; thus shall devotion be and thus verily all this shall you  
observe. (11.4)   
 **Note** : **Sri Sundara chaitanya Swami says Gruhastas should do annual  
cermony compulsory.For sanyasis it is not compulsory as they have removed  
complete attachment to the body.   
Treat your mother as a God. (maatru devo bhava) means treat mother as a god  
but mother is not god at all.**   
We should respect in order wise like first mother should be respected then  
father and next comes guru.   
Guru is very much important as it is only he who removes ignorance in us.   
 **Thanks Giving: (Anuvaga 12 of Sikshavalli)**   
OM: May Mitra be propitious to us and Varuna propitious be; may Aryaman  
propitious be to us; propitious be Indra and Brihaspathi to us; to us  
propitious may Vishnu of vast extent be. Bow to Brahma, Bow to you Vayu ! You  
are indeed Brahman perceptible. You indeed have I declared Brahman  
perceptible. The right have I declared; and I have declared the truth. That  
has protected me and that has protected the teacher; yes that has protected  
me; that has protected the teacher.   
Note: **Sri Sundara Chaitanya Swami says In Adarvana Vedam it is written that  
we should earn with 100 hands to do charity with 1000 hands.**
