What is Ramanuja's mistake on qualified non dualism?   
What is Brahman?   
What is aeon?   
What is Jeevanmuktas?   
What is non-dualism?   
What is qualified?   
I admit i cannot understand, please make me clear   
Thanks

Dear karthikeyan. M   
1. Qualified Nondualism is Brahman is non dual, formless, but one   
has to remain, after liberation, with a formful god, Ramanuja   
called it Narayana and the liberated souls should remain in   
Vaikunta for the aeon to close.   
2. This is the mistake committed by Ramanuja. He made a 'qualification' for Brahman, called it Narayana and said about   
'waiting period'. Thus he gave rise to religion which is not   
philosophy. Religion took the upperhand and it created problems   
with other religions. Advaita has no quarrel with any other religion,   
as Gaudapada said in his Karika.   
3\. Non dualism is formless Brahman. He is ever present within you,   
and not outside in any deities or images or icons. As a concession   
for beginners, Sankara approved forms and he even wrote hymns   
on these deities also.   
4\. Aeon or eaon is a long period, what we call Yuga in Sanskrit.   
5\. A Jeevanmukta is one who is liberated even when he is still alive   
in the body. Like Sankara and Bhagavan Ramana. Since there is a   
long waiting period in Vaikunta, as per qualifed non dualism, the   
concept of Jeeven Mukta cannot be there in that philosophy.   
6. Liberation is moksha, without any rebirth. Vaikunta, Swarga,   
Kailasa, Hell are all temporary waiting sheds. From each of these,   
one has to come back to earth to work it out. Only liberated souls merge with  
Brahman after this waiting period.   
Arunachala Siva.

Coming to understand that   
1) Narayana is everywhere, he present in everything, i.e what we call the  
Universe and everything is Narayana   
2) If a person gets moksha even if he is living such as Sankara, Ramana does  
they go the Kailasa for only for time being and return to earth after some  
time or they stay there forever.   
3) If a person gets liberated after death, if he is good does he reaches  
Vaikunta, Kailasa and stays they forever or after something he comes back to  
earth as human.   
4) Coming to the mistake part: What wrong has to do with 'waiting period'   
Does it means it takes time to receive the blessing or darshan of the Lord   
After that period of time one goes to vaikunta.   
(I doubt I'm still not clear)

1\. Brama Jnanis like Sankara and Ramana got liberated while in   
life in a body. This means that they have merged with Brahman.   
For them, there is no going or coming i.e going to Vaikunta or   
Kailasa or Swarga or Naraka. They have merged once and for all   
with Brahman. They have no individual identity any longer. It is   
like water mixing with milk.   
2\. People who are liberated at the time of death, they also merge   
in Brahman. For them also there is no going or coming. Many   
Saiva Siddhanta saints like Tiru Navukkarasar come under this category.   
3. By waiting period, I mean, they wait near the Vaikunta or   
Kailasa, seeing Narayana or Siva and then at the end of the aeon,   
yuga, they merge with Brahman, the One without a second.   
4\. For ordinary people who are meritorious or demeritorius they   
go to Heaven or Hell and after their 'bank balance' of credit or   
debit balance is over, they return to earth to start the game again.   
They are not liberated in either way, till they understand and   
merge with the Self.   
Arunachala Siva.
