They alone live who live for others, the rest are more dead than alive.   
Whatever you think, that you will be. If you think yourself weak, weak you  
will be, if you think yourself strong, strong you will be.   
Faith in God, Faith in ourselves, this is the secret of greatness.   
How can we see evil unless it is in us?   
Only those who want nothing are masters of Nature.   
You cannot believe in God, until you believe in yourself.   
Everything can be sacrificed for truth, but truch cannot be sacrificed for  
anything.   
Seek the science of the maker, and not that of the made.   
Work on with the intrepidity of a lion, but at the same time, with tenderness  
of love.   
Impure imagination is as bad as impure action.   
Truth must have no compromise.   
Thirst for name and fame is the worst filth.   
There is nothing holier in the world than to keep good company.   
What we want is neither happiness nor misery; If the mind is pleased with  
praise, it will be displeased with blame.   
To work you have the right, but not to the result.   
The greatest sin is to think yourself weak.   
Dare to come to Truth even through hell.   
What we call nature, fate, is simply God's Will.   
Choose the highest ideal and live your life up to that.   
The whole ocean is present at the back of each wave.

Q: Does not a jnani feel sorrow when his child dies, does he not suffer?   
M: He suffers with those who suffer. The event itself is of little importance,  
but he is full of compassion for the suffering being, whether alive or dead,  
in the body or out of it. After all, love and compassion are his very nature.  
He is one with all that lives and love is that oneness in action.   
Q: People are very much afraid of death.   
M: **The jnani is afraid of nothing.** But he pities the man who is afraid.  
After all to be born, to live and to die is natural. To be afraid is not. To  
the event, of course, attention is given.   
Q: Imagine you are ill -- high fever, aches, shivers. The doctor tells you the  
condition is serious, there are only a few days to live. What would be your  
first reaction?   
M: No reaction. As it is natural for the incense stick to burn out, so it is  
natural for the body to die. Really, it is a matter of very little importance.  
What matters is that I am neither the body nor the mind. I am.   
Q: Your family will be desperate, of course. What would you tell them?   
M: The usual stuff: fear not, life goes on, God will protect you, we shall be  
soon together again and   
so on. But to me the entire commotion is meaningless, for I am not the entity  
that imagines itself alive or dead. I am neither born nor can I die. I have  
nothing to remember or to forget.   
Q: How does the jnani fare after death?   
M: The jnani is dead already. Do you expect him to die again?   
Q: Are sin and virtue one and the same?   
M: These are all man-made values! What are they to me? What ends in happiness  
is virtue, what ends in sorrow is sin. Both are states of mind. Mine is not a  
State of mind.   
Q: There is some mystery in it which I cannot fathom. How can the mind be a  
part of nature?   
M: **Because nature is in the mind; without the mind where is nature?**   
Q: If nature is in the mind and the mind is my own, I should be able to  
control nature, which is not really the case. Forces beyond my control  
determine my behaviour.   
M: **Develop the witness attitude and you will find in your own experience  
that detachment brings control. The state of witnessing is full of power,  
there is nothing passive about it.**

A Brahma Jnani like Bhagavan Ramana is like a mirror. He simply   
reflects the emotions and feelings of the suffering devotees.   
But He knew that everything is unreal. But He also sympathizes   
with people who suffer. He reflects their sorrows. Once Echammal   
came to Him, crying, with the grandson on her hand, when her   
foster daughter, had died, after delivering the baby. She cried   
inconsolably. Bhagavan Ramana also wept on seeing her conditions. This is a  
Brahma Jnani's attitude. He is full of compassion and grace. But at the same  
time, He does not disturb the destiny. For Him, there is neither destiny nor  
free will. He is beyond both. Bhagavan Ramana also expressed the same  
emotions when Subbramaiah came to Him, after his wife had died and ten day   
ceremonies were over. In this case, Bhagavan Ramana did not   
cry but gazed him with a flood of sympathy and compassion.   
And this was a real tonic for G.V. Subbramaiah.   
Arunachala Siva.
