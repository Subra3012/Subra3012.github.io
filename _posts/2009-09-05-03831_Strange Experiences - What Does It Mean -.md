## Strange Experiences - What Does It Mean ?

Hello   
I have recently had some very strange experiences and perhaps somebody can  
guide me to what they mean.   
I did a 3 day intense course 6am-11pm x 3 days. The exercise that we  
performed for this time was to ask ourselves who am i continually for the  
entire duration of the course with intense focus.   
Towards the end I had a number of different experiences: (1) I had a very intense body feeling and saw white light emanating from one  
of the other course participants that eventually filled all my vision, within  
this I saw first the buddha in an orange glow, and then spiritual woman,  
perhaps the Virgin Mother.   
(2) At a different time this happened : I was relaxing just gazing at the  
ceiling of a room and lying on my back, suddenly I saw through the ceiling and  
something very strange happened, I saw beyond. .. the world. I understand  
that the world is just a molecular clock, just atoms and molecules, and that  
the reason why we see walls and floors, hands and people, is because of the  
mental modifications of what we are witnessing. For a split second my mind  
did not modify anything and I saw the world as it is just molecules. It is a  
world without any values at all. It is frightening because everything you  
know (friends family love etc...) vanish in a world without values.   
(3) I had the experience of waking up. It was shocking. I woke up for a  
split second and then fell back to sleep (normal life). Again and again. ..  
every 20 or 30 seconds I woke up and fell back to sleep. When I woke up I  
realised that life is a dream, but you cannot understand it unless you wake  
up. This continual waking and falling back asleep was extremely traumatic and  
felt like I was going to go mad, but finally a few days after the course it  
stopped happening. I don't think I am ready for this experience - it is too  
much.   
Anyway, if anybody understands what these experiences mean I would be  
interested to hear what you say.   
Thanks   
Sacha

Dear rideforever,   
Yes. What munagala said is correct. Some visions do happen,   
when one enquires within, or do intense meditation. You have   
to go past these visions. These do come and go. Do not try to   
interpret these visions. No one can tell what these are. You have to   
ask who is the person who is seeing these visions. You will find   
that it is the 'I' within. Many times, it could be the ego. On a   
few rare occasions, it could be the Self, the I-I. Go past till you   
permanently abide in It.   
Once someone asked Bhagavan Ramana: "Bhagavan! If Siva comes   
before you, what will you say?" Bhagavan replied: " Do not have this coming  
and going business with me." That is the answer!   
Arunachala Siva.

Hi   
Now I'm here I'll give my answer too.   
Before I found a guru - better : he found Me - I had horrible   
experiences like you when trying meditation   
on my own or even doing Hatha Yoga   
from the booklet of Yogi RamaCharaka   
which are very good for the body and balancing the chakras   
And then it happend - say the 5th time that I was envelopped in a black   
sticky substance and I couldn't move with my mind   
and when you say it was every where, yes and in your case it was A BIG NOTHING  
and I understand that is somewhat the same   
So, after regaining myself to normal with grand   
difficulty, I szweared never ever ever to do kind of meditation stuff in   
my life anymore.   
Some time later I read that - for sensible people - it can be dangerous   
without guidance.   
These inner spheres you enter in are a complete universe   
and much more dangerous than the amazone river, pirhanas included.   
So many people couldn'tcope and are in mental institutions.   
These regions - ion the Astral but perhaps lower in the   
etheric energy around us, better inside of us   
if you are able to cope are so trickery.   
Yes Shiva can come before you and it is a demon able to take   
that form.   
All the Bhuddist Boddisatvas are luring at the sides of the first crooked  
tunnel   
going to the astral region (read the Thibatan Book of the Dead)   
and many bhave important powers to deceive us.   
And the Astral, although there are xillions of our type 'big bang' universes   
in it - is just a snowflock compared with the Causal region   
where Ramana Maharshi has His temporal Residence from time to time   
to give guidance.   
From the Astral to the Causal \- after you have conceived all astral concepts   
ideas and "non-existances" \- AND with permission of the Deity   
there responsable for its existance and maintenance ( a big guy -, the  
Christians call him Jehova, - he's not very nice - he doesn't care meat  
eating - it   
holds the souls in his web - he is the owner - seen The Ring Film - he's   
so tricky as the little man advising Frodo ) - anyway - he will not allow you  
to the Causal, where he himself has no permission to go.   
HÃ© this seems the opposite almost of Jnana but it is not !   
 - I better stop - I first wait if this kind of INFO is allowed on this forum   
because it has not even started yet.   
PRAY, Praying is the answer Sir, and a veggy life,. . Pray for Guidance   
Ask God if you may be granted some love for Him or Her or It   
and He will come faster than lightning if your Praying was innocent.   
"He has Thousand Fingers on his Trigger"   
the whole process will repeat itself   
untill a soul finds out that the Causal is also a snowflock if not more tny   
and unsignificant   
And this what I wrote is not even a   
So, when I read that in a leaflet
