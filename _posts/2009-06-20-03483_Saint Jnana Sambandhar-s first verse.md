## Pamban Swamigal - Some more information  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 19, 2009, 01:46:58 PM  
---  
1\. When Pamban Swamigal was 13 years old, he went to the   
coconut garden of his father along with him. It was quite   
early in the morning. He said he would wait at the entrance   
and bid his father go in. When there were first rays of sun,   
he was chanting Skanda Sashti Kavacaham of Bala Devaraya   
Swamigal. He suddenly felt an urge to compose poems. He   
took out a silver writing instrument from his hip, picked a dry   
palmyra leaf and starting writing his first poem, starting as   
To Siva who carries Ganga and who begot Skanda as his   
own form.   
2. He wrote 100 songs in 100 days. He was given upadesa   
of Sadakshara Mantra of Skanda by one brahmin later.   
3\. He got married and became father of three children. Suddenly he felt that  
he should take sannyasa and leave   
the family. A brahmin appared when he was stepping out   
of the house and prevented him from going. He said 'Skanda   
is calling me, I shall go.' However that brahmin did not permit   
him. Skanda appeared in his dream and said: 'How can you say   
I permitted you to take up sannyasa. It is all your ego's   
mischief. Stay with family for some more time and complete   
the life's purpose.' Then the saint realized that the brahmin   
was none other than Skanda.   
4. He was again taught Dahara Vidya, Upasana in Heart   
centre by another brahmin. Bhagavan's method may also   
be Dahara Vidya, but He did not specifically say so in any   
of His conversations. The saint started treating Skanda   
as Siva, Uma, Ganapati, Vishnu -- all in one. He called   
Skanda as six faced Siva.   
5\. He met with an accident in Madras. He was hospitalized   
with fracture in both legs. The doctors said that it would take   
six months to get cured. But in night, the doctors and others   
saw the saint's two legs supported by Spears! He got cured   
in 11 days.   
6\. Pamban Swamigal had written in all 6666 verses with   
20 prose essays. He completed his works with the famous   
Panchamirta Varnam, where he profoundly thank Arunagiri   
Natha, as he had taken a vow that he would complete his   
compositions with the last song mentioning Arunagiri Natha.   
7. He attained Maha Nirvana at the age of 79 in Tiruvanmiyur   
in Madras.   
8. In Tiruchendur when devotees were singing his songs,   
one old lady of 80 years saw a young lad with two young girls   
with him, standing in cognito and lisening to the songs! She   
said it was Skanda, VaLLi and Deivayanai. This place   
is now built with a nice hall for singing Tiruppugazh and   
songs of Pamban Swamigal.   
9. Pamban Swamigal has done a lot of magic with words   
in his poems. All his 6666 songs have been published   
but these are not available now readily. His few songs   
have become more famous and these are sung along with   
Tiruppugazh songs in various towns and cities.   
10. In Panchamirta Vannam last song, he makes a canvas   
where Skanda is dancing with 40 other gods and animals   
including the Rooster and the Peacock. This is easily the   
most wonderful song of the saint poet.   
Arunachala Siva.

## Saint Jnana Sambandhar's first verse  
Author: Subramanian.R       Date: June 20, 2009, 02:17:33 PM  
---  
Saint Jnana Sambandhar sang his first verse when he was   
three years old, in Seerkazhi, when Uma and Siva appeared   
before him and Uma gave her breast milk to make the child   
stop crying. The Saint poet sang then the first song. The   
first verse is quite meaningful: I prayed to Siva with ear-stud, Thodu in Tamil: Here by mentioning earstud the poet thanks both Uma and   
Siva, because Thodu is an ear stud that is adorned by women.   
The word Thodu, starts with Th+O. Here, the letter O denotes   
omkara or pranava, the primordial sound, from which creation   
starts.   
One who is riding on the Bull, Vidai in Tamil.   
Vidai or bull is Dharma-devata. The world is sustained by   
Dharma devata which is the vehicle of Siva.   
One who wears the cresecent moon. Moon got curse from   
his father-in-law and he started losing his digits and was   
about one become naught. Siva took him on his crest and   
made him grow again. Here it means, AruL or Grace after   
forgiving.   
One who wears the ashes from the cremation ground. Here   
the cremation ground and the ashes represent dissolution.   
One who stole my mind or Heart. If you take it as mind,   
then it means mind-destruction, which is for Self realization.   
If you take it as Heart, then Siva stays in Heart as the Self.   
This is realization and the purpose of life. Stealing of the   
mind also represents Tirodhana or hiding sakti of Uma, which   
veils the true knowledge.   
Thus the first verse covers, creation, sustenance, forgiving   
and gracing, dissolution and Tirodhana and Self Realization.   
(From a discourse in Sri Sankara TV.)   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Thank you very much for the meaning of the song. You could have added the  
story when did Sambandar sing this song. So that we can picturise the scene of  
the event.

I have visited Seerkazhi in the month of March 2009, there is pond in the  
temple and has a huge board on the entrance of the pond saying that this is  
the place that Lord Siva and Uma gave blessings to Saint Jnana Sambandhar, I  
think the lord gave darshan nearby the pond, i have earlier got to know of  
this story of Saint Jnana Sambandhar from Periyarpuranam, at that time of my  
visit, i just look at blue sky, few clouds, hoping (a belief) Lord well give  
his darshan to me too.   
A visit to Seerkazhi is a must.

Dear Aham Brahmasmi,   
Very happy to know about your visit to Seerkazhi. It is   
a sublime town where Skanda in his avatara as Jnana   
Sambandha had the vision of Uma and Siva. It happened   
when he was three years old. His father was diving into   
the tank and doing Ahamarshana Mantram. Seeing that   
his father was missing, Jnana Sambandha cried! The   
crying was a drama to reveal his avatra-mahima. Siva   
and Uma appeared on the towers of the Temple, when he   
was crying at the bank of the tank. Uma gave her breast   
milk to her son! There was some milk still left on his lips.   
The father on returning, asked the child: Why gave you milk?   
Then the child sang the first verse of his compositions. His   
father also saw the divine mother and father on the temple   
towers. Seerkazhi and Madurai are two places of avatara   
of Skanda viz., Jnana Sambandha [6th Century AD] and   
Bhagavan Ramana [1880-1950 AD]. Both are great places.   
Arunachala Siva.

Adi shankra sang in his Sowdharya lahari about Sambandar... The lines comes  
like..Dravida shishu. Sankra also wants the wisdom milk from Uma (jnanap pal)  
to have. From this statement we can come to know that Sambandar was there  
before Shankara. I may be wrong.   
comments please.....

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Adi Sankara lived after Tiru Jnana Sambandha. Tiru Jnana   
Sambandha's birth is roughly estimated around 6 Century   
AD. Sri Sankara has lived sometime in 7th Century AD.   
In Sri Soundarya Lahari, Sri Sankara has sung only about   
Tiru Jnana Sambandha. He calls him as Dravida Sisu, the   
son of Dravida land. Sri Kanchi Chandrasekara Saraswati   
also has said that this reference is about Tiru Jnana Sambandha.   
The dates mentioned above are rough estimates by Sri Neelakanta Sastri, in his  
book History of South India.   
Arunachala Siva.
