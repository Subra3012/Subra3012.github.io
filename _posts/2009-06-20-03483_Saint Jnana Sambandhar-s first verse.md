## Saint Jnana Sambandhar's first verse

Saint Jnana Sambandhar sang his first verse when he was   
three years old, in Seerkazhi, when Uma and Siva appeared   
before him and Uma gave her breast milk to make the child   
stop crying. The Saint poet sang then the first song. The   
first verse is quite meaningful: I prayed to Siva with ear-stud, Thodu in Tamil: Here by mentioning earstud the poet thanks both Uma and   
Siva, because Thodu is an ear stud that is adorned by women.   
The word Thodu, starts with Th+O. Here, the letter O denotes   
omkara or pranava, the primordial sound, from which creation   
starts.   
One who is riding on the Bull, Vidai in Tamil.   
Vidai or bull is Dharma-devata. The world is sustained by   
Dharma devata which is the vehicle of Siva.   
One who wears the cresecent moon. Moon got curse from   
his father-in-law and he started losing his digits and was   
about one become naught. Siva took him on his crest and   
made him grow again. Here it means, AruL or Grace after   
forgiving.   
One who wears the ashes from the cremation ground. Here   
the cremation ground and the ashes represent dissolution.   
One who stole my mind or Heart. If you take it as mind,   
then it means mind-destruction, which is for Self realization.   
If you take it as Heart, then Siva stays in Heart as the Self.   
This is realization and the purpose of life. Stealing of the   
mind also represents Tirodhana or hiding sakti of Uma, which   
veils the true knowledge.   
Thus the first verse covers, creation, sustenance, forgiving   
and gracing, dissolution and Tirodhana and Self Realization.   
(From a discourse in Sri Sankara TV.)   
Arunachala Siva.

Dear Subramaniyan ji   
Thank you very much for the meaning of the song. You could have added the  
story when did Sambandar sing this song. So that we can picturise the scene of  
the event.

I have visited Seerkazhi in the month of March 2009, there is pond in the  
temple and has a huge board on the entrance of the pond saying that this is  
the place that Lord Siva and Uma gave blessings to Saint Jnana Sambandhar, I  
think the lord gave darshan nearby the pond, i have earlier got to know of  
this story of Saint Jnana Sambandhar from Periyarpuranam, at that time of my  
visit, i just look at blue sky, few clouds, hoping (a belief) Lord well give  
his darshan to me too.   
A visit to Seerkazhi is a must.

Dear Aham Brahmasmi,   
Very happy to know about your visit to Seerkazhi. It is   
a sublime town where Skanda in his avatara as Jnana   
Sambandha had the vision of Uma and Siva. It happened   
when he was three years old. His father was diving into   
the tank and doing Ahamarshana Mantram. Seeing that   
his father was missing, Jnana Sambandha cried! The   
crying was a drama to reveal his avatra-mahima. Siva   
and Uma appeared on the towers of the Temple, when he   
was crying at the bank of the tank. Uma gave her breast   
milk to her son! There was some milk still left on his lips.   
The father on returning, asked the child: Why gave you milk?   
Then the child sang the first verse of his compositions. His   
father also saw the divine mother and father on the temple   
towers. Seerkazhi and Madurai are two places of avatara   
of Skanda viz., Jnana Sambandha [6th Century AD] and   
Bhagavan Ramana [1880-1950 AD]. Both are great places.   
Arunachala Siva.

Adi shankra sang in his Sowdharya lahari about Sambandar... The lines comes  
like..Dravida shishu. Sankra also wants the wisdom milk from Uma (jnanap pal)  
to have. From this statement we can come to know that Sambandar was there  
before Shankara. I may be wrong.   
comments please.....

Dear Ramanaduli,   
Adi Sankara lived after Tiru Jnana Sambandha. Tiru Jnana   
Sambandha's birth is roughly estimated around 6 Century   
AD. Sri Sankara has lived sometime in 7th Century AD.   
In Sri Soundarya Lahari, Sri Sankara has sung only about   
Tiru Jnana Sambandha. He calls him as Dravida Sisu, the   
son of Dravida land. Sri Kanchi Chandrasekara Saraswati   
also has said that this reference is about Tiru Jnana Sambandha.   
The dates mentioned above are rough estimates by Sri Neelakanta Sastri, in his  
book History of South India.   
Arunachala Siva.
