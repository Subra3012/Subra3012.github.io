## Bhagavan Ramana and other gurus

My dear ART, You have mentioned in the ground-ruless that   
members should quote only gurus who are dead for 50 years.   
I am of the humble view, that exception may be made in case   
of Kanchi Chandrasekara Saraswati, who lived for 101 years   
and shed his body about 15 years back. Bhagavan and he had   
mutual regard for each other. Chandrasekara has said that   
Bhagavan is an avatara of Kumarila Bhatta. Gurram Venkata   
Subbramaiah quotes both in his book and mentions about a   
dream in which both had appeared to him.

Dear srkudai, your one sentence observation is not quite clear to me.   
Do you mean that you are not able to know about a guru, becuase he is   
not in physical body? Tiruvalluvar, a great Tamil poet of ethics has said   
about 2000 years ago, in his Tirukkural, that one's greatness or worth   
is known by what he has left behind. Bhagavan has left behind Him,   
a good number of small Tamil works which are quite crisp. His talks   
have been recorded for about 4 years each by Munagala Venkatramaiah,   
Devaraja Mudaliar and Suri Nagamma. There is Ramanasramam, which   
you can visit. There is Tiruvannamalai, the Hill, which attracted Him and   
made Him live for 54 years in and near the Hill. He has Himself said,   
a Guru is one in whose Presence, you get Peace. You can read David   
Godman's Power of Presence, a book on His devotees, who were blessed by Him  
through His Presence. Even though He has shed His body, His   
Presence is being felt by many many people, who read His books, His   
biography, the records of His talks, His photographs etc., I am sure that   
if I have understood your question correctly, these answers should help you.  
Arunachala Siva.

Hi Srubramanian ji,   
Quote  
Do you mean that you are not able to know about a guru, becuase he is   
not in physical body?  
Yes, exactly. Sri Ramana is not the body, so he never died ! The body perished  
as even the rock by the side of a sea got eroded. Sri Ramana is not the body  
as much as he is not the rock ! So he remains what he was, is and will be.  
Now, Here to your left,right, up, above, below in and through u ! we  
are in his eternal embrace !   
Love!   
Silence

Dear srkudai, You are absolutely correct. One has to negate all the   
dualities. Birth-death, body-mind, happiness-sorrow, pain-pleasure,   
good-bad and all that. But one has to learn that "I am Brahman". Because,  
Brahman is the only thing which has no duality, the One without   
a second. Arunachala Siva.

If we experience self we will not impose our ideas on Gurus who are  
incarnations of pure conscious being.

Dear DRPVSSN Raju, yes, once a person realizes the Self,   
there is not need for any Guru, because, he is merging with   
the guru. But the original letter that I posted was, regarding   
Kanchi Chandrasekara, for comparing his ideas with those   
of Bhagavan. While Kanchi Chandrasekara was an epitome   
of dharma, Bhagavan was an epitome of the Self, and both   
had mutual regard for each other. In fact devotees went   
to both of them, to seek their doubts clarified for the purpose   
of Hindu dharma and the Self-enquiry.   
Arunachala Siva.
